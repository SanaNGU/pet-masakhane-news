politics	I'm a Celebrity: Adam Hills holds mock surgery in Hancock constituency	"Comedian Adam Hills has held a mock political surgery in the constituency of Matt Hancock, who remains on ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
f Channel 4's The Last Leg gave people in Mildenhall, Suffolk, the chance to raise concerns while their MP competes in the Australian jungle.
Hancock has faced criticism for joining the show when Parliament is sitting.
""Comedians shouldn't be doing the jobs of politicians,"" tweeted Hills, who said people had ""genuine issues"".
""It was a pleasure to meet the people of Mildenhall in Suffolk today. I hope their MP does the same soon,"" he posted.
In a tweet, which has since been deleted, police in Mildenhall thanked Hills for taking the time to visit the area and listen to the concerns of local residents. 
Speaking about the fake surgery on Good Morning Britain, Hills said: ""I thought people would have comedy issues but no, people wanted better access to public transport, to dentists, to doctors, all that kind of stuff.
""People aren't angry, they just want their MP to turn up and listen to their concerns.
""A whole bunch of people said it would just be nice to get a response, we've sent emails, we've sent letters and when that response is, 'I'm sorry, I'm eating a kangaroo's penis in the Australian jungle right now', that's kind of not what they're hoping for.""
Hancock has previously stressed the first thing he will do after leaving the jungle will be to return to West Suffolk and hold a surgery with his constituents.
In an interview before heading into the celebrity jungle, he said: ""There are lots of different ways to communicate with the public and we [politicians] are wrong if we think you can only do that on the traditional political shows where you are mainly only talking to people who take an active interest in politics.""
Watch: Boy George in tears over Matt Hancock's participation on reality show
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak previously said Hancock's decision to enter the jungle was not ""noble"" because he was failing to prioritise his ""constituents and our country"".
On Tuesday, campaigners flew a banner over the I'm A Celebrity campsite, reading: ""Covid bereaved say get out of here!""
In June last year, Hancock resigned as Health Secretary after he was caught breaking coronavirus social distancing rules by having an affair in his ministerial office with Gina Coladangelo, who was his aide at the time.

politics	COP27: Jailed activist Alaa Abdel Fattah stops drinking water	"Jailed British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel Fattah has stopped drinking water as he steps up his hunger strike to coincide with the start of the COP27 summit, his sister has said.
Calls for his release escalated after the climate summit opened in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt on Sunday.
40 year old has consumed just 100 calories for more than 200 days to push Egypt to allow him UK consular access.
UK PM Rishi Sunak has said he will raise the issue at the COP summit.
Abdel Fattah, a key activist in the 2011 Arab Spring, is currently serving a five-year sentence for spreading false news.
His sister, Sanaa Seif, has warned that her brother's hunger and water strike may mean he could die before the end of the summit.
Speaking to Sky News, she urged the British government to be ""responsible for getting us proof of life"".
Mr Sunak wrote to Abdel Fattah's family and said he would raise his imprisonment with the Egyptian government and reply again by the end of the summit.
He said the activist's case is ""a priority for the British government both as a human rights defender and as a British national"".
Ms Seif, a 28-year-old human rights activist who has served three prison sentences in Egypt herself on charges that fellow activists condemned as bogus, has been protesting outside the Foreign Office in London along with family members for her brother's release.
She expressed concerns that Downing Street's engagement with the Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi would come too late.
Amnesty International Secretary General Agnes Callamard said Abdel Fattah ""must be released"" and warned that he may only have 72 hours to live.
""Let's be very clear, we're running out of time,"" she said in Cairo on Sunday. ""So if the authorities do not want to end up with a death they should have and could have prevented, they must act now.
""If they don't, that death will be in every single discussion in this COP.""
Abdel Fattah's aunt, Ahdaf Soueif, told the BBC that the summit could be his last chance to be saved and to be released.
She urged Mr Sunak to secure her nephew's release.
""It means we really only have a few days,"" she said. ""None of us have any reason to believe that the regime will ever ever let him go.""
""He has known for a while that he's had enough, that he cannot live like this. And this is now his opportunity and all of ours really to bring matters to a head.
""He's betting on us and on the community inside Egypt that wants him released and on the international community that's making a noise for him.""
She said the UK government could use its influence to have him released.
""This is all in the hands of the British government to facilitate... it would be very difficult for the UK to do business as usual with Egypt unless this case is resolved. 
""And I think if the British government is serious and if Rishi Sunak says this convincingly, Alaa will be on a plane to London.""
Abdel Fattah played a key role in the protests that toppled the former Egyptian leader, Hosni Mubarak, from power in 2011.
He has been in jail for nine years and was sentenced to a further five years in 2021 on charges of ""broadcasting false news"" - a charge human rights groups condemned as spurious.
He received British citizenship in December 2021 through his London-born mother.
Human rights groups have said he is one of an estimated 60,000 Egyptian political prisoners and have accused the government in Cairo of trying to ""greenwash"" its repressive reputation through its hosting of the climate summit.
Egyptian government has insisted there are no political prisoners in the country."	/news/world-middle-east-63534578
entertainment	Mike Hodges: Flash Gordon and Get Carter director dies aged 90	"Mike Hodges, the director of films including Flash Gordon and Get Garter, has died aged 90.
His death was confirmed to the Guardian and US trade publication Variety by Mike Kaplan, a producer and longtime friend of Hodges.
rector reportedly died at his home in Dorset on Saturday. No cause of death has yet been announced.
Hodges' film credits include Croupier, The Terminal Man and 2003's I'll Sleep When I'm Dead, his final feature film.
Brian Blessed, who starred in Flash Gordon, paid tribute, praising Hodges for his ""powerful personality"" and ""brilliant imagination"".
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, Blessed said of Hodges: ""(Flash Gordon) is the only film, apart from Henry V with Kenneth Branagh, that I raced to the studio to start filming.
""Hodges (had a) brilliant imagination, but his direction - mind-blowing. Great manner, great perception. The film was a breath of fresh air.""
Writer and broadcaster Matthew Sweet said: ""A true master. A furious restless talent. An unassailable body of work. Loved the films. Loved the man.""
""I loved this man so much."" added Front Row presenter Samira Ahmed. ""The metaphysical poet of British cinema and a generous, brilliant, kind and politically engaged man.""
Born in Bristol in 1932, Hodges worked as a chartered accountant and spent two years serving on a Royal Navy minesweeper around fishing ports in the north of England.
His first job in the entertainment industry was working as a teleprompter operator for TV, which led him to producing and directing news and documentary series.
His first major feature film, released in cinemas in 1971, was an adaptation of Ted Lewis's novel Get Carter.
movie starred Sir Michael Caine as a London gangster who seeks his own form of justice after his brother is killed in Newcastle. 
Get Carter was a huge success, and prompted Hodges and Caine to reunite the following year for another film, Pulp.
One of the biggest films of his career, the space opera Flash Gordon, followed in 1980. 
movie saw warring factions of the planet Mongo unite against the oppression of Ming the Merciless. It starred Sam J Jones and Melody Anderson alongside Blessed and Timothy Dalton.
His other credits include the 1987 Mickey Rourke thriller A Prayer for the Dying and 1989's Black Rainbow, starring Rosanna Arquette.
Hodges' 1998 film Croupier, starring Clive Owen as a dealer in a gambling den who then gets roped into robbing it, failed to capture the UK box office when it was first released.
At that point, Hodges reportedly decided to retire, assuming his career was over. But the film was then released in the US to rave reviews and its success there prompted a second release in the UK. 
Hodges concluded his career as a feature film director the same way he began it, with a gangster film.
I'll Sleep When I'm Dead, released in 2003, saw him reunite with Owen, who played a criminal hungry for revenge after the rape of his younger brother.
Hodges is survived by his wife, Carol Laws and his sons Ben and Jake."	/news/entertainment-arts-64050014
business	Global firms are boosting baby formula supplies in the US	"Global firms are boosting supplies of baby formula in the US as the country grapples with a shortage.
Gerber-maker Nestle said it was flying additional shipments to the country from the Netherlands and Switzerland.
UK-based Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Enfamil and has factories in the US, has also said it has ramped up production by 30% this year.
move comes as US officials warned that resolution of the shortage remained months away.
On Monday, Abbott Laboratories, the biggest US supplier of powder infant formula brands such as Similac, reached a deal with regulators on steps needed to restart production at a key Michigan factory. It will take weeks for products to hit shelves after reopening, officials said.
Sturgis has been closed since February after bacteria was found in the facility, prompting recalls of several products.
utdown and recalls worsened a shortage that had been percolating for months due to supply chain and logistics delays and spiralled further after parents rushed to the stores to stock up.
White House has been under pressure to respond to the problem.
Worry and fear as baby formula shortage continues
On Monday, the US Food and Drug Administration said the US was working to address the issue, including easing rules to allow increased foreign shipments.
""With increased production by other manufacturers, forthcoming import actions and the potential for Abbott Nutrition's Sturgis facility to resume production in the near-term, the FDA expects supply to continue to improve over the next couple of months,"" it said. 
FDA said sales of infant formula rose 13% in April compared to January, before the recall, and some indicators suggested that the out-of-stock rates had been over-stated.
""Increased sales are a good indicator of formula available to the general population,"" it said."	/news/business-61484639
entertainment	K-pop star Jin from BTS begins military service	"Jin, the oldest member of K-pop mega-band BTS, has entered military service - the first of the group to do so.
30-year-old posted a photo of himself with his new military haircut before enlisting on Tuesday. ""It looks cuter than I expected,"" he said. 
As South Korea is still technically at war with its hostile neighbour North Korea, all able-bodied men are required to serve in the army.  
Jin has begun five weeks' training at a bootcamp near the North Korean border. 
After this, he will reportedly be assigned to a frontline unit. This news sent his millions of adoring fans into a frenzy.
So, what can Jin expect from his time on the frontline? 
At the Yeoncheon bootcamp, where Jin has enrolled, recruits sleep on mats on the floor, in rooms with 30 people. They are taught how to handle weapons and fire live ammunition before being put through demanding wartime scenarios.
Cadets told us that the most challenging tasks they faced were being sealed in a gas chamber, to experience the effects of CS gas, and having to detonate a live grenade. 
""I was pretty nervous to hold the grenade and shocked to learn how powerful it was,"" said 22-year-old Yang Su-yeon, who completed his training at Yeoncheon last year.
""It was physically demanding, but mentally it was okay. The drill sergeants were all friendly,"" Yang said. 
After training, Jin will reportedly be stationed near the North Korean border, with a frontline unit. 
North and South Korea are separated by a 4km (2.5-mile) wide strip of land, which runs along the length of their border, known as the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Both sides are fenced off with barbed wire and heavily armed.
Yang spent his service as an out-post guard at the DMZ, with the 5th Infantry Division, which is one of the most frontline positions. He would keep watch through the night, constantly surveying the North Korean soldiers on the other side, using thermal imaging equipment.
""A few times I saw the North Korean soldiers being beaten, either kicked or slapped in the face,"" he said. 
""They had to do manual labour because they didn't have nice equipment like us to help them.""
Yang said watching the North Korean soldiers made him feel grateful for his own experience. ""When I saw what they had to do, I realised, 'Wow, I am so much more comfortable.' I would feel sorry for them.""
But BTS's Jin will have to contend with the cold winter approaching. Yang recalled days spent shovelling snow as temperatures fell below -20C. 
""When we went outside, our eyelashes would freeze,"" he said.
Yang praised the culture of his unit: ""Because we carried guns loaded with ammunition, we had to remain calm, so there was no harassment or beatings.""
Yang volunteered to be deployed as a frontline guard, as this position comes with perks, including more time off base. 
It is more likely Jin will be sent to a base set further back from the DMZ, like 26-year-old Heo Sungyoung, who spent his service with the 6th Corps Command Centre from 2018 to 2020.
For the first six months he guarded the entrance to the command centre. 
""It was so long and boring. I had nothing to do but stare at the sky,"" Heo said. From there, he was moved on to the logistics team, where he was responsible for ordering supplies such as tissues and socks.
South Korea's compulsory military service is a source of grievance for many young men, who begrudge it for taking them away from their studies, work and friends. 
For months it was rumoured that the government might allow the members of BTS to skip the service, on the basis they had already served their country by earning it billions of dollars, and it would be more beneficial to allow them to carry on doing so.
But in October, the members of BTS announced they were all planning to enlist, with Jin, as the oldest, going first. 
Even so, the reports he was being sent to the front line surprised some fans, who had assumed he would be given a less risky role.
re used to be a special unit for celebrities, where they could continue to work as entertainers and were given privileges. But there was public outcry when some were found abusing the system, by leaving their barracks more often than allowed. In 2013, the two-tier system was abolished.
""If I said it didn't feel like a waste of time, I'd be lying,"" said Yang who was stationed at the guard post. ""If I had the choice again, I wouldn't do it. I could have learnt so much more in 18 months in the real world.
""My advice to Jin is to just bide his time and pray it passes quickly.""
But Heo, from the logistics team, had better memories. Initially he said he questioned, like many men in their 20s, why he needed to be there, but ended up learning some valuable lessons.
""At school, I had only mixed with people from the same background, but in the army, everyone was so different. I realised how much bigger and more diverse the world was.""
His advice for Jin is to enjoy this experience. ""As a top star, he will not have had much opportunity to meet normal people. This will be good for him, I think.""
Online, tens of thousands of fans have already messaged Jin to offer their own advice and tell him how terribly they will miss him.
""Please take care and bring enough warm clothes and medicine,"" wrote Maliah Leah. ""I hope your colleagues treat you well. We will be waiting patiently for your comeback."""	/news/world-asia-63944860
technology	Primark website crashes as click-and-collect launched	"Primark chief executive Paul Marchant discusses the chain's new click-and-collect service
Primark's website crashed on Monday, shortly after the retailer finally launched its click-and-collect service.
It is starting a trial in 25 stores in north-west England, Yorkshire and north Wales for children's products only.
udget chain, which lost more than £1bn in sales during the pandemic when its stores had to close, has succumbed to the online shopping revolution but it is not planning deliveries.
Primark said it was aware some people had issues accessing its site.
""We're working hard to address this to ensure that everyone can access and browse the site easily,"" the company said in a statement. 
By mid-afternoon the website appeared to be back up and running for some customers.
Paul Marchant, the retailer's chief executive, said the launch of Primark's click-and-collect service was a ""milestone for us and a really important moment"".
""We're massive fans of bricks and mortar. We believe in stores and we believe in the High Street. We think click-and-collect is the right proposition,"" he told the BBC in a rare broadcast interview.  
retailer is hoping that giving customers the chance to shop online and then pick up in store will drive more customers to its shops.
During the pandemic lockdowns Primark's 190 UK stores were forced to close its doors, and it had no online operation to fall back on. 
But Mr Marchant says the High Street now seems buoyant again. 
""We feel excited about Christmas. I think we're really well set. Our stores are feeling busy.
""It's the first time for three years that customers have been able to come into the store, mask free, restriction free and really enjoy the experience of being in a Primark store.""
Last week Primark's parent group, ABF, said it would freeze prices for Primark's clothes beyond what was already planned for this winter, despite rising costs. 
As the cost-of-living crisis bites, people have been looking to save money where they can. Supermarkets have seen shoppers swapping out of brands to cheaper, own-label products, while many people have been stocking up on warm clothes to save money on heating.
Primark itself says its snuddie, or oversized hoodie, has been one of its bestsellers so far this winter. 
retailer has defied the wider gloom on the High Street and Mr Marchant says it has picked up new customers because of the cost-of-living crisis.
""I think customers are looking for better value all the time. I think at Primark, we offer them outstanding value. And I think we are attracting new customers as a consequence of that.""
Primark has also been upping its game at its biggest ""destination"" stores, like its vast Manchester city centre one, with cafes, a barber shop, a vintage concession store and pop-up space to personalise Primark products. 
""We are, I think, the new department store, because I think we offer something for everybody but done in a new and exciting way,"" Mr Marchant says.
And this now includes dipping its toe into the world of e-commerce. 
Retail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth, CEO and founder of Savvy Marketing, says Primark is simply bowing to the inevitable. 
""They've had massive highly successful physical store growth, not just in the UK and Ireland, but also across the world. However, that dependency on a store-only format has its limitations as Primark found out to their cost in the retail lockdowns during the pandemic,"" she says. 
An online presence not only allows them to reach shoppers who can't easily access a store, or don't have time to queue up so want flexibility in when and where they visit, she says click-and-collect may also become important for the hordes of Primark fans to get their hands on products quickly before they sell out. 
Given the costs of fulfilling and delivering online orders, and dealing with high levels of returns, it can be hard for retailers to make the economics of e-commerce stack up. 
""Online is a huge commercial undertaking and the logistics for a business with the size and scale of Primark are enormous. Click-and-collect is the most sensible way to run this operation, not least because it allows returns to be placed back into the store stock to help keep costs down,"" Ms Shuttleworth says.

entertainment	Asian Network turns 20: 'A safe space for British Asians'	"When BBC Asian Network went national 20 years ago today, it was described as being ""a one-stop shop for Asian communities"".
It has provided a platform for young British Asian music talents, while welcoming big-name guests such as Shah Rukh Khan, Alia Bhatt, Ranbir Kapoor and Deepika Padukone.
For many British Asians, the station has provided ""a safe space"" to go to, whether that's to listen to music or hear topical cultural issues being discussed.
""It's like the cool, safe and secure place, and almost comforting, knowing that the Asian Network is there 24/7,"" says fan Vishma Rai. 
""And I don't think you can say that about anyone, even your friends,"" she tells BBC Newsbeat.
""I'm an opinionated young woman now. And I never was that person, I was so shy as a child,"" says 27-year-old Vishma from Bristol.
She has been a listener for over 10 years and praises the station for the ""positive impact"" it's had on her through its wide-ranging discussions.
""I didn't allow myself to even have an opinion. But Asian Network showed me that's not the norm, and it opened my eyes.""
While providing a platform for discussion, the station is known for being a champion of up-and-coming British Asian music talents.
One of those who has been played on the station regularly over the years is producer and musician Naughty Boy, who says hearing artists such as Jay Sean, Rishi Rich and Bally Sagoo had a profound impact on his own career.
""It made me think that anything's possible as a British Asian artist. Before I started, these people were paving the way.
""Asian Network has played a huge part in the trajectory of my career, from the get-go.""
He says he will be ""forever grateful"" for the support he's received and hearing his music on the station is ""a feeling that will never get old"". 
Naughty Boy notes there is a power in Asian Network, ""especially when you want to crossover"".
Joy Crookes and Priya Ragu are two artists he names as starting out and being pushed by Asian Network, and they are now popular artists in the mainstream.
""A great example of how you can be championed by one particular station but then go on to take over the world."" 
And while he might be an established name now, Naughty Boy ""loves hearing and seeing new voices"". 
One of those new talents is D8, who will be performing at Asian Network Certified in Birmingham, to celebrate 20 years of the station.
""They picked up on me really quickly and started playing my stuff,"" he says. 
""They pushed my music to an audience I wouldn't have been able to myself and I would not be where I am today without them.""
He says it's a special feeling because ""it was the only radio station that my mum and my dad, my uncles, and family used to listen to"".
D8 feels Asian talent can sometimes get ""brushed under the carpet"" because of how rare it can be to see Asians in mainstream music.
""But with me, I feel I hit the jackpot with Asian Network. I was picked up and pushed into the charts.""
For Breakfast Show presenter Nikita Kanda, ""family and community"" is what comes to mind when thinking about Asian Network.
""I really do feel like I spend more time here than with my actual family. It's somewhere you can call your own, especially for us British Asians.""
Growing up, the 27-year-old listened to the likes of Noreen Khan and Bobby Friction, and says it's now surreal to call them colleagues. 
""So professionally, and personally, it's been a big part of my life.""
Rishi Sunak became the first British Asian prime minister in the UK, and Nikita says hearing news like that ""makes the first place you want to go"" be Asian Network.
""You want to hear what we're saying about it, because it's that feeling being there when you do hear news about ourselves.""
Working in the media or entertainment industry is not a typical path for Asians, Nikita says, which is why it's important for the station to ""inspire the next generation"" of presenters and artists.
Nikita started her weekend show during the Covid pandemic and says she felt the ""responsibility as a presenter because radio is an escapism"".
""If you're having a bad morning or a bad day, and you turn on the radio, you just want to hear good music, light hearted chat, just a bit of fun."" 
Vishma agrees and feels during tough times the station has acted as a connection to the Asian community.
She says it was an ""emotional support system"".
""Everyone felt like they were in jail, it affects you. In times like that you really are in a time of need to have your mood lifted."" 
""They've always got some lively tracks to play to lighten up the mood to make you feel like everything's OK,"" she adds.

politics	Rishi Sunak: I don't recognise Dominic Raab bullying claims	"Was Rishi Sunak aware of Dominic Raab complaints?
Rishi Sunak has repeatedly declined to say whether he had informal warnings about Dominic Raab's behaviour before bringing him back into the cabinet.
rime minister insisted he was not aware of any formal complaints, in an interview with the BBC's Chris Mason.
He added: ""I've been very clear that I don't recognise the characterization of Dominic's behaviour.""
It comes as fresh allegations emerged about the deputy prime minister's treatment of staff.
Mr Raab was sacked as justice secretary and deputy prime minister by former PM Liz Truss, but was reappointed to those roles by Mr Sunak following his election as leader by Tory MPs.
Guardian says it has spoken to multiple sources who claimed Mr Raab had created a ""culture of fear"" at the Ministry of Justice, and who alleged his behaviour with civil servants had been ""demeaning"" and ""very rude and aggressive"".
He is now facing separate allegations about his behaviour in his previous role as foreign secretary under Boris Johnson, between 2019 and 2021.
Lord McDonald, the former top civil servant at the Foreign Office, said many colleagues were ""scared"" to go into Mr Raab's office when he was foreign secretary.
""It was language, it was tone, he was very curt with people, "" Lord McDonald told Times Radio, ""and he did this in front of other people, people felt demeaned.""
r said he ""had several conversations"" with Mr Raab about his behaviour, but was not aware of any formal complaints about it.
""When I worked for him, Dominic Raab was not aware of the impact of his behaviour on the people working for him, and couldn't be made to see that impact. 
""Colleagues did not complain to me formally. It was kind of their professional pride to cope. But many were scared to go into his office.
""His sort of defence was that he treated everyone in the building in the same way. He was as abrasive and controlling with junior ministers and senior officials, as he was with his private secretaries."" 
He said ""that's true"" when asked whether he had ""informally"" raised the now deputy prime minister's conduct with the Propriety and Ethics Team in the Cabinet Office. 
In his interview with the BBC's political editor at the G20 summit in Bali, Mr Sunak was repeatedly asked if he had received informal warnings about Mr Raab's alleged behaviour.
He declined to say, but insisted he did not recognize the accounts of alleged bullying by his deputy.
""And I also was not - and am not - aware of any formal complaints, "" he added.
He also denied appointing Mr Raab, Sir Gavin Williamson - who has quit the cabinet over bullying allegations - and Home Secretary Suella Braverman because they had supported his bid to be Tory leader, rather than their merits as government ministers.

entertainment	Rihanna releases Lift Me Up from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever	"Rihanna has released her first solo single in six years, a song taken from the soundtrack of the forthcoming Black Panther sequel.
Lift Me Up was released on Friday after the singer teased her return to music on social media earlier this week.
g will appear in Marvel's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, which is set to be released in November.
Director Ryan Coogler said Rihanna's involvement in the project was to honour the late actor Chadwick Boseman.
""Honestly, I think it was Chad,"" he said. ""A lot of improbable things needed to happen for it to come through and Rihanna was very clear that she did that for him.""
Boseman starred in the first Black Panther film and also appeared in Da 5 Bloods, 21 Bridges and the James Brown biopic Get On Up.
He died in 2020, four years after being diagnosed with colon cancer. Last year, Boseman was posthumously nominated for an Oscar for his performance in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.
Coogler added: ""We knew [Rihanna] was at a point in her life as well where she was focusing on different things - focused on business, motherhood, which is a big theme in our film. We were holding out hope that maybe it could work out and boy did it for this song.""
Lift Me Up has been co-written by Rihanna, Coogler and Nigerian singer-songwriter Tems, who has previously worked with Drake, Justin Bieber, Future, Wizkid, Beyonce and Khalid.
g is produced and co-written by Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson, who scored the first Black Panther film as well as Creed, Venom and Tenet. 
It is downtempo but uplifting, and sees Rihanna's distinctive vocals projected over a smooth accompaniment of delicate keys and strings. The singer is accompanied by a subtle backing choir as the atmospheric song builds to its climax.
She sings: ""Lift me up, hold me down, keep me close, safe and sound / Hold me when you go to sleep, keep me in the warmth of your love when you depart, keep me safe and sound.""
Fans warmly welcomed the release of the single on social media, with many joking via a string of memes that the song was making them levitate, but others described it as a ""disappointing"" comeback and ""definitely a movie soundtrack song"".
Lift Me Up is the first solo single from Rihanna since the release of her album Anti in 2016.
Since then, she has collaborated with other artists such as PartyNextDoor and N.E.R.D., and appeared on the hugely successful Wild Thoughts alongside DJ Khaled and Bryson Tiller.
But the singer has largely stayed quiet on the music front in recent years, as she focused on expanding her fashion, lingerie, skincare and cosmetics brand Fenty, as well as recently having a baby boy with rapper A$AP Rocky.
She also appeared opposite Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett in 2018's Ocean's 8, an all-female reboot of the Ocean's 11 franchise. 
Rihanna will headline the prestigious half-time show at February's Super Bowl in Arizona, her first live performance in over five years.
Her involvement in Wakanda Forever will increase fans' anticipation for the sequel to Black Panther, which was a huge box office success and scored a best picture nomination at the Oscars.

health	Nurse strike: Cancer patient's cancelled operation dismay	"A cancer patient has complained that he was given less than 24 hours' notice that his operation was cancelled due to the nursing strike.
man, in his seventies, was due to go into Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor on Thursday and said he was told on Wednesday afternoon it was off.
He said he should have been told days earlier that it would not go ahead.
Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board apologised for the ""understandable frustration"" caused.
It comes as thousands of nurses across Wales took part in the first day of a Royal College of Nursing (RCN) industrial action over pay.
It has led to many appointments being cancelled and postponed.
In a statement three days before the strike, on 12 December, the Betsi Cadwaladr's executive director of nursing, Angela Wood, ""confirmed cancer and urgent surgery will be prioritised and the health board will continue to maximise the use of outpatient and day case facilities.""
However, the patient - who does not want to be named - told BBC Wales he was informed at 3:15pm on Wednesday that his operation was off.
He said he has since learned that all the patients on the same day list were cancelled. 
""Frankly, I fully support the nurses and the hospital secretaries who get put under a lot of pressure,"" he said.
He said management had ""given the impression that cancer services were being prioritised, protected during the strike"". 
He added that, due to concerns over the weather conditions, he had checked into a hotel near the hospital to be sure he could make his appointment.
""That money was wasted. They could have told me days ago.""
Responding to the patient's concerns, Ms Wood said: ""My colleagues and I have had extensive negotiations with the Royal College of Nursing about staffing levels ahead of today's industrial action, in order to make sure we are there for those in urgent need. 
""Some cancer and urgent surgery appointments have gone ahead as planned. 
""However, due to the number of staff available, it has been necessary to postpone some procedures. I would like to apologise to those patients for the understandable frustration and distress this will have caused, and reassure them that we will find alternative dates for their appointments as soon as possible."""	/news/uk-wales-63991944

25-year-old will be McLaren's reserve at all grands prix that do not clash with his commitments in IndyCar, where Palou races for the Ganassi team.
Palou, who won the 2021 IndyCar title, this year drove for McLaren in practice at the US Grand Prix and in two private tests.
McLaren have not said who will fill the role at other times.
In 2022, the team had access to a total of four reserve drivers.
Palou said he was ""excited"" about his new position and was looking forward to continuing his development as a driver.

""He has many notable motorsports achievements so far, particularly the 2021 IndyCar championship title, so it's brilliant to be able to expand his role in the team and we look forward to working more closely with him."" 
Earlier this year, Palou was involved in a contract dispute between McLaren and Ganassi in IndyCar, when both teams said he was under contract to them for the 2023 season.
After legal threats, and Ganassi filing a lawsuit against Palou, an agreement was reached between the parties that he would continue with Ganassi in IndyCar next season while being allowed to test for McLaren.
It is expected that Palou will switch to McLaren's IndyCar team in 2024.

technology	Elon Musk became father of twins last year, say reports	"Elon Musk's latest tweets appear to confirm reports he had twins in late 2021 with Shivon Zilis - an executive at his technology company Neuralink. 
f executive recently had a second child with on-off partner and electronic artist, Grimes.
Reports on Wednesday claimed Mr Musk had twins with 36-year-old Ms Zilis in November 2021. 
Mr Musk responded by tweeting on Thursday that he was ""doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis"".
He added that ""a collapsing birth rate is the biggest danger civilisation faces by far"", echoing his previous statements and vocal concerns about a population crisis.   
wins born to Mr Musk and Ms Zilis would be his second set, having previously fathered twins and triplets with former wife and Canadian author Justine Wilson.
He has gone on to have two children, X Æ A-Xii and Exa Dark Sideræl, with Grimes in the last two years. 
giant and business magnate has previously claimed that a declining birth rate combined with the rise of artificial intelligence could result in ""not enough people"" being in the world. 
""Far too many people are under the illusion that Earth is overpopulated, even though birth rate trends are so obviously headed to population collapse,"" Mr Musk said in a reply to his tweet. 
American media company Insider's report on Wednesday cited court documents identifying Ms Zilis and Mr Musk on a petition to change the name of a child, filed to a Texas district court in April 2022. 
reason outlined for the name change request was ""we would like the children to have their father's last name and their mother's last name as part of their middle name"". 
Ms Zilis reportedly held several roles at companies headed up by Mr Musk, including Tesla, before taking on her role as a top executive and director at Neuralink. 
rtificial intelligence and neurotechnology company was co-founded by Mr Musk in 2015.

Elon Musk is well known for running many companies. 
But his personal life is also complex. Up until now he reportedly had seven children. 
His private life hasn't always stayed private, having previously dated Amber Heard, and fathering two children with pop star Grimes. 
But generally his messy private life has been kept separate from his business pursuits.
What makes this story potentially damaging is that he worked with Shivon Zilis. He, as her ultimate boss, was also in a position of power. 
Many US companies have rules that prevent executives from having consensual relationships with employees. 
McDonald's previously ousted its chief executive in 2019 for a relationship with an employee. 
re is no suggestion that Elon Musk has broken any rules, but the story won't help his reputation with many employees at Twitter, a company he is planning to buy.
Many employees privately worry that Mr Musk's often effective but erratic business practices could destabilise the company.  "	/news/technology-62084952

business	Ethnic pay gap: MPs criticise government's 'lack of care'	"government's decision to reject mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting for firms has been criticised as ""nonsensical"" by MPs.
Conservative MP Caroline Nokes said it also showed a lack of will ""to foster a fairer and more equal society"".
She chairs a parliamentary committee which has called for pay gap rules to be extended to include race.
But the government has said it does not want to impose any new reporting burdens on business.
Companies with more than 250 employees have been required to publish their gender pay gap statistics since 2017, revealing stark differences at some firms between the amount women and men are paid per hour on average.
Earlier this year the cross-party Commons women and equalities committee called on those firms to also publish pay differences between ethnic groups in their employment.
government rejected the proposal, pointing to a report that found publishing statistics on the ethnicity pay gap ""may not"" be the ""most appropriate tool for every type of employer seeking to ensure fairness in the workplace"".
""There are significant statistical and data issues that would arise as a result of substituting a binary-protected characteristic (male or female) with a characteristic that has multiple categories,"" the government said. 
Ms Nokes condemned the government's decision, saying in a statement: ""What is lacking in this administration is not resource or know-how, but the will or care to foster a fairer and more equal society"". 
""Introducing mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting for larger businesses would set the ball rolling, reducing inequalities between different ethnic groups,"" she said.
mmittee said research suggested that addressing race inequality in the UK labour market could boost the UK economy by £24bn a year. 
Companies already reporting gender pay gap figures were ""already well resourced"" to gather data on ethnicity and pay, the committee added, noting the government was providing detailed information on how firms could publish these statistics on a voluntary basis.
Dianne Greyson, founder of the #EthnicityPayGap campaign group, told the BBC that the government's decision was ""not acceptable"".
Previously, the trade union Unison has called for mandatory ethnic pay gap reporting, saying it is ""essential to recognise the interrelation between the ethnic pay gap and career progression."" "	/news/business-61443538
technology	Cambridge University study says robots may help children open up	"Robots could help identify mental wellbeing issues in children, a study has suggested.
Cambridge University researchers used a child-sized humanoid robot to complete a series of mental health questionnaires with 28 children aged between eight and 13.
found some children were more willing to confide in the robot than in person or in an online questionnaire.
researchers said they hoped to expand their study further.
re presenting the results at a conference in Italy.
Micol Spitale, one of the authors of the study, said they did not have any intention of replacing psychologists or other mental health professionals with robots ""since their expertise far surpasses anything a robot can do"".
But, their research suggested robots ""could be a useful tool in helping children to open up and share things they might not be comfortable sharing at first"", she said.
During the study, each child took part in a one-to-one, 45-minute session with a Nao robot - a humanoid robot about 60cm (24in) tall.
A parent or guardian, as well as members of the research team, observed from an adjacent room.
Before each session, the children and their parent or guardian completed standard online questionnaires to assess the child's mental wellbeing.
Participants then interacted with the robot by speaking with it, or by touching sensors on the robot's hands and feet.
Additional sensors tracked participants' heartbeat, head and eye movements during the session.
research team said all of the participants had told them they enjoyed talking to the robots, and some shared information which they had not shared either in person or in the online questionnaire.
""Since the robot we use is child-sized, and completely non-threatening, children might see the robot as a confidante - they feel like they won't get into trouble if they share secrets with it,"" said PhD student Nida Itrat Abbasi.
results are being presented at the 31st Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication in Naples.

technology	Facebook: Meta fined €265m by Irish Data Protection Commission	"Meta, the company which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has been fined €265m (£228m) by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC). 
fine is over a data breach that saw the personal details of hundreds of millions of Facebook users published online.
Phone numbers and email addresses of up to 533m users appeared on an online hacking forum.
DPC launched an investigation in April 2021.
Facebook said at the time that the information, some of which had already appeared online a number of years ago, was ""scraped"", but not hacked, by malicious actors through a vulnerability in its tools prior to September 2019.
""Scraping"" uses automated software to lift public information from the internet that can then end up being distributed in online forums.
However, the DPC found that Meta was in breach of Article 25 of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules.
""Because this data set was so large, because there had been previous instances of scraping on the platform, where the issues could have been identified in a more timely way, we ultimately imposed a significant sanction,"" Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon said.
""The risks are considerable for individuals in terms of scamming, spamming, smishing, phishing and loss of control over their personal data so we imposed a fine of €265m in total."" 
As well as the fine, Meta has been issued with a reprimand and an order requiring it to bring its processing into compliance by taking a range of specified remedial actions within a particular timeframe.
A spokesman for the company said: ""Protecting the privacy and security of people's data is fundamental to how our business works. That's why we have cooperated fully with the Irish Data Protection Commission on this important issue. 
""We made changes to our systems during the time in question, including removing the ability to scrape our features in this way using phone numbers. 
""Unauthorised data scraping is unacceptable and against our rules and we will continue working with our peers on this industry challenge. We are reviewing this decision carefully."" 
In September, Meta lodged an appeal in the High Court against a record fine of €405m imposed on Instagram by the DPC.
It was the largest fine ever handed down by the Irish data watchdog and was issued for breaches relating to the processing of children's data."	/news/world-europe-63786893
politics	Higher earners in Scotland to pay more income tax	"John Swinney explains why he is asking higher earners to pay more in tax
Everyone earning more than £43,662 in Scotland will have to pay more income tax next year.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the higher rate of tax will increase from 41p to 42p in the pound in April, and the top rate from 46p to 47p.
x threshold for the top rate will also be lowered from £150,000 to £125,140.
ge has already been announced for other parts of the UK by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt.
Mr Swinney described the increase as an ""extra penny to enable spending on patient care in our National Health Service"".
And he said he was asking people to ""pay their fair share"" so they could ""help to create the fairer society in which we all want to live"". 
But the Scottish Conservatives said making higher and middle earners in Scotland pay more more tax than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK risked undermining the country's potential for economic growth.
Scottish Labour said the extra money would be used to ""fix some of the damage done by 15 years of SNP cuts and failure"" and predicted that people will not accept rising tax bills ""if all they see is further decline in services"".
Mr Swinney had been due to deliver his budget statement at 14:30 - but Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone suspended the session for 30 minutes so she could investigate how details of the tax rises had been revealed by the BBC two hours earlier. 
Ms Johnstone later allowed Mr Swinney to speak after receiving ""categoric assurance"" from him and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon that the information had not been shared by the government. 
Income tax rates in Scotland, as well as several other taxes, are set by the Scottish government rather than at Westminster.
About 500,000 people in Scotland are in the higher rate bracket while a further 33,000 pay the top rate of income tax, according to the government. 
reshold for the 41p higher rate will remain frozen at £43,663 in Scotland - lower than the £50,271 elsewhere in the UK.
And there will be no changes to the rate paid by lower earners, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon previously saying this would be counterproductive in a cost of living crisis. 
residing officer suspended parliament to investigate how details of the tax rises were given to the BBC in advance of the budget statement
ges mean that everyone earning more than that threshold will pay more income tax than they did last year, and more than people earning the same salary elsewhere in the UK.
reases are a significant departure from the SNP's manifesto aim not to alter income tax rates for the duration of this parliament.
Mr Swinney said that the changes will raise a total of £553m next year when taken alongside changes to other taxes including Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) - the Scottish equivalent of stamp duty. 
mes tax part of LBTT will rise from 4% to 6%.
uty first minister also confirmed an extra £550m for local government next year. Local authorities had been asking for much more, but will be given full flexibility to set their own council tax rates.
Mr Swinney said councils should ""consider carefully the cost pressures facing the public"" when deciding the rate they will charge people.
Scottish Child Payment will remain at the increased level of £25 per child per week, with all other social security benefits under the control of the Scottish government being increased by the rate of inflation in September of 10.1%. 
r had already confirmed that benefits and pensions paid by the UK government would also rise by that figure.
Spending on health and social care in Scotland will increase by £1bn, Mr Swinney said.
And funding of £20m that had been set aside for a referendum on Scottish independence will instead be used to help people at risk of fuel poverty.
Supreme Court recently ruled that the Scottish government does not have the power to hold a vote without the formal consent of Westminster.
Meanwhile, the basic rate of business rates, which is also called the poundage, will be frozen at 49.8p. The intermediate property rate, at 51.1p, will be charged on properties with a rateable value of between £51,001 and £100,000. The threshold for the higher property rate will increase from £95,000 to £100,000.
kely to be one of the most memorable budgets in Holyrood's short history. 
Not because the statement was delayed after the BBC established some of the key details in advance. 
Instead, because of the significant tax changes it contains - with higher and top rates of income tax now two pence above the comparable rates elsewhere in the UK. 
g political choice by the Scottish government which abandons their manifesto intentions not to tinker with tax rates at all before the next election. 
Conservatives think they're making a mistake that could damage economic recovery while trades unions have welcomed the tax rises albeit they would have liked them to be higher. 
Ministers expected this criticism and suspect the political and financial pain would have been much greater if their decisions had gone the other way. 
Mr Swinney said the budget was being announced against the backdrop of the ""most turbulent economic and financial context most people can remember"".
He added: ""War is taking place in Europe, leading to the suffering and displacement of millions of Ukrainians. As a result of the conflict, energy and fuel prices are surging. Inflation is now corroding our economy having reached a 40-year high.
""If these challenges - faced by countries around the globe - were not enough, the UK has added to the turmoil by a disastrous approach to Brexit which has damaged labour supply through the loss of free movement of people and undermined frictionless trade with our nearest markets.
""All of these difficulties have been compounded by the utterly catastrophic decisions of the UK government in the September mini-budget, which have driven increases in interest rates and saddled the country with much higher debt, undermining the public finances for generations to come.""
Scottish Conservative finance spokesman Liz Smith said Mr Swinney should ""stop blaming the UK government for every single predicament"". 
And she said she was concerned about the tax differential between Scotland and the rest of the UK, which she fears could make Scotland a less attractive place to work, live and invest.
Scottish Labour finance spokesman Daniel Johnson said: ""The fact is that this money is going to have to be used to fix some of the damage done by 15 years of SNP cuts and failure.
""It is down to John Swinney to show how this money will be used to support our public services, and not to swell the ranks of spin doctors, quangos and apparatchiks."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63988944

politics	Good Friday Agreement: What is it?	"1998 Good Friday Agreement has been in the spotlight because of the UK's departure from the European Union (EU).
But what is it and how did it come about?
BBC News NI looks at the historic peace deal and the current political fall out.
Good Friday Agreement, also known as the Belfast Agreement, was a political deal designed to bring an end to 30 years of violent conflict in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles.
It was signed on 10 April 1998 and approved by public votes in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
Northern Ireland was created in 1921 and remained part of the UK when the rest of Ireland became an independent state.
reated a split in the population between unionists, who wish to see Northern Ireland stay within the UK, and nationalists, who want it to become part of the Republic of Ireland.
From the late 1960s, armed groups from both sides, such as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), carried out bombings and shootings - and British troops were sent to Northern Ireland.
roubles lasted almost 30 years and cost the lives of more than 3,500 people.
Good Friday Agreement is based on the idea of co-operation between communities.
It set up a new government for Northern Ireland, representing both nationalists and unionists. 
BBC News NI asks young people what their understanding of the Good Friday Agreement is
Westminster government gave this government control over key areas such as health and education - a process known as devolution.
A new parliament, the Northern Ireland Assembly, was set up and sits in Stormont, in Belfast.
Other parts of the agreement are about respect for people's rights, whichever part of the community they come from. 
It says:
As part of the agreement:
After Brexit, Northern Ireland became the only part of the UK to have a land border with an EU country - the Republic of Ireland.
Checks are required on goods transported between the UK and the EU's markets.
But both sides agreed this should not happen on the Irish border, to protect the Good Friday Agreement, because it was feared the cross-border co-operation could be threatened if new checkpoints were set up.
During the Troubles, people crossing the border were subject to British Army security checks - and surveillance watchtowers were placed on hilltops. 
And although the agreement does not specifically refer to the border, it does mention removing all security installations.
keep the border clear, the UK and EU agreed the Northern Ireland Protocol. Goods are checked to ensure they comply with EU rules when they arrive in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales).
Supporters of this plan, including the nationalist Sinn Féin party, say it is necessary to protect the Good Friday Agreement.
But unionist parties, including the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), say this actually undermines the agreement because it separates them from the rest of the UK.
DUP has refused to take part in power-sharing until its concerns are addressed. 
means there has been no devolved government - set up by the Good Friday Agreement - in Northern Ireland since February.
UK government has also criticised the protocol, saying it has been ""upsetting the balance of the Good Friday Agreement"".
It is trying to ditch parts of the agreement, with new legislation.
urrent stand-off with the EU, which says the protocol is the ""one and only solution"" to protecting the peace process in Northern Ireland.

But the way these contracts were awarded led to accusations of a lack of transparency and there have been court rulings against the government.
A report from the Public Accounts Committee in June 2022 found that of £12bn spent on PPE:
report said that the government is offering some of the PPE that cannot be used by the NHS to other organisations and countries, but that it was also planning to burn ""significant volumes"" to generate power.
Usually, when the government needs to buy something, it must start a ""competitive tendering process"".
A department will publish specifications of what it wants. Companies are encouraged to bid by stating the price at which they could offer it and details such as the quality of the product.
government checks the companies will be able to provide it and signs a contract with the one offering the best value for money.
rocess can take anything from a few months to a few years depending on the requirements (whether it is, say, a laptop or a submarine).
government has pre-approved suppliers and sometimes only these will be allowed to bid. 
By law, the government is required to publish a ""contract award notice"" within 30 days of signing any contracts for public goods or services worth more than £120,000. It is also required to publish the details of every contract worth over £10,000.
rules allow the government to go directly to a preferred supplier without any competition - a ""direct award"". 
It is allowed if there is only one possible supplier or in cases of ""extreme urgency"" - where there is a risk to life, for example.
According to a report published by the National Audit Office (NAO), between March and July 2020, new contracts worth £17.3bn were awarded to suppliers:
government is still obliged to publish details of large contracts if they're issued by direct award. 
Good Law Project took legal action against Michael Gove for the Cabinet Office's decision to use market research agency Public First and questioned the involvement of the prime minister's former adviser Dominic Cummings.
High Court ruled that the awarding of a £560,000 contract to the company - run by their former colleagues - without considering other firms, could be seen as suggesting a ""real danger"" of bias.
But that was overturned by the Court of Appeal, which ruled that failing to run a comparative exercise did not necessarily mean the decision-maker was biased.
In another case, it was the failure to publish details of contracts within the required 30 days that led the judge to rule that the then health secretary, Matt Hancock had acted unlawfully.
ublic had a right to know where the ""vast"" amounts spent had gone and how contracts were awarded, the judge said.
Good Law Project points out that the government published the details of 40 PPE contracts worth £4.2bn in June 2021, which were awarded a year before, despite having said in February 2021 that all the details of PPE contracts had already been published.
In documents seen by the BBC, government lawyers admitted on 25 February 2021 that 100 contracts for suppliers and services relating to Covid-19 (signed before 7 October 2020) had yet to be published. Three days earlier, the then prime minister Boris Johnson had told MPs that the contracts were ""on the record for everyone to see"". 
Between the start of the pandemic and 30 May 2021, the Department of Health distributed more than 11.7 billion items of PPE.
But there have been problems with orders, as the BBC has been reporting throughout the pandemic:
BBC also discovered that millions of medical gowns were never used, having been bought from a company called PPE Medpro for the NHS at the end of the first lockdown for £122m.
Labour criticised the government for awarding contracts to the company, which had previously been linked to Conservative member of the House of Lords Michelle Mone.
She has previously told the BBC through her lawyers that she never had any role or function in the company, or in the process by which contracts were awarded.
Baroness Mone is being investigated by the House of Lords Standards Commissioner in connection to PPE Medpro. On 6 December, her office announced that she is ""taking a leave of absence from the House of Lords in order to clear her name of the allegations that have been unjustly levelled against her"". 
In order to help the government choose between the huge numbers of offers it was getting, it introduced a ""high-priority"" or VIP lane on 2 April 2020.
was to treat offers of PPE with greater urgency if they came from a supplier recommended by ministers, government officials or MPs and members of the House of Lords, from any party.
NAO report found that up to the end of July 2020, about one in 10 suppliers who had been put in the high-priority lane were awarded government contracts, while the figure was less than one in 100 for other suppliers, outside the lane.
A problem was that the Cabinet Office, which led the process, was allegedly ""not entirely upfront about how it was done"", according to Tom Sasse from the Institute for Government.
""The Cabinet Office did not manage to keep a proper account of who recommended a particular supplier, which opens it up to accusations of cronyism.""
A government spokesperson told Reality Check: ""Proper due diligence is carried out for all government contacts and we take these checks extremely seriously.
In November 2021, the Good Law Project used a Freedom of Information request to get a list of 50 companies that had been on the VIP lane, together with the people who had referred them.
Of the 20 that had been referred by politicians, all were Conservative members of the House of Commons or the House of Lords. Five of them involved Mr Hancock.
In January 2022, the High Court ruled that the use of the VIP lane had been unlawful, following a legal challenge over the awarding of PPE contracts to two companies.
But the High Court also ruled that the companies were ""very likely"" to have been awarded contracts anyway.

health	O'Brien urology inquiry: Swab 'left inside patient for months'	"A consultant urologist left a 6.5cm swab in a patient after surgery and failed to identify it in a scan three months later, an inquiry has heard.
ublic inquiry concerns the work of Aidan O'Brien at the Southern Trust between January 2019 and June 2020.
It heard Mr O'Brien endangered or potentially endangered lives by failing to review medical scans.
He previously claimed the trust provided an ""unsafe"" service and was trying to shift blame on to its medics.
On Tuesday, the inquiry into Mr O'Brien's clinical practice heard almost 600 patients received ""suboptimal care"".
Counsel for the inquiry Martin Wolfe KC said the 6.5cm swab was left inside a patient by Mr O'Brien during a bladder tumour operation in July 2009.
rror was described as a ""never event - in other words, one that should never happen"".
At a CT scan appointment three months later in October 2009, a mass inside the patient's body was discovered by the reporting consultant radiologist.
While he did not say it was a swab, he did ""highlight the abnormality"", said Mr Wolfe. 
A report was sent to Mr O'Brien but, the Inquiry heard, he did not read it and no one took steps to check out the abnormality.  
On top of this, the Inquiry was told, a four-month review never took place due to waiting list issues.
A&E on 6 July 2010 after suffering from abdominal pain for two weeks.
mergency surgery when the swab was found and removed. 
Following an investigation into the incident, a directive was issued by the trust to all consultants that scan results should be reviewed as soon as available. 
But Mr Wolfe said Mr O'Brien later challenged a trust manager on the directive and did not appear to comply with it.
By failing to review scans, Mr O'Brien's patients were ""endangered or potentially endangered"", Mr Wolfe said.
Mr Wolfe told the inquiry of a number of incidents where Mr O'Brien had not reviewed follow-up scans.
In another case, a patient's scan identified a cancerous tumour but Mr O'Brien did not respond to an email from the radiologist highlighting this.
It was also not followed up by the radiology department to its cancer tracker team, meaning the patient did not receive treatment at an earlier stage.
Mr Wolfe said a review of this case recommended a system in which consultants would have to electronically sign off receipts of such emails. 
Mr O'Brien worked at the Southern Health Trust from 1992 until his retirement in July 2020.
He was temporarily excluded from the workplace in 2017 before returning under supervision.
quiry was told the trust had questions to answer over why Mr O'Brien's work was seemingly left unchecked.
""It is unclear how this was resolved, if at all, and it is the kind of governance issue the inquiry will want to discuss at these hearings,"" Mr Wolfe said.
""It does not appear that the trust implemented any form of monitoring of Mr O'Brien's management of patients' results and whether he ever complied is unclear, but subsequent actions indicate he may not have done so.""
Summing up, Mr Wolfe laid out the issues for the inquiry to explore in light of practices which endangered patients lives at Craigavon Area Hospital.
ues Mr Wolfe recommended be explored in questioning are:

business	Tesco and Heinz reach agreement in price row	"Heinz have reached an agreement which will see some of the UK's best known products back on the supermarket chain's shelves in the coming days.
Heinz beans and tomato ketchup were among the products that had disappeared from Tesco's shelves in a pricing row.
whether those products would be going up in price due to the new agreement.
row reflects pressures on firms and suppliers as the cost of living soars.
ute between Tesco and Kraft Heinz began at the end of June after the US giant tried to boost the prices it was charging the UK's largest supermarket.
Kraft Heinz said at the time it was becoming more expensive to make its products.
Baked beans, ketchup and tomato soup were among the staples that went missing from shelves in some Tesco stores after Heinz stopped supplying the retailer.
But Tesco said on Friday that it had ""reached an agreement that will see the full range of Heinz products return to Tesco shelves and online"".
""Lorries full of Heinz products including Heinz Tomato Ketchup and Heinz Beanz will hit the road shortly, and Tesco colleagues will be working hard to ensure shelves are filled again over the coming days,"" Tesco said in a statement. ""It's great to be back together.""
Last month, the Daily Telegraph reported that Heinz had wanted to charge 30% more to supply some products.
A Tesco spokesperson declined to say on Friday how a deal had been agreed, and whether it would mean higher prices for customers.
Food manufacturers have reported rising costs in recent months, including for energy and commodities, with some warning that they would need to raise the prices they charge to retailers.
As well as Heinz, Tesco also fell out with Mars in a row over prices. This row - which is as yet unresolved - has led to the US food giant halting supplies of Whiskas pet food to the supermarket chain.
Ged Futter, who used to be an Asda executive and is now a director at consultancy The Retail Mind, said it was very likely that Tesco would have agreed to the price rises that Heinz wanted.
""[Tesco] has to have those products on its shelves,"" he said, because Heinz products are available from so many other retailers.
He said Tesco was ""just encouraging shoppers to shop elsewhere"" by not having those products at a time when many customers were being squeezed by prices going up quickly.
Mr Futter added that Mars was potentially in an even stronger bargaining position than Kraft Heinz, partly because the amount of pet food it sells to Tesco is only a very small part of its business.
All food manufacturers are facing extreme price pressures, he said, with ""literally everything"" becoming more expensive.
""Packaging, cans, plastic for bottles, cardboard, paper for labels - all going up. All ingredients: food, fertiliser, and fuel - all going up.""
r, the price of fertiliser has increased from £150 per tonne to £1,000 per tonne, he said.
It is not just big suppliers who are passing on costs - medium-sized and small firms are too, Mr Futter added.
""If they supply at the previous cost they will go bust."""	/news/business-62076208
entertainment	Tom Owen: Last of the Summer Wine star dies at 73	"Last Of The Summer Wine actor Tom Owen has died at the age of 73, his family has confirmed.
Owen played Tom Simmonite, the long lost son of Compo - who was played by the actor's real-life father Bill Owen.
madic character featured in the long-running BBC sitcom for 10 years, throughout the noughties.
m Owen also appeared in other TV shows like The Bill, The Onedin Line and Upstairs Downstairs, as well as the 2018 film The Bromley Boys.
""He passed away peacefully and is survived by his two children, James and William, and ex-wife, Mary,"" his family said in a statement.
Owen began is career as an assistant stage manager at Leatherhead Theatre in Surrey, before moving on to Westminster Theatre. After a stint working in TV he returned to work and direct in the theatre, in Sidmouth, Devon.
He was chosen to play Compo's son just days after the death of his father in 1999 from cancer.
""It was two or three days after Dad had died,"" he recalled in 2000, of the surprise phone call from the show's producer, Alan Bell.
""Obviously my mind was on other things, like organising the funeral, and it hadn't occurred to me at all that I would be approached to play Compo's long-lost son.
""Alan suggested the idea to me and I thought about it for two seconds before saying yes.""
He continued: ""At first when I arrived on set it was very odd.
""It was emotional, but very early on I decided the only way I could tackle it was by being a professional.""
Owen went on to say, in the same interview, he had been ""very aware"" of how ""wary"" the other cast members might have been of him. ""They had all been through a traumatic shock when Dad died,"" he added. ""They had known him for all those years as well.
""Dad loved the show and I think he would be very proud that it is going to continue, and in a way it's continuing in his memory. I think he would be very happy that I've taken his place.""
Set in the Yorkshire village of Holmfirth, Last of the Summer Wine was an affectionate comedy, written by Roy Clarke, about people in the autumn of their years.
It was the world's longest-running sitcom, having clocked up over 30 series as well as several Christmas specials.

health	NI health: Northern Ireland is 'getting the health service we pay for'	"People in Northern Ireland are getting ""the health service we pay for"", the Department of Health's top civil servant Peter May has said.
He warned that without sustained investment people must ""recalibrate"" their expectations on service delivery.
rmanent secretary said fundamental questions must be addressed on the health service's future.
It comes as the Royal College of Nursing confirmed its plans to take strike action before Christmas.
On Friday, the trade union said its members in Northern Ireland, England and Wales would walk out on 15 and 20 December in a dispute about pay and staffing levels.
Mr May told the annual conference of the Northern Ireland Branch of the Healthcare Financial Management Association in Belfast it was getting harder to deliver what people needed.
""With the resources available to us, we are finding it increasingly difficult to deliver the health and social care system needed to meet all the demands of the population,"" he said.
""We all want to get back to a health service that provides timely care to everyone who needs it when they need it.
""That's far from guaranteed. Without sustained funding, it will be impossible,"" he continued.
Mr May told delegates that while ""many actions"" could be taken to ""make health and social care more efficient and effective….we must not pretend that efficiencies alone will close the widening gap between demand and supply.""
Mr May added: ""The reality is also that our ageing population and advances in medical science mean the gap between demand and capacity is growing year-on-year, winter-on-winter.""
r civil servant also told the conference ""it remains the case that the overwhelming majority of the most sick patients receive very high quality care.""
""At the same time, many people requiring less time-critical care are having to wait much longer - often in pain and discomfort. This is not the level of care that the public expects or that any of us wants to provide.""
He also told stressed to delegates the ""importance of not losing hope in face of the current challenges"".
Revealing details about its strike action, Pat Cullen, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said nursing staff ""had enough of being taken for granted, enough of low pay and unsafe staffing levels, enough of not being able to give our patients the care they deserve"".
Under trade union laws, the union has to ensure life-preserving care is provided during the strikes, which will last from 08:00 to 20:00 GMT."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63760682
technology	The DIY gadgets that could keep your energy bill down	"Hidden in an attic in Chester, a tiny computer constantly downloads local weather data from the internet and uses it to save a homeowner money. 
gadget, no more than a handful of circuit boards and wiring in a small plastic case, is connected to a gas boiler. When it's warm outside, it turns the boiler flow temperature down as less energy is needed to heat the building. This is known as weather compensation.
""It's been running for about eight months now and it works perfectly,"" says Paul Pschierer-Barnfather, who built and installed the device himself. ""I should have done this years ago.""
re are branded products that work in a similar way, or which measure the outside air temperature directly and adjust the temperature of water sent to radiators accordingly.
But Mr Pschierer-Barnfather, who works for an electric car charging firm and has some technical know-how, says making the device himself cost only about £15.
It's a job that is probably best undertaken by someone who knows what they are doing.
Other techies have come up with gadgets and apps to help them reduce their bills and, given the soaring cost of energy at the moment, many are keen to share their experiences in the hope that they will benefit others.
Mr Pschierer-Barnfather's project began after he read about how lowering the flow temperature on a condensing gas combi boiler can improve its efficiency. 
flow temperature is the temperature to which a combi heats the water before it circulates among radiators. Lower flow temperatures mean more hot water vapour condenses within the boiler as it operates, which retains heat.
""When I started turning the boiler down, it probably cut the gas consumption by about 10%,"" says Mr Pschierer-Barnfather. 
He found that on very cold days he felt he had to turn the boiler back up again slightly, however, and that's when he decided to make a gadget to do this automatically. 
keeps the radiator flow temperature between 30C and 50C, which he finds is sufficient. 
fferent from altering the thermostat temperature and it is important to note that adjustments like this only apply to the radiator flow temperature on condensing gas combi boilers with separate hot water controls. Lowering the hot water temperature too much can allow the growth of bacteria, including legionella.
In the Midlands, programmer Tomás McGuinness has designed a different gizmo that uses sensors to read the flow temperatures on his boiler. It sends a notification to a smartphone app if the return flow rises above 55C, the approximate point at which the boiler would stop condensing. He can then fine-tune the temperature manually.
""My little sensor system, I could probably put it together for about a tenner,"" he says. Via Twitter, he's found several people who are willing to try prototypes of his device, which he says he might go on to produce for sale.
r measures, such as reducing his boiler's power consumption and insulating his home, have helped him take control of his energy expenditure, he adds.
However, Mr McGuinness says he is still concerned about the continuing rise in bills. 
Mr Pschierer-Barnfather agrees, adding that he feels ""lucky"" to have the skills required to reduce his gas bill slightly. He argues that fellow techies are in a position to help others shield themselves from energy price rises.
""For people who haven't got double glazing or haven't been able to do what I have with their boiler, they're going to get the full whack of this.
""We can help. We're a slightly geeky minority… I feel that there's more that we can do.""
More efficient boilers should be the norm, he says. 
Some installers don't set boilers up to run as efficiently as they could, or explain things such as condensing and flow temperature to homeowners, says Jo Alsop, founder of independent consumer advice organisation The Heating Hub.
However, based on enquiries to The Heating Hub, people do seem to be increasingly interested in finding out how to maximise the efficiency of their home energy systems, she adds.
A spokesman for Home Assistant, a software tool for controlling smart home tech, tells the BBC that he has also noticed a rise in queries about setting up energy management systems.
More technology of business:
Many people also monitor their home electricity demand closely. Glyn Hudson, co-founder of OpenEnergyMonitor, says it is possible to simply and safely attach a sensor to the cables exiting your electricity board and track energy consumption over time.
Dan Medhurst, who lives near Reading and who works in IT, has attached a sensor to the front of his electricity meter. It tracks the pulsing LED on the meter, which reveals how much power is flowing. The data is sent wirelessly to Home Assistant and he can check it at any time on his smartphone or computer.
It means Mr Medhurst can spot spikes in usage and, based on the time they occurred, can work out what appliances caused them. It made him realise just how much electricity his tumble dryer consumes, for example, and he also decided to turn his fridge temperature up, while still keeping the contents cold enough (5C or below).
recent example was the TV, however, he adds.
""I had the brightness and contrast turned up quite high… Just by turning it to eco mode the usage dropped from 100 watts down to 50 watts.""
result of closer monitoring and more careful use of his appliances has resulted in a greater than 10% drop in his electricity bill, he estimates, though he adds that the continuing price rises remain daunting.
Although small adjustments to home energy use will not eliminate the pain of rapidly rising bills, there is still value in it, especially when thousands or millions of homes get involved, says Abigail Dombey, chair of Hydrogen Sussex, an energy industry body.
Lowering domestic gas consumption means more gas is available for gas-fired power stations, which could help avoid blackouts, she says, and at scale this could alleviate pressure on the European energy system as a whole. Plus, the less gas that is burned, the less CO2 gets emitted into the atmosphere.
""These are tiny actions that actually can make colossal differences,"" she says."	/news/business-62900202
health	Police asked to help during Welsh ambulance strike, says health minister	"Welsh government has been discussing with police whether they can help resuscitate patients during next week's ambulance staff strike.
Action over pay by the three main ambulance unions on 21 December will affect non-life threatening calls only.
But the Police Federation raised doubts about officers dealing with medical emergencies they are not qualified for. 
Wales' health minister said officials have been speaking to police about ""helping with resuscitation and so on"".
Welsh Ambulance Service will face strike action next Wednesday, along with most ambulance services in England.
Police Federation, representing officers across England and Wales, has expressed misgivings about being asked to cover the work of ambulance staff.
Federation National Chair Steve Hartshorn said on Tuesday: ""I have genuine concern for any officer who may be exposed to medical emergencies they are not qualified to act on. 
""The human consequences are awful to imagine, but we must consider the legal responsibilities and practicalities too. 
""Should a patient die in the presence of a police officer, or within a period of time of being with a police officer, that officer is referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct for investigation.""
Responding to a question from Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price in the Senedd, Eluned Morgan said: ""We have been speaking, for example, to the police, in terms of the police helping with resuscitation and so on.""
Ms Morgan said the Welsh government do not intend to use ""the armed forces unless that's truly necessary"".
She explained that would remain the position unless there was a ""serious problem in keeping the public safe"".
Mr Price said his party had ""serious concerns about using the police in this way"".
""Instead of talking to the police to ask them to fill in on strike days, the government should be talking to the health unions, to improve their pay award so that strike action can be averted.""

technology	Interpol seeks arrest of failed crypto-firm boss Do Kwon	"Interpol has asked law enforcement agencies worldwide to find and arrest Do Kwon, founder of the failed cryptocurrency Terra.
BBC Korean says a red notice has been issued for the 31-year-old, who is accused of fraud over the company's $40 billion collapse.
An arrest warrant was issued in his native South Korea earlier this month. 
Do Kwon flew to Singapore in May - before Terra crashed - but the authorities say he's no longer there.
South Korean prosecutors had asked Interpol to place him on the red notice list - a request it has now complied with - and asked the foreign ministry in Seoul to revoke his passport, saying that Do Kwon was ""on the run"".
He has denied that he is in hiding, but has not revealed his whereabouts.
Prosecutors have also issued arrest warrants for five other people - who have not been named - linked to the so-called stablecoin Terra and its sister token Luna.
Stablecoins are designed to have a relatively fixed price and are usually pegged to a real-world commodity or currency - but Terra's value collapsed during this year's wider cryptocurrency crash.
rra Luna system collapsed in May, with the price of both tokens plummeting to near zero, and the fallout hitting the wider crypto-market. 
From a $116 high in April, a Terra coin is now worth less than $0.0002.
Globally, investors in the two coins lost an estimated $42 billion, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.
Some investors lost their life savings, and South Korean authorities have opened several criminal probes into the crash."	/news/technology-63033262
entertainment	Batgirl to Wagatha: 15 flops and blunders in culture in 2022	"We all make mistakes in life, and generally we try to fix them, apologise and move on.
But that can be a bit more difficult if you're famous, when the silly, puzzling or inadvertently offensive thing you've done was in the glare of the public eye.
In many ways, celebrities perform a vital function, partly by providing material for the rest of us to dissect, praise, criticise and make into memes. 
But also because high-profile gaffes help us feel better about the mistakes we all make, and our celebrities seem more human and relatable as a result.
With affection rather than malice, here are 15 flops, errors, blunders, misfortunes and own goals from 2022.
1. Batgirl being cancelled
re is nowhere better to start than a $90m (£75m) film that reportedly tested so poorly with audiences that Warner Discovery canned it altogether. 
Choosing to write Batgirl down as a financial loss instead of releasing it meant the company could at least save some money on tax.
We felt sad for those who poured their hearts into the film, particularly In The Heights star Leslie Grace, who was set to take the lead role.  
But while many fans were keen or at least intrigued to see it, perhaps the company's CEO David Zaslav should be applauded for taking such a close interest in quality control. ""We're not going to put a movie out unless we believe in it,"" he explained.
2. Rebekah Vardy's libel action
wists and turns of the so-called Wagatha Christie trial provided a distraction from the war-dominated news agenda this spring, and material for numerous podcasts, documentaries, TV dramatisations and a West End show.
While Mrs Vardy felt she had a case, and the abuse she received online was horrible and shouldn't be condoned, she ended up with an estimated £3m legal bill after the judgement went against her.
Guardian described it as one of the ""all-time great self-inflicted legal defeats"".
3. Graham Norton's Eurovision card
Watch the moment Graham Norton announced the 2023 host city
In October, all eyes were on The One Show as viewers waited to find out whether Glasgow or Liverpool would be hosting Eurovision 2023.
Graham Norton was about to reveal the winning host city, building the tension with the kind of needlessly long pause that is standard when announcing anything on television. 
which would have been palpable if some viewers hadn't already spotted the words ""Eurovision Song Contest Liverpool 2023"" on the back of his card.
4. Holly and Phil not queuing
Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby attracted criticism when they visited Queen Elizabeth II lying-in-state without having to join the 20-hour public queue outside. The presenting pair were there to report on the event for ITV's This Morning.
Did the duo technically do anything wrong? Of course not. They were granted a press viewing just like hundreds of other journalists over several days. 
But the fact that they were probably the most famous of the media figures made them a target, and many were quick to juxtapose their appearance with other celebrities seen queuing outside, such as David Beckham. 
5. Miriam Margolyes being booked as a live guest
V and radio producers know Margolyes can be a liability when it comes to live broadcasting, and so it proved when she was invited to pay tribute to the late Robbie Coltrane on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
After a beautiful and eloquent reflection on Coltrane's career, Margolyes decided to end the interview by sharing her unambiguous thoughts about newly installed Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, who had been in the studio moments before her.
resenters became flustered as the sound of marmalade toast hitting the floor ricocheted across the country.
""Nobody would believe me, but I did not know the microphone was on,"" she later told the Times. ""I just died inside, I was mortified.""
6. The attempted Spotify boycott
Joni Mitchell and Neil Young were among the artists who removed their music from Spotify in January in protest at the streaming service's deal with podcast host Joe Rogan, who was accused of spreading misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines.
A ""boycott Spotify"" movement followed on social media, with users threatening to cancel their subscriptions if the streamer didn't cut ties with Rogan. But Spotify kept its ties firmly intact.
While the artists in question were taking a principled stand, the coverage arguably proved there's no such thing as bad publicity. Spotify subscriptions grew and Rogan claimed his listener base increased by two million. 
However, Rogan did announce that he would try to offer more balanced views on his podcast in the future.
7. Beyoncé and Lizzo's re-recorded lyrics
Beyoncé presumably had not been paying attention to the news when Lizzo faced a barrage of criticism for using an ableist slur in her lyrics, because Queen Bey used the same word herself in a song two months later. 
Some reports noted the offensive slur isn't considered quite as offensive in America and its usage is slightly more common as a result.
Nonetheless, it still wasn't a good look - so both stars were praised for re-recording the lines in question following the backlash.
8. Damien Hirst burning his own art
Hirst is no stranger to publicity stunts, but many criticised him for burning his own valuable artworks during a cost-of-living crisis as part of a project that saw collectors forced to choose whether to keep a physical artwork or the NFT representing it.
""It's almost like Damien Hirst is so out of touch with the real world that he's basically transcended to another plane of existence, populated only by oligarchs and the once-edgy artists they collect,"" wrote Time Out's Eddy Frankel.

Channel 4 News presenter was heard uttering an offensive word about a government minister in a live online feed which wasn't actually broadcast on TV.
However, it inevitably spread far and wide on social media and led to a week-long suspension. 
Guru-Murthy apologised within minutes of being caught, which was classy, but his suspension coincided with a Tory leadership race and meant the network's leading news anchor missed out on covering the appointment of a new prime minister.

business	Shell boss says taxing energy firms to help the poor is 'inevitable'	"xes on firms within the oil and gas industry are ""inevitable"" to help the poorest people, the outgoing boss of Shell has said.
Ben van Beurden said that energy markets cannot behave in a way that ""damage a significant part of society"".
Households in the UK have been under pressure from rising energy bills as gas prices have soared.
UK government under Liz Truss has pushed back against extending a windfall tax on oil and gas firms.
Last week, the EU agreed emergency measures to charge energy firms on record profits.
Energy prices jumped when Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year, although prices had already been rising as economies began to recover after Covid lockdowns were lifted.
Speaking to the Energy Intelligence Forum, an oil industry event, Mr van Beurden said: ""You cannot have a market that behaves in such a way - logically and effectively and everything else - that it's going to damage a significant part of society.""
He said that ""one way or another"" there would be government intervention that ""results in protecting the poorest"".
""That probably means governments need to tax people in this room to pay for it - I think we just have to accept [that] as a societal reality,"" he said.
Mr van Beurden added that taxes can be brought in ""smartly and not so smartly"".
""There is a discussion to be had about it but I think it's inevitable,"" he said.
However, governments should not intervene to cap gas prices, he added.
UK brought in a windfall tax on bumper oil and gas profits in May, but Prime Minister Liz Truss has ruled out extending it.
x - called the Energy Profits Levy - applies to profits made by companies from extracting UK oil and gas, and the Treasury expects it to raise about £5bn in its first year.
A UK Government spokesperson said: ""The government has been clear that it wants to see the oil and gas sector reinvest its profits to support the economy, jobs, and the UK's energy security.""
""We expect our Energy Profits Levy, announced in May, to raise an extra £7 billion in its first year which will help pay for the £400 energy bills discount for all households to help with energy bills from October.
""This is on top of our new Energy Price Guarantee, announced last month which will save the average household around £1,000 a year based on current energy prices from October.""
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and market analyst, Hargreaves Lansdown, said Mr van Beurden's comments had ""flung open a door on a windfall tax which the UK government had been trying to close"".
""This will reignite the debate over how profits of energy giants should be taxed, just as a row rages about whether welfare spending will be hit to pay for the Truss administration's slash and spend policies,"" she said.
rice of Brent Crude oil has fallen from $120 per barrel in May to about $90 per barrel, although these are still the highest prices since 2014.
Nevertheless, the Opec oil cartel is expected to announce a cut in output at a meeting on Wednesday, a decision which is designed to support prices.
""Such a decision would be difficult to justify fundamentally, as the oil market suffers anything but a surplus,"" said Norbert Rucker, head of economics at private banking firm Julius Baer.
""The petro-nations seem willing to exploit their power to artificially prop up oil prices, increasing the tensions with the oil consumers."""	/news/business-63084691
health	Ambulance service urges rethink before calling 999 over Christmas	"People are being urged to reconsider whether they need an ambulance, before calling 999 over Christmas.
week has seen calls to the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) up 25% on the same period in previous years. 
It is believed to be a result of recent bad weather, a rise in flue cases and limited resources from a Covid backlog.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said efforts were being made to address ambulance waiting times.
Health workers were providing help  over the phone or in their homes to help alleviate pressure on emergency departments.
Last week, one in 10 ambulances in Ayrshire and Arran waited over four hours outside an emergency department to hand over a patient. 
And the SAS recently apologised after a patient was airlifted to Glasgow Airport when no ambulance was available for a 300 yard transfer from the helipad at Crosshouse Hospital in East Ayrshire.
Chief executive of the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) Pauline Howie told BBC Scotland the service was ""extremely busy"".
""Demand over the last week has been up 25% on what we would normally expect, which is often a very, very busy time of year,"" she said. 
""We suspect that that is due to a combination of the bad weather, an increase in respiratory illnesses, and a backlog due to Covid. 
""We are trying our very best to do what we can to prioritise patients and focus our limited resources on those that have got the most time-critically unwell conditions.""
People are being asked to consider whether speaking to their GP, NHS 24 or a community pharmacist might be a better option for their condition.
Ms Howie said: ""We have also developed an integrated clinical hub here within the Scottish Ambulance Service.
""So if your condition isn't a time critical emergency, we might offer a consultation with one of our clinicians to try to find a pathway that's right for you at that time, which often is not going to the emergency department.""
She said a recruitment campaign had taken on more staff than ever before.
Ms Howie told BBC Scotland that SAS recruited 540 new ambulance workers last year and 488 this year.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the service was working to improve turnaround times.
""We'll do everything we can to give people the best possible service, but of course we know that there's far too many people waiting too long for treatment and care,"" he said.
Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland that the service was seeing a spike in respiratory viruses, with flu cases in particular.
""Given the pressures that's on the system, this is going to be the most challenging time,"" he added.
""That's going to have an impact on the staff and equally no doubt it will have an impact on the care that we're able to provide for patients."""	/news/uk-scotland-64065840
business	Jack Dorsey: Twitter co-founder breaks silence on Elon Musk takeover	"witter co-founder and ex-CEO Jack Dorsey has addressed the mass sackings at his former firm, apologising for growing Twitter ""too quickly"".
Half of the social media giant's staff are being fired, a week after Elon Musk bought it in a $44bn deal.
Billionaire Mr Musk has said he had ""no choice"" but to slash the company's workforce as the firm is losing more than $4m (£3.5m) a day.
witter staff took to the platform to express their anger at the firings. 
In a statement posted on the microblogging site, Mr Dorsey - who quit as CEO in November and left the board of directors in May - said Twitter staff ""are strong and resilient. They will always find a way no matter how difficult the moment. I realise many are angry with me. I own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation: I grew the company size too quickly. I apologise for that.""
""I am grateful for, and love, everyone who has ever worked on Twitter. I don't expect that to be mutual in this moment...or ever…and I understand,"" he added. 
His statement appeared to endorse the need for dismissals at the firm. The 45-year-old Mr Dorsey has been supportive of Mr Musk's takeover.
Back in April when Mr Musk first began his purchase of Twitter, Mr Dorsey said the 51-year-old was the ""singular solution I trust"" and that the South African's takeover was ""the right path...I believe it with all my heart"".
Mr Dorsey created Twitter in 2006 along with Evan Williams, Biz Stone, and Noah Glass. He sent the company's first Tweet, writing ""just setting up my twttr"". 
uts have come across Twitter's 7,500-strong work force, and there are fears it could damage the firm's content moderation efforts. 
Despite the dismissals Mr Musk has said the firm's policies remain ""absolutely unchanged"".
A host of major brands have halted advertising spending with Twitter in recent days, including Volkswagen, General Motors and Pfizer.
Almost all of Twitter's revenue currently comes from advertising, and Mr Musk has been looking for ways to cut costs and make money in different ways from the platform.
In a move much publicised in advance, Twitter launched a subscription service on Saturday allowing users to buy blue-tick verification on the platform for a monthly fee of $7.99 (£7)."	/news/technology-63527893
technology	Nearly a quarter of Earth's seafloor now mapped	"Slowly but surely the proportion of the global ocean floor that's been properly mapped is rising.
It's now up to just shy of a quarter of the total area under water - at 23.4%.
Better seafloor maps help us with navigation and conservation, among many other uses.
Some 10 million sq km (3.8 million sq miles) of new bathymetric (depth) data was added in the past year. This is an area broadly equivalent to the land surface of Europe.
update was given at the second UN Ocean Conference, taking place this week in Lisbon, Portugal.
Much of this additional data comes not from recent mapping efforts, however, but simply as a result of governments, institutions and companies agreeing to open up their archives. 
It's thought a further 10-15% is still squirrelled away on servers, in part because the owners worry they might be giving away commercial or defence secrets if they release the information.
""But they really needn't worry,"" said Jamie McMichael-Phillips, director of Seabed 2030, the organisation that is trying to corral world efforts to obtain a complete picture of Earth's ocean bottom.
""One of the messages we're trying to get across is that we don't require high-resolution data. Hi-res is nice; we can work with it. But lower resolution is perfectly acceptable. 
""One depth value in an area the size of a European football pitch, 100m by 100m or thereabouts, isn't going to give away national or commercial secrets.""
knowledge is needed for a host of reasons.
Sea maps are essential for safe navigation, obviously, but also for fisheries management and conservation. Marine wildlife tends to congregate around the underwater mountains. Each seamount is a biodiversity hotspot.
In addition, the rugged seafloor influences the behaviour of ocean currents and the vertical mixing of water. This is information required to improve the models that forecast future climate change - because it is the oceans that play a pivotal role in moving heat around the planet.
At the moment, our knowledge of just over three-quarters of the planet's underwater terrain comes only from low-resolution satellite measurements that have inferred the presence of tall seamounts and deep valleys from the gravitational influence these features have on the sea surface. Water piles up over the mass of a large submarine mountain and dips slightly where there is a trench.
It's super smart but an underwater mountain that's hundreds of metres tall can still fail to show up in such observations. 
UK's new polar ship, the RRS Sir David Attenborough, is equipped to map millions of sq km of ocean bottom over its career. The above image shows the ship's hull in dry dock. The yellow rectangle in the centre is a cover made of a synthetic material over the 8m-long array of transmitting transducers for the deep-water multibeam echosounding system. 
Seabed 2030, which is funded by Japan's Nippon Foundation, is encouraging anyone who ventures away from the land to switch on their sonar equipment and take depth soundings. And this isn't just about measurements from big ships; small ocean-going yachts fitted with data loggers can also make a contribution.
One of Seabed 2030's stars is the American adventurer Victor Vescovo. The Texan financier is using a submersible to visit the deepest places in the world's oceans, but everywhere he goes his support ship switches on its echosounder.
""We have a 'map the gap' strategy,"" Mr Vescovo told BBC News.
""We're not a commercial outfit so we don't have to follow the most fuel-efficient routes. When we go on an expedition we ask [Seabed 2030], 'what are your priority areas?'; and we divert a little bit to cover those areas."" 
former US Navy reservist has himself contributed over 3 million sq km.
It's clear, however, that to come close to obtaining a full picture of the shape of Earth's ocean bottom, there will need to be a step change in approach and capability. Many parts of the world are so remote, few ships will visit them, let alone acquire depth data in those regions. 
map these places is going to require direct tasking of autonomous or semi-autonomous technologies.
re is a glimpse of how this will work in one line of data featured in the map at the top of this page. It was gathered by the Saildrone Surveyor on a cruise between San Francisco and Honolulu last year.
During this 28-day voyage, the robot boat mapped 22,000 sq km of seafloor. 
Saildrone Surveyor is 22m in length. But truly huge autonomous vessels are coming.
marine robotics company Ocean Infinity is currently building a fleet of 78m-long ships in Vietnam. Regulations will probably mean they have to be lean-crewed for the near future, but the goal eventually is to have them roving the ocean without anyone onboard. Their work would be overseen from satellite-linked control centres in the UK, the US and a third location somewhere in Asia.
Such ships could be sent out on long missions to map hard to reach areas at much lower cost than would be incurred by a conventional crewed vessel.
Progress to full mapping of the seafloor was discussed in a side meeting at this week's UN Ocean Conference. And while the participants recognised new technologies were essential to fulfilling the quest, Dr Lucy Woodall cautioned that the 2030 project would fail unless it engaged all communities with an interest in the data. 
She cited examples of companies going into coastal areas to map the seafloor and then not sharing any of the information with the local people whose livelihoods depended on those waters.
""I would argue to those of you in the room who think technology has got to be the way - I would argue that, actually, people are the way because unless people are asking the questions, unless we have a dialogue with all the voices in the room, then we're not going to ask, and therefore we can't answer, those right questions,"" the chief scientist with Nekton, a UK-based oceans NGO, told the meeting."	/news/science-environment-61986359
health	Morpeth: East Ridings Care Home rated inadequate by inspectors	"A residential care home looking after 67 people, some with dementia, has been rated inadequate by inspectors.
Care Quality Commission (CQC) found broken washing machines at East Riding Care Home in Morpeth led to residents having to wear other people's clothes and sleeping in ""dirty bed sheets"".
Faults were also found in safeguarding, staff recruitment and infection risks not being properly managed.
me said it had ""taken a number of steps"" to rectify the failings.
A spokesperson for Four Seasons, which runs the home, said the ""safety and wellbeing of residents remains our first priority"" and that it regretted falling below expected standards.
It added a review of ""resident care and medication processes"" had been carried out and that a new washing machine had been installed.
CQC found ""the standard of care had deteriorated"" since its last inspection and has placed it in special measures for improvements to be carried out.
CQC head of inspection Alison Chilton said: ""Both of the home's washing machines had broken which had resulted in a large build-up of soiled laundry. The quantity and how it was stored increased the risk of infections being passed on to people and staff.
""Additionally, this resulted in some people not having enough clean clothes and having to wear other people's. Also, staff told us they weren't always able to change bedding as often due to the shortage of clean sheets, so people were living with dirty bed sheets which is totally unacceptable.""
Inspectors found appropriate checks were not carried out on 19 out of 28 agency workers at the home, there were inaccuracies and omissions with the administration and recording of medicines, and safeguarding systems were not ""robust enough"" to ensure people were protected from the risk of abuse.
It did find residents were supported with communication needs, end-of-life care plans were in place and visitors were supported to see their relatives in the home, with some telling inspectors staff had ""caring attitudes"".
A new home manager, activities coordinator and activities assistant have been appointed by Four Seasons at East Riding since the inspection.

technology	Ukraine sent dozens of 'dronations' to build army of drones	"Dozens of people have given their hobby and commercial drones to Ukraine after it appealed for ""dronations"" to help build its ""army of drones"".
untry is also asking for money to buy 200 military reconnaissance drones.
Ukrainian and Russian forces have used small consumer drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), in the war.
But Justin Bronk, of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), says while small drones are useful, tactics are adapting to counter them.
Small and commercial drones can provide a live view of the enemy's positions, he says.
""Both sides in Ukraine have been able to very rapidly exploit that real-time video picture, to call down artillery fire and quickly correct it so that it's very, very accurate, even when using old school unguided artillery, on to enemy forces,"" he said.
But he warned electronic counter-measures were becoming increasingly effective.
roposed army of drones is a complex programme involving procurement, maintenance and replacement, as well as pilot training, Ukraine says.
Col Oleksii Noskov, assistant commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, said: ""The army of drones will allow us to constantly monitor the 2,470km-long (1,535 miles) front line and to field an effective response to enemy attacks, using modern technology.""
Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, told the BBC via email that the first goal of the campaign was to purchase tactical drones which have a 100-mile range and are equipped with a sophisticated camera, GPS and mapping tools.
However, after studying the issue, he said ""our team understood that Ukraine's army still needed quadcopters"", and so he said the country was asking people to ""donate their own drones"".
Ukraine hopes to collect thousands of multi-use and commercial UAVs.
Drones which meet the minimum standards are being donated to Ukraine via two warehouses, one in Poland and the other in the US.
Mr Fedorov also wants companies to get involved, adding: ""This project is a great opportunity for drone manufacturers to test their equipment in harsh conditions.""
mpaign, which was launched on Friday, has already raised £5.7m, enabling the purchase of two military UAVs. Dozens of small drones had also been received, Mr Fedorov tweeted.
military ""warmate"" drones, according to Mr Bronk, are a type of loitering munition manufactured in Poland. According to the company's website, the drone ""constitutes a good alternative for anti-tank guided missiles"".
According to Mr Fedorov, hobby and commercial drones have already shown their effectiveness on the battlefield. 
Russia has also made use of them. 
Earlier this year, Mr Fedorov called on market leader DJI to stop selling drones in Russia and, in a significant intervention for a Chinese firm, it halted sales in both Russia and Ukraine.
""Russia is using hobby/commercial drones to strike and conduct reconnaissance in their unprovoked and unfair war,"" Mr Fedorov wrote.
""It is crucial that the world's largest commercial drone-maker, DJI, stopped sales in Russia.""
Valerii Iakovenko, co-founder of Ukrainian company DroneUA, told BBC News that DJI's action had pushed up costs to Ukraine, while Russia was still able to continue to obtain drones via Belarus.
His company had been supplying drones and robotics to the government since before the war.
Drones, along with Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet system and professional radio equipment, were now among the most sought-after technology, he said.
And even small ones were useful mostly providing field data, locating enemy troops and correcting artillery fire.
""A huge number of volunteer operators that joined the Ukrainian forces are also making a difference,"" Mr Iakovenko said.
""Drone pilots of small consumer drones are providing aerial intelligence along the whole front line.
""It is all about the speed of information exchange between the field and in the general staff, to make decisions almost immediately.""
Watch: The volunteers using drones to monitor Russian troops
Mr Bronk says Ukrainians in particular have been very inventive in finding ways to source and then use commercial, as well as military-grade drones.
udes ""using them as improvised loitering munitions to strike targets at significant distance, including, recently, an oil refinery in Rostov with a commercial grade UAV with an improvised warhead"".
But tactics, he warns, are changing.
""What's happened in the last couple of months in Donbas is that the Russians have managed to concentrate their electronic warfare assets and integrate them well with their ongoing operations. 
As a result, Mr Bronk says, whenever Ukraine sends up a small UAV using radio remote control ""the Russian electronic warfare kit picks it up and immediately either takes it over or just cuts the command link electronically and forces it to return"".
, instead of being flown by remote control, small drones have to be programmed to fly a set route and have targets identified when footage is analysed on their return. This slow process is of limited value against moving targets, he said.
Mr Bronk felt that what Ukraine needed were loitering munitions capable of targeting and attacking Russian electronic warfare systems. 
While hobbyist drones were useful, at the moment ""grassroots support in terms of generating military equipment is probably of as much value in terms of morale for the people who are contributing, as well as the people on the front lines"". "	/news/technology-62048403
sports	Modern pentathlon obstacle course details announced	"A rope swing, monkey bars and a ""tsunami wall"" will be among the challenges facing athletes as part of changes to modern pentathlon.
Obstacle course racing is set to be part of a modern pentathlon competition for the first time next month at a test event in Ankara, Turkey.
Show jumping was removed by UIPM, the sport's international governing body, after the Tokyo Olympics.
However there have been protests at the decision.
Pentathlon United - a group against show jumping's removal - says the sport is in ""crisis"" and needs an independent investigation.
re were more than 60 proposals for the sport's new fifth discipline.
But UIPM said the obstacle course discipline was being included as it appealed to ""all age groups including youth"" and was ""dynamic and attractive to global audiences"".
It will replace the equestrian element in the Olympic modern pentathlon line-up from the 2028 Los Angeles Games if approved at November's UIPM Congress.
urkey will involve two to four athletes racing each other over a course up to 100 metres long with as many as 10 obstacles which could include:
""tsunami wall"" would be a climbed finish to the course. 
UIPM described the addition of the discipline as ""the biggest shake-up of the Olympic sport in its 110-year history"".
""Athletes have been invited to run, walk, climb, crawl, slither, scramble or otherwise propel themselves to the finish line of a bespoke course in Ankara next month,"" UIPM added.

politics	Hythe Tory councillor resigns over far-right links	"A Tory councillor has quit after fresh evidence emerged over his links to a far-right organisation.
Andy Weatherhead had already been suspended by his local party in Kent after it emerged he used to be a member of the New British Union (NBU).
Hythe West councillor now says he is stepping down as a member on Kent County Council (KCC).
It comes as the BBC uncovered an interview in 2014 which apparently shows the extent of his NBU links.
Mr Weatherhead confirmed he gave the interview, but denied he was NBU policy officer, the term used by the interviewer to introduce him.
He gave the interview to an online radio station called the American Nationalist Network under the pseudonym Andrew Blackhouse.
In the recording, he is heard saying: ""I've always been an admirer of fascism. I've always been an admirer of Benito Mussolini and Sir Oswald Mosley, and last year I was trawling through the internet as one does and came across the New British Union and I thought 'hello, this sounds like right up my street', so I contacted them.""
He also refers to his work for the NBU as ""fleshing out policies"".
Mr Weatherhead apologised in a statement given to the BBC and said: ""It was not my intent to cause harm or offend. It is in the past. I completely and utterly reject anything to do with fascism.""
He said he had not heard from or seen NBU leader Gary Raikes since 2014.
He also claimed that when he had talked about ""fleshing out policies"" in the interview, this meant ""adding punctuation"".
Mr Weatherhead said the policies themselves had been written by the British Union in the 1930s.
Last week, after he was suspended by Folkestone and Hythe Conservatives, he said the NBU had not been a registered political party, had no defined membership and his links with the group were ""in the spirit of education and curiosity"".
He said after 2014 he had re-entered mainstream politics and turned his back on fringe politics ""having seen it for what it truly was"".
r of KCC, Roger Gough, said he welcomed Andy Weatherhead's resignation as a councillor.
He said: ""The views and associations reported have no place in the Kent County Council Conservative group.""

Frasers Group, which includes brands such as House of Fraser and Evans Cycles, is owned by Sports Direct founder and retail billionaire Mike Ashley.
Mr Ashley handed over the day-to-day running of his retail empire to his future son-in law, Michael Murray, in May.
It is understood bosses at Frasers Group had been measuring the productivity of staff on Fridays since the start of the flexible working scheme and decided to pull people back into the office.
Flexible and hybrid working patterns - where some people get to work some days at home and others in offices - have become more common since coronavirus pandemic restrictions were lifted.
However, companies differ in their opinion of new working practices. In April this year, Airbnb decided to let its employees work from anywhere for as long as they like, but last year the boss of Goldman Sachs rejected remote working as a ""new normal"" and labelled it an ""aberration"" instead.
Working from home for part of the week has become the norm for some employees, a survey of managers has suggested.
Chartered Institute of Management found in February that more than 80% of firms had adopted hybrid working - most since the pandemic.
ute said firms should embrace hybrid work as ""best practice"".
In April, Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said hybrid working let firms widen the net when recruiting to try to tackle skills shortages, and it can improve productivity and work/life balance.
However, he added that there were also potential downsides to hybrid working, including the possibility of ""a two-tier workforce"", with a split between those who have lots of flexibility and those who cannot work from home.
UK government said in September 2021 that would like to give workers the right to request flexible working when they start new jobs from day one, and is reviewing more than 1,600 responses to a consultation that closed in December last year."	/news/business-62175875
sports	Rob Burrow's wheelchair accessible van vandalised in Castleford	"Rugby league star and motor neurone disease fundraiser Rob Burrow's wheelchair accessible van was vandalised while his family were out for a Christmas meal, his father has said.
Geoff Burrow said his son had been out in Castleford, West Yorkshire, on Friday when the vehicle was targeted. 
""They made quite a lot of deep scratches on the back of the van where we wheel Rob in on the ramp,"" he said.
He described the culprits as ""cowards"".
family had been out for an evening meal at the Rockello restaurant in the Glasshoughton area and found the damage at about 21:00 GMT. 
Following a tweet sent by Rob's father, the family said they have been inundated with offers to pay for the repairs and businesses willing to carry out the work for free. 
Speaking to the BBC, Mr Burrow said: ""How anybody can do anything like that, it clearly had a disability sign on it and Rob's disability badges on the front.
""The outpouring of kindness shows you that there's more nice people than scumbags like this person, but we could have done without it - we're going through enough without having to deal with this.""
He said the vehicle was parked near the restaurant and was not obstructing any driveways or on any yellow lines.  
""It spoilt a good night out, they're cowards,"" he said.
""How could someone do it to a disability van, how they sleep is their problem I suppose.""

technology	Guardian newspaper hit by suspected ransomware attack	"Guardian newspaper has come under a suspected ransomware attack.
It said there had been a ""serious incident"" affecting its IT systems in the last 24 hours, with disruption to ""behind the scenes services"".
mpany said it was continuing to publish globally to its website - one of the most visited news sites in the world - and was ""confident"" it could still print the physical paper.
Staff have been told not to go into the office and to work from home.
In a statement, the Guardian said: ""Our technology teams have been working to deal with all aspects of this incident, with the vast majority of our staff able to work from home as we did during the pandemic.
""We believe this to be a ransomware attack, but are continuing to consider all possibilities.""
Ransomware is malicious software used by hackers - and often sent via attachments in emails - to gain access to an organisation's or individual's computer systems.
riminals then find and encrypt important or sensitive files - and demand a ransom for them to be unlocked.
Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work?
A huge range of targets - from schools and hospitals to government agencies and media organisations - have fallen victim to ransomware, with research indicating hackers are paid in the majority of cases, especially in the UK.
According to the Press Gazette, the Guardian is the ninth most-read news site in the world, with almost 390 million visits in November.
In its own reporting of the incident, the Guardian said online publishing was ""largely unaffected"".
It said Guardian Media Group chief executive Anna Bateson and editor-in-chief Katharine Viner had sent a message to the company's workforce.
""Thank you to everyone working hard throughout this incident to keep us publishing,"" they said.
""We will continue to keep our staff and anyone else affected informed. 
""With a few key exceptions, we would like everyone to work from home for the remainder of the week unless we notify you otherwise.""
Jake Moore, global cyber-security adviser at security software company ESET, said the Guardian being targeted was not a surprise.
""News organisations have become a regular target for cyber-attacks this year, and these attacks often have even more damaging effects on the companies targeted,"" he said.
""Ransomware can often bring all departments to a standstill, so it is fortunate that despite this attack the organisation will still see some key areas working as usual."" "	/news/technology-64056300
politics	Gerard Hutch: Jonathan Dowdall can begin evidence in murder trial	"Former Sinn Féin councillor Jonathan Dowdall can begin giving evidence on Monday in the Gerard Hutch murder trial, an Irish court has decided.
Mr Hutch is charged with the murder of David Byrne, 33, at a Dublin hotel in 2016, which he denies.
Dowdall was due to stand trial for the same offence but in October he pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of facilitating the murder.
He is serving a four-year sentence for the offence.
Before he takes to the witness box, Dowdall has to be present in court to hear a Garda (Irish police) superintendent from the state's witness protection programme give evidence that his admission to the programme is not performance-related to the evidence he gives against Gerard Hutch.
f superintendent in charge of witness protection is travelling abroad and could only give evidence by Zoom.
urt agreed it was preferable to take a ""live witness"" - albeit of a lower rank - than depend on the vagaries of technology.
rial has been adjourned until Monday.
Mr Byrne was shot dead during a boxing weigh-in at the Regency Airport Hotel in Dublin in February 2016.
Dowdall was sentenced after admitting to facilitating a murder by renting a hotel room for the killers.
Lawyers for Mr Hutch, 59, had argued at the Special Criminal Court in Dublin that Dowdall's willingness to give evidence against their client was a quid pro quo for having the murder charges dropped.
residing judge in the three-judge non-jury court, Ms Justice Tara Burns, rejected that argument.
Dowdall has agreed to take part in the Irish witness protection programme in order to give evidence at the trial.
During the voir-dire - trial within a trial - on the admissibility of Dowdall's evidence, the judge had asked the prosecution about the standing of Dowdall's application to join the state's witness protection programme.
wyer for the prosecution indicated that he was not able to answer.
judge had indicated that she expected an answer on Friday.
On Friday, a barrister for the prosecution indicated that it could be mid-January at the earliest before a final decision is made on Dowdall's application to join the witness protection programme."	/news/world-europe-63918738
politics	Could Boris Johnson really make a comeback?	"Boris Johnson, the man ousted as UK prime minister by his own government just three months ago, has emerged as an early front-runner to be the next prime minister. 
His replacement Liz Truss crashed and burned after 45 days in the job, announcing her resignation after being forced to ditch most of her policy programme after it spooked the financial markets.
A second Johnson premiership would be an extraordinary turnaround even for a politician who has made miraculous comebacks before.
No one has returned as prime minister after resigning as leader since William Gladstone 140 years ago. 
Mr Johnson won a landslide election victory in 2019 - but was forced out by his own MPs after three years in office, following a string of scandals. Under the British constitution, the ruling party can change leaders between general elections.
His final months in office were dogged by accusations he broke ministerial rules by not telling the truth about Covid lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street. 
He remains under investigation by the Parliamentary Standards Committee, which in theory could lead to him being suspended from Parliament, or even being kicked out as an MP. 
mmittee could hold televised evidence sessions in the coming weeks - even calling Mr Johnson to respond in person. Mr Johnson's supporters have dismissed the committee's investigation as a ""witch hunt"".
rospect of Johnson's return to Downing Street has been met with horror by some Conservatives. Former leader Lord Hague warned it could lead to a ""death spiral"" for the Conservative Party.
Foreign Office Minister Jesse Norman said Mr Johnson returning as prime minister would be an ""absolutely catastrophic decision"" while Tory MP Sir Roger Gale has said he would quit the party.
But Mr Johnson's supporters, including cabinet members Jacob Rees-Mogg and Anne-Marie Trevelyan, and former home secretary Priti Patel, say he is the only contender with the backing of the voting public after winning the 2019 general election. They believe he can win the next election for the party too, despite the Labour Party's current commanding poll leads.
Mr Johnson has yet to officially announce he will stand. The first contender to break cover was cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt, who came third in the last leadership election and announced on Friday that she was standing. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak confirmed on Sunday that he would be throwing his hat into the ring.
In his final appearance at Prime Minister's Questions in July this year, Mr Johnson made it clear that he was planning a comeback.
He signed off with ""hasta la vista, baby"". He could only have dropped a heavier hint that he was not finished yet if he had used another catchphrase from the Terminator films: ""I'll be back.""
Johnson bids farewell at PMQs saying: ""Hasta La Vista baby""
Leadership hopefuls need the backing of at least 100 Tory MPs by Monday afternoon to stay in the race. 
mall task for a man who had 148 of his colleagues vote against him in a confidence vote in June - followed by nearly 60 ministerial resignations one month later.
uge of resignations followed revelations that Mr Johnson had ignored accusations of sexual misconduct against Chris Pincher before appointing him deputy chief whip.
On 5 July, two senior cabinet ministers resigned within minutes of each other - including then chancellor Rishi Sunak, who left claiming Mr Johnson was not competent or serious.
But before the resignations, pressure had been building on Mr Johnson for criticism over his handling of parties that took place in Downing Street during Covid lockdowns.
Mr Johnson was one of 83 people fined by police for a string of illegal parties - including a birthday party for Mr Johnson. 
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the former prime minister was ""unfit for office"". Scotland's Frist Minister Nicola Sturgeon called a Mr Johnson return a ""ludicrous suggestion"".
He was described as ""Britain's Berlusconi"" by the Liberal Democrats.
According to betting website Oddschecker, Rishi Sunak is the favourite to become the next prime minister. Mr Sunak has odds of 1/6 to take over from Liz Truss while Mr Johnson is 4/1 with Ms Morduant at 25/1.
If only a single candidate emerges the contest will be over on Monday - if not the new leader will be chosen by a vote from party membership on Friday 28 October.
Polls taken in the final days of Liz Truss' premiership have consistently shown Mr Johnson as the most popular successor among Tory members. 
Patrick English, associate director of polling company YouGov, said ""if Mr Johnson goes to the final two, he's got the edge""."	/news/uk-politics-63342114

36-year-old came out on top in a field of 44 athletes, featuring 28 able-bodied Olympic, world and national champions and four Paralympians.
Pascoe, a European champion in 2014 and 2016, is classified as a World Para-sailing athlete with cerebral palsy. 
""I am very happy to get my title back,"" she said after the success in Brittany, France. 
European Championship is open to able-bodied and Para-athletes.
Pascoe has now called on sailing to return to the Paralympics. It was part of every Paralympics between 2000 and 2016, but dropped for Tokyo 2020 and then failed in a bid to return for the 2024 Games in Paris.

technology	Space debris Australia: Piece of SpaceX capsule crashes to Earth in field	"When Mick Miners, a farmer in New South Wales, Australia, first saw a large black object sticking out of the ground in a remote part of his land, he thought it was a dead tree.
But on closer inspection - and verification from experts - he learned it had fallen from space. 
Australian Space Agency (ASA) later said it came from a SpaceX capsule.
Experts described the discovery as ""rare"" and ""exciting"" - but said such events may become more common. 
ject landed on 9 July in a large area of fields, but was not discovered by Mr Miners until several weeks later. 
wo other pieces were later found nearby, and the ASA asked anyone who came across further items to contact a debris hotline set up by SpaceX. 
Dr Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist at the Australian National University, was called to examine the object. 
He is often called to similar discoveries - the vast majority of which turn out not to be space debris. 
""This has been super exciting to see this all up close, I've never seen a piece of space junk fall like this,"" he said in a video shared online.  
Don Pollacco, a professor of astrophysics at the UK's Warwick University, agreed that it was very rare for space debris to hit land. 
While objects fall from space to Earth every day, the vast majority land in the oceans covering most of the planet, he said. 
What's more, the only recorded case of a person being hit was Lottie Williams, who was unhurt when a piece of space debris landed on her shoulder in Oklahoma, US, in 1997. 
Other incidents include damage to buildings in Ivory Coast in 2020, from pieces of a Chinese rocket. 
However, discoveries on land may become more common - especially as the number of rockets sent to space has hugely increased in recent years. 
Sun is also moving into a cycle of being more active, Prof Pollacco added, a knock-on effect of which may be more debris falling to Earth.
Perhaps more worrying is a study from Canada's University of British Columbia, published in July, which found there was a 10% chance of one or more people being killed by space debris in the next decade.
But Prof Pollacco still says the chance of an individual being hurt is ""almost zero"", adding: ""I don't think people need to be frightened, the likelihood of them getting hit is unbelievably small.""
SpaceX did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment.

entertainment	The Crown: Queen's friend says Netflix show 'makes me so angry'	"A lifelong friend of the late Queen has described Netflix's royal drama The Crown as ""complete fantasy"" and ""so unfair on members of the Royal Family"".
Lady Glenconner, who was a maid of honour at the Queen's coronation, said the show ""just makes me so angry"".
""The trouble is that people, especially in America, believe it completely,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour.
Netflix has defended the show, saying it ""has always been presented as a drama based on historical events"".
Lady Glenconner knew the Queen from childhood and was lady-in-waiting to her sister, Princess Margaret, for more than 30 years. 
She told Woman's Hour: ""It's so irritating. I don't watch The Crown now because it just makes me so angry. And it's so unfair on members of the royal family.""
She cited one episode in series two, which portrayed the Duke of Edinburgh as being responsible for his sister Cecilie taking the flight that resulted in her death in a plane crash in 1937.
""That was completely untrue,"" Lady Glenconner said. ""And I think to say something like that about people is terribly hurting. Nobody wants to have their relations trashed like that.""
In the third series, Princess Margaret was shown having a competition to come up with dirty limericks with US President Lyndon B Johnson in 1965. ""Well, I mean, of course she never did that,"" she said.
Lady Glenconner herself is portrayed in The Crown, and another scene in series three depicts her discussing the merits of various men with the late princess. ""I mean, of course that never happened.""
Helena Bonham Carter, who played Margaret in series three and four, visited Lady Glenconner to ask for her advice, she said.
""She came for about two hours. I told her how Princess Margaret smoked, how she walked.
""I saw Helena after she'd been in The Crown and she said, 'What did you think?' And I said, 'Well, rather disappointed.' And she said, 'I know. But the thing is, I'm an actress, and I have to do what's written for me.'""
Lesley Manville has taken over playing Margaret for the latest series, which launched earlier this month.
Her portrayal was convincing enough for US rapper Cardi B to suggest on Twitter on Wednesday that they may have got on well.
Netflix has said: ""The Crown has always been presented as a drama based on historical events.""
reaming giant says the show is described as a fictional drama based on real events in all press materials, cast and crew interviews, on social media, and on the show's landing page on the service.
Meanwhile, Lady Glenconner said she thought there was still a place for royal ladies-in-waiting following reports that Camilla, the Queen Consort, will scrap the tradition.
""The reason for ladies in waiting is that, although we do a lot of jobs and letters and all that sort of thing, we're friends.,"" she said. ""When you go abroad and have a very, very busy day, in the evening I used to go up to Princess Margaret's sitting room and we used to have a drink and laugh and talk together.
""I think ladies in waiting have an ear to the ground too. They know what's going on. I think now the reason they don't perhaps have them - they take a secretary or someone - is it's more professional now. But it was great fun."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63744908

business	Frasers Group said to be close to buying Savile Row tailor - report	"Sports Direct owner Frasers Group is reported to be close to securing the purchase of Gieves & Hawkes, the historic Savile Row tailor.
Frasers Group is said to be in advanced talks to buy the 251-year-old firm, according to Sky News which first reported the news.
retail giant, which was founded by Mike Ashley, emerged as a potential buyer of Gieves & Hawkes in September.
Frasers Group would not officially comment on the report.
Gieves & Hawkes, which has its HQ at Number 1 Savile Row in London - one of the world's most famous fashion addresses - is one of the oldest bespoke tailoring companies.
But it has faced uncertainty ever since its Hong Kong-based owner collapsed into liquidation last year.
Sky News said the value of any deal was not known at this stage.
Retail billionaire Mike Ashley has been one of the High Street's most prominent and colourful figures since founding his business 40 years ago.
Mr Ashley recently stepped down from the board of Frasers Group but remains the group's controlling shareholder.
He had already handed over the running of the group to his son-in-law Michael Murray earlier this year.
Russ Mould, investment research director at AJ Bell, told the BBC's Today programme that there were two reasons Gieves & Hawkes would be an attractive purchase for Frasers Group.
""Frasers, or Sports Direct as it was, has always loved a bargain,"" he said.
""It's bought lots of businesses out of liquidation or that have gone into financial difficulty - Evans, Jack Wills, Missguided - it looks to be doing the same now again with Gieves & Hawkes.
""Secondly, Frasers was developing under Mr Ashley, and now Michael Murray, a plan to go upmarket and let's face it, a Savile row tailoring brand is pretty upmarket.""
Other troubled brands snapped up by Frasers Group in recent years include Game and Sofa.com."	/news/business-63618491
health	Nurses' union wants health secretary to talk pay	"Royal College of Nursing leader Pat Cullen says ""my door is open""
A nurses' strike due to start this week could be called off if the health secretary negotiates ""seriously"" over pay, says the head of the Royal College of Nursing. 
""I won't dig in if he doesn't,"" general secretary Pat Cullen told BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.
Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said NHS pay was a matter for non-political independent review bodies.
Walkouts in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are due on 15 and 20 December.
RCN union is calling for nurses to be given a pay rise of 5% above the RPI inflation rate, which was 14.2% in October.
government has previously announced average pay increases of 4.5% for doctors and 4.75% for other NHS staff - including nurses - in England next year.
Ministers agreed to these after a recommendation by the independent pay review bodies that make suggestions about NHS pay rises.
Ms Cullen urged the health secretary to hold talks with her on a one-to-one basis or negotiate through Acas, the independent organisation which mediates disputes between employers and workers as early as Monday morning.  
She said the union would not be ""found wanting"" in the negotiations but she said its position had not changed.
Asked if the union could accept a lower pay rise, Ms Cullen said: ""Come to the table and let's have the discussion.""
She said her priority was making sure nurses could ""make ends meet"", adding: ""It's not about lining their pockets with gold.""
Mr Cleverly said Health Secretary Steve Barclay had already met with union officials, but added: ""Ultimately, salary negotiations are done between union leaders on behalf of their members and their employer. And in this instance, the nurses' employer is the NHS.""
James Cleverly: ""Negotiations are done between union leaders... and their (members') employer""
NHS England's medical director Prof Stephen Powis said pay was a matter for the independent review body and the government.
He said emergency services and key treatments like kidney dialysis and chemotherapy would continue during the walkouts, but that services would be disrupted.
Under trade union laws, life-preserving care has to be provided during strike action. 
Prof Powis said there was ""trouble brewing this winter"" for the NHS, with an increase in people arriving at A&E and a rising number hospital patients with flu. 
Both Mr Cleverly and Prof Powis said the NHS was prepared for the strike and wanted to minimise any disruption.
Scottish government increased its offer to nurses and other health workers to a minimum increase of £2,205 with more for some staff - that was equivalent to an average 7.5% increase. 
ks with unions are ongoing and the public service workers' union Unison has recommended the offer to members in Scotland. 
Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, said that if Mr Barclay was to mirror Holyrood's approach and commit to boosting wages this year, ""the threat of pre-Christmas strikes could well be lifted"". 
Department of Health and Social Care said the government accepted the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in full, meaning newly qualified nurses had a 5.5% increase while those on the lowest salaries, such as porters and cleaners, received a pay rise of up to 9.3%.
""Ministers have had constructive talks with unions, including the RCN and Unison, on how we can make the NHS a better place to work - and have been clear the door remains open for further talks,"" a spokesperson for the department added.

business	Japanese yen slips to 24-year low against dollar	"Japanese yen has declined to its lowest level against the US dollar since August 1998, prompting the government to weigh action.
r stems from data suggesting the labour market of the world's biggest economy is recovering.
On Thursday, the currency pair breached the key psychological level of 140 yen against the US dollar.
While many central banks in Asia have hiked the cost of borrowing to mirror the US, Japan has not followed suit.
Bank of Japan has maintained its ultra-low interest rates to support economic recovery, and this is one of the reasons the yen has fallen in value against the US dollar and other major currencies.
Higher interest rates tend to attract foreign investment. That increases demand for and the value of currencies from countries with higher interest rates.
A US Labor Department report on Thursday showed that the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a two-month low, suggesting the jobs market is recovering post-pandemic. 
rked buying interest in the US dollar which drove it to a fresh high against the Japanese currency, at 140.23 yen.
But it was not the only currency affected by dollar strength. 
British pound slid by around 5% for the first time since October 2016.
US dollar gained momentum earlier in the week, after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the US central bank would continue to raise interest rates in the coming months.
Mr Powell added that the Fed could keep rates high ""for some time"" at an annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
""It's a strong USD story this week after the hawkish Jackson Hole forum"", Philip Wee, senior currency economist at DBS Bank, told the BBC.
""From here, more Asian central banks are ready to hike, some larger than usual. This should help offset some of the pressures from the strong USD,"" he added.
On Friday, Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government would take ""appropriate"" action to address the yen's decline.
""Excessive, disorderly currency moves could have a negative impact on the economy and financial conditions,"" Mr Suzuki told a press conference.
However, Dwyfor Evans of State Street Global Markets told the BBC that measures to lift the yen ""could prove futile"" because of the gap between interest rates in Japan and much of the rest of the world.
Bank of Japan last intervened in currency markets in 2011, after an earthquake and tsunami triggered the Fukushima nuclear crisis. 
At midday Friday in Asia, the yen has continued to slip, trading around 140.35 against the dollar.

family told their story after the Ambulance Service said it was dealing with the ""highest level of pressure"" it had ever experienced.
Elizabeth said she was fearful that an ambulance would not show up in time if her son had another seizure.
She said that during the incident at their home in County Down last month Oscar initially appeared unresponsive but then started to have a seizure.
""Every minute [waiting for the ambulance] felt almost like 10 minutes,"" she said.
""I thought there was no way back from this for the length of time we waited for someone to come and [I was] just panicking the whole time.""
Ambulance Service said paramedics arrived 26 minutes after it received the call.
It said the initial information it received about Oscar's condition resulted in the call being deemed ""category two"", meaning the target response time was 18 minutes.
But the call was upgraded to ""category one"", meaning it had greater priority.
Ambulance Service said the target response time for ""category one"" calls was eight minutes.
Oscar's condition has since stabilised and he has not had a seizure since that incident but is waiting to see a consultant.
Speaking on Wednesday, the service's assistant director Mark Cochrane said that patients were being put at risk due to the level of demand within the health service in Northern Ireland.
""We have had patients who have waited many hours in excess of the performance targets,"" he said.
One problem is that some ambulance crews cannot transfer their patients to emergency departments immediately on arrival because hospitals are so busy.
refore the patients have to wait in the ambulances while they are parked outside hospitals until an appropriate space becomes available for them inside the building.
knock-on effect is that fewer ambulances are available to deal with urgent calls.
Dr Sean McGovern, an emergency medicine consultant at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald, said ""avoidable harm"" was happening.
Emergency departments were in a ""very tragic, very heart-breaking situation"", he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.
He said that in 30 years of working in emergency medicine he had never seen the situation as bad as it was now.
Former Health and Social Care Board chief executive John Compton said the health service was in ""difficult times"".
He argued that the lack of major change and modernisation within the service and the lack of political leadership at Stormont had exacerbated the problems."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-64064270
entertainment	Rita Moreno: If I wasn't Hispanic, I'd have had a different career	"West Side Story icon says she experienced discrimination in Hollywood
Famed for her role in West Side Story, Rita Moreno says the discrimination she faced in Hollywood stopped her from getting good parts in other films.
""Had it not been for the fact that I'm Hispanic, I would have had a different career,"" she says.
Now aged 91, Rita Moreno has overcome typecasting to become an elite performer known as an EGOT - the winner of Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards - something only 17 artists have ever achieved.
""You sink or swim,"" she says, ""and I just opted to swim.""
When Moreno first came to New York from Puerto Rico, aged five, she was subjected to racist abuse.
""My mom left Puerto Rico and came by ship to America, New York City. Like many women from Puerto Rico she didn't know a word of English,"" says Moreno.
""It's obvious I got that kind of strength of character from her.""
Moreno is one of the women featured on the BBC 100 Women list, which each year names 100 inspiring and influential women around the world. This year the list is honouring the progress that has been made since its inception 10 years ago.
Moreno describes leaving Puerto Rico as a ""reverse Wizard of Oz"", going from the brightly coloured island of her birth to the grey, industrial island of Manhattan. 
Aged just 18, she signed to MGM Studios. But in what would be her first clear experience of how little power she had in that era, the teenager known as Rosa Dolores Alverio was forced to change her name.
""They didn't know what to do with me because of my name,"" she says.
""I didn't like the name Rita but they chose it because I liked the actress Rita Hayworth. Moreno was my stepfather's last name so I took that.""
re is no chance she would ever change it now, she says. ""I wouldn't answer to it, I'm so used to Rita!""
Hollywood was painful. Even her Oscar-winning role in the 1961 film West Side Story had its troubles.
""One day in rehearsal I looked at the song we had to sing, America. And the lyrics were: 'Puerto Rico, you ugly island. Island of tropic diseases.'
""I thought, 'I cannot do this,'"" she says.
rics were changed but the film is still criticised for its crude stereotypes.
Moreno would come up against typecasting over and over again.
""You can't afford to say no!"" she says.
""I made so many crappy movies and played more 'island girls' than you can imagine. Island girls don't have love scenes: island girls are raped or abused.
""I suppose the fear, especially when you're an ethnic minority woman in a very competitive industry, you don't want those opportunities to disappear if you keep saying no.""
But there were notable appearances in The King And I, Carnal Knowledge and the TV show Jane the Virgin - as well as the role of flapper movie girl Zelda Zanders in Singin' in the Rain.
""Oh I loved that part so much, it was the best. So much fun,"" she says.
Her career has now come full circle, with a part in the Steven Spielberg 2021 remake of West Side Story.
""When we first met, I put on my most polite voice and said, 'Mr Spielberg, I'm really flattered. But I don't do cameos.'""
But he wasn't offering her a cameo, he was offering a full part, and - in a sign of the change in power dynamics - a role as an executive producer.
It was a stark contrast from one of her early setbacks.
Sixty years ago, West Side Story was breaking box office records and Moreno had become the first Latina to win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.
""I approached an agent, a very successful woman and asked, 'Do you suppose you would take me on as a client?'
""And she very quickly responded, 'No,'"" says Moreno. ""It's like the blood left my entire body in a pool around my ankles.""
But it was her follow up remark that cut deepest: ""Sweetheart, you don't have what it takes.""
Having been a star during Hollywood's Golden Age, as well as the rock and roll era, it is unsurprising that Moreno has been romantically involved with some of the entertainment industry's most famous men.
""I had several dates with Elvis, who was quite beautiful by the way - he was gorgeous... very shy, very sweet, very beautiful,"" she says.
""And then he asked me out and we went out a couple of times, and that was a disaster because I was madly in love with Marlon.""
Her relationship with Marlon Brando was troubled. While she describes him as the ""lust"" of her life, their problems had a real impact on her mental health.
""I tried to end my life,"" she says. ""I thought it was the only way I could end it. I was so obsessed with him, and he with me.""
Moreno became pregnant at a time when abortion was still banned in the US. Brando paid for her to have an illegal procedure, but it went wrong and she had to be taken to hospital.
Moreno was particularly shocked when Roe v Wade was overturned earlier this year, effectively ending a constitutional right for millions of women in the US to access abortion.
""I wept,"" says Moreno.
""I couldn't believe it. I'm absolutely astonished because of what it does to very young women. It's always the poor people, the people who are struggling to survive who get the worst of this.""
Politics and representation are important to Moreno and she cares deeply about how Hollywood portrays ethnic minorities.
Viola Davis, who is black, once said she had a career comparable to Meryl Streep's but wasn't paid or recognised in the same way as a white actress. Rita relates wholeheartedly.
""Oh, I would have been perceived on the same level if I was white, I honestly do. I could be dead wrong. We'll never know. But it does hurt.""
Nevertheless she still loves acting and continues to work, including in the latest instalment of the Fast and Furious franchise.
She wants to live to see progress made where the world can name more than one Puerto Rican superstar.
""Jennifer Lopez is great, but why is she the only one that anyone thinks of when it comes to the Hispanic community?""

politics	Ukrainian refugee cruise ship deal extended	"Ukrainian refugees will spend a further five months on a ship which has been accommodating them since June, the Scottish government has announced.
MS Victoria is serving as temporary accommodation for families arriving in Scotland from the war-torn country.
ruise liner is docked in Leith, Edinburgh and is currently housing about 1,275 Ukrainians.
Scottish government said it will continue to provide ""safe accommodation for displaced people"" until June 2023.
re is also an option to extend this deal further. 
A second cruise ship used for accommodating displaced Ukrainian refugees is docked in Glasgow.
More than 21,500 people with a Scottish sponsor have arrived in the country since the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, representing 20% of all UK arrivals.
Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton, has criticised the extension.
He said: ""This isn't a new life, it's a new limbo. Ukrainian refugees deserve a long-term solution.
""I spoke to aid workers, working in Lviv, connecting Ukrainian refugees fleeing to Scotland with homes and routes out of Ukraine, who have described the Scottish government as being humiliatingly underprepared.
""They wanted the kudos of throwing open their doors but they did none of the groundwork.""
Appropriate long-term accommodation is yet to be identified for those living on the cruise ships.
However, the Scottish government pointed out it has provided up to £50m of funding for local authorities and registered social landlords to bring old properties back into use to address the situation. 
Neil Gray, the Scottish government minister with responsibility for refugees from Ukraine, said: ""We do not want people to spend any longer than is absolutely necessary in temporary accommodation.
""However, we know from speaking to those on board the MS Victoria that it is a safe environment that has built a powerful sense of community.
""We've extended the contract with the MS Victoria to continue to safely accommodate arrivals from Ukraine. Work continues to match people in temporary accommodation with hosts and matching teams are operating on board both ships."""	/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-63845498
business	Cost of living: Iceland to offer interest-free loans to customers	"Iceland will offer customers interest-free loans to help with their food shop amid soaring inflation. 
upermarket trialled the scheme in Huddersfield and Rhyl, Denbighshire, before rolling it out across Wales, where more than 500 customers used it. 
Managing director Richard Walker said loans - provided by charity-owned lender Fair For You - would only be offered to those who can afford them. 
""real value"" of pay fell by 3% from April to June, according to new data. 
Repayments are set at £10 per week, with customers able to choose the day they are made and overpay if convenient to them. 
me comes after a regional pilot trial, where it found 92% of customers using food banks previously had stopped or reduced their use of them. 
During the pilot phase, customers paid interest on loans, however Iceland have now decided to make all loans interest-free for the national roll-out. 
Rhyl was initially included as a pilot area, before expanding across Wales, as over 500 Welsh customers used the loan service. 
Iceland's 'food club' has teamed-up with ethical lender 'Fair for You' to help customers purchase everyday items.
Office for National Statistics (ONS) found average wages in the UK rose by 4.7% in three months, but this was below the rate of inflation - which was 9.4%. 
gap between pay growth and inflation is the biggest since records began more than 20 years ago, as the current inflation figure is 9.4%, while wage growth falls far behind at 4.7%.
frozen food provider also reported that this year 8.4 million people are going hungry, and 9 million families who receive benefits will be an average of £500 worse off due to inflation.
Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live this morning, Iceland's managing director Richard Walker said: ""We started piloting for 18 months in some of the most deprived areas around the UK and actually the results were phenomenal. 
""The Social Impact Reporting showed that over 90% of people reduced their need to go to food banks, improved people's credit scores, their mental health, they ate better, and 70% of them didn't fall behind on essentials like rent and council tax.""
He went on to explain how the loan actually works: ""You can apply online you get a response as quickly as in an hour. 
""We're not the loan provider but Fair for You will only loan to people who can afford to repay it.
""Those on a regular salary and people who are who are well off, it wouldn't apply, and nor would someone who you know, quite frankly couldn't afford to repay.""
When asked what happens if the loan is not repaid on time, Mr Walker said: ""It's a collaborative, flexible process, people are helped not harassed. 
""The debt is not sold off to third parties, and third party debt collectors are not brought in. 
""Actually, everyone is put on a flexible long term payment plan if they can't afford to repay.""
Successful applicants for the loan will receive a preloaded food club card within five to seven business days.
Iceland chain began in the 1970s, founded by Mr Walker's father, and now has nearly 1,000 UK stores, with its headquarters on Deeside industrial park in Flintshire."	/news/uk-wales-62560997
sports	Thomas Bjorn wins in Mauritius, James Kingston tops Legends Tour merit list	"Former Ryder Cup captain Thomas Bjorn won the Legends Tour's season finale in Mauritius as James Kingston claimed the senior circuit's order of merit.
Dane shot a closing 67 in the MCB Championship at Belle Mare Plage to win by seven strokes from South African Kingston and England's Simon Brown.
He led by four going into the last day after a course-record 61 on Saturday.
Kingston recovered from an opening 74 to seal the merit title from Brazil's Adilson de Silva, who was tied fourth.
Kingston's first round had given Da Silva hope of an unlikely victory in the merit race but the leader in the overall standings responded with a 64 and a 65.
rounds, combined with his closest challenger bogeying the last, meant Kingston  finished a shot ahead of Da Silva in Mauritius and more than 500 points in front on the order of merit.
""""I am quite relieved I must say. To think a whole year's play came down to the last tournament, the last round, the last few holes, unbelievable!"" said Kingston.
Wales' Philip Price - who could have claimed the merit title had he won in Mauritius - carded a poor final-round 75 to slip down to a share of 25th, although the 2010 Ryder Cup hero remained third in the overall standings.
Paul Lawrie - who did not play in Mauritius - was fourth in the order of merit, with his fellow Scot Euan McIntosh in sixth.
McIntosh's decision to turn professional again three years ago continues to look a good one.
He originally joined the paid ranks in 1990 but, after regaining his amateur status, he become the oldest player in 35 years to win the Scottish Amateur when he did so aged 49 in 2018.
ry encouraged him to turn pro again and he earned his Legends Tour card the following year.
Bjorn, whose previous tournament performance was in Madrid in October, began shakily on the Legend course at Belle Mare Plage, making three bogeys in his first seven holes.
But his bogey on the 7th was the last shot he dropped all week, playing the subsequent 47 holes in 19 under par.
""I had no form as such coming into this event but as soon as I saw the course at Belle Mare Plage I loved it. It just suited my eye,"" said Bjorn, whose son Oliver caddied for him.
""I took advantage of the par fives and once I got in front I was able to play sensibly and not give the others a feeling they could catch me.
""That was Oliver's first time on the bag for me so he is one-for-one; I've told him he needs to do another week when I don't do so well so he sees what I am really like.""
Miguel Angel Martin played with Bjorn in the final group but while the former Ryder Cup player made no bogeys in his five-under final round, the Spaniard dropped four shots in nine holes in the middle of his to fall away.
Martin's 72 left him in a share of sixth on 11 under with Englishmen Paul Eales and Phil Archer as well as New Zealander Michael Long.
Swedish pair Joakim Haeggman - last week's winner at Constance Lemuria in the Seychelles - and his fellow former Ryder Cup player Jarmo Sandelin were in the group behind but failed to mount a challenge as they shot 72 and 77 respectively.
rismatic Sandelin accidentally snapped his driver on the 18th tee on Saturday and used a new one only twice in his final round, making double bogey on both occasions.
He finished in a tie for 16th with former Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley while two former major champions, Tom Lehman and Michael Campbell, were in a share for 37th."	/sport/golf/63933780
politics	Menai bridge: Third crossing by 2030 likely - Welsh government	"A third bridge linking Anglesey to the north Wales mainland is ""very likely"", according to the Welsh government.
Plans to build a crossing by 2030 were unveiled in an update on planned infrastructure projects.
Longstanding calls for another bridge were amplified recently after the temporary closure of the Menai Bridge, leaving only one crossing.
In 2018 the Welsh government had previously announced its preferred option for a third route.
was to build a new bridge to the east of Britannia Bridge, and make improvements to Junction 8 and 8A of the A55.
k of the project quietened in recent years, but has now been included in the Welsh government's list of infrastructure projects published on Monday. 
ument states that a third Menai crossing would ""improve safety, journey times and network resilience"".
Welsh government estimates that the project would cost £400m, with a stated intention of starting construction in 2027 and completing it by 2029/30.
Although all projects in the document are said to be ""very likely"" to be carried out, the Welsh government has emphasised that there is no ""formal commitment"" to do so.
""This reflects the possibility of future uncertainties, including the future public spending outlook,"" the document said.
Currently all road building projects have been suspended by the Welsh government while it holds a review to assess their environmental impact.
It added: ""Achieving our decarbonisation targets will be at the heart of decision making for infrastructure developments.""
Plans for a third Menai crossing were welcomed by the Plaid Cymru MS for Ynys Mon, Rhun ap Iorwerth.
""Described as having 'high probability of being delivered', we'll keep pushing to make it,"" he tweeted.
Welsh government's infrastructure document also includes plans for improvements to the A55, A494 and A458 in Flintshire.
Its stated aim is to carry out ""improvement of approximately 7.5 miles (12km) of carriageway between Queensferry and Northop to address traffic congestion, resilience and safety issues in the Deeside area"".
Welsh government said: ""The third Menai crossing will be looked at as part of the roads review, taking into consideration the environmental impact and the affordability of the project in light of the current economic situation."""	/news/uk-wales-63971625
health	South West Acute Hospital: SWAH announcement 'devastating'	"mporary withdrawal of emergency general surgery from South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) is ""shocking"" and ""devastating"", locals have said.
Western Health and Social Care Trust has not said when it expects emergency general surgery to resume.
Its chief executive officer, Neil Guckian, said that ""patients will be safer with these changes"".
But some people in County Fermanagh did not seem convinced about Thursday's announcement. 
""The trust don't understand what it's like to have a rural hospital - travel is not acceptable,"" Dermot Browne told BBC News NI.
""We fought hard to get this hospital here in the first place.""
Mr Browne added that ""the direction of travel has been concerning for people here"".
""If there is an issue with staff that needs to be resolved with services reinstated as soon as possible.""
Despite saying the move was temporary, the trust did not say when it expected emergency general surgery would resume.
mergency department and other services including obstetrics will continue to operate as normal.
Other - mostly lower grade - surgeons will remain on site at the County Fermanagh hospital.
rust said this was necessary to protect the public's safety after it had problems recruiting surgical staff.
Protesters gathered outside the town hall in objection to the announcement.
Representatives from the trust held a meeting with local community and council representatives in Enniskillen Town Hall on Thursday evening.
At it, Mr Guckian said that regardless of what had been reported in the media, he was ""proud of the engagement between the trust and the council"".
He said the trust was dealing with a very difficult situation in regard to emergency surgery and was ""working our way through this"".
He paid tribute to all surgeons at SWAH for maintaining services over the years in challenging circumstances. 
However, Reggie Ferguson, chairman from Save Our Acute Services (SOAS), told the meeting it was his organisation's belief that the trust had been deliberately running down services in preparation for the announcement.
""This has been on the cards for a long time,"" he said.
""Your communication is terrible, everything seems to be behind the scenes.""
Referring to the region's poor infrastructure in the context of proposals to transport some patients to other hospitals, Mr Ferguson added: ""The road to Altnagelvin would make you sick if you weren't sick already."" 
UUP councillor Diane Armstrong said it was ""a dark day that affects everybody, man, woman and child"".
Ms Armstrong said the people of Fermanagh and south Tyrone ""feel marginalised by this decision"", and she was personally ""absolutely disgusted"".
No one likes change -  especially if it affects your local health service.  
But according to Raphael Bengoa - and several other health experts who've penned health reviews - change is necessary if Northern Ireland's health system is to be sustainable. 
People in Enniskillen say they are the latest ""casualties"" in plans to change how services are delivered across the region. 
Western Trust argues that change is necessary as the service is no longer safe. 
Whatever the argument, local people say it feels like this is being thrust on them as a last resort.  
me what should have taken place was much needed dialogue, explanation and local people being properly informed about how the proposed changes will affect them.
Instead, they say, a vacuum was created which encouraged rumour and misinformation that SWAH was set to remove all its emergency services. 
While making any sort of change to the Northern Ireland health and social care system can be politicised and emotive - not having those conversations in advance can often be even more problematic. 
Diane McCaffery, who attended with her husband Eunan, is a retired emergency care manager from the cardio assessment unit at SWAH.
She said she had seen first hand how emergency surgery saved lives and thought this decision to reduce surgical services was ""catastrophic"".
Carmel Tracey and her daughter Emily said they ""know the implications"" of the announcement.
""Having to be transferred could put your life at risk. We deserve better,"" said added Ms Tracey.
Sinn Féin MP Michelle Gildernew challenged the trust to set out clearly their plan for the restoration of emergency surgical services.
""The people of Fermanagh (and South Tyrone) need clarity from the trust on the steps they have taken to date, but most importantly, the actions they will now take, to ensure emergency surgical services at SWAH are urgently restored. 
""Vague assurances will not do.""
Earlier in the day, DUP MLA Deborah Erskine said she understood the concerns of constituents but felt there was good news for the hospital's future with the announcement that it is to become a new centre for planned surgery.
""The pressures with surgeons date back to 2018 in the Western Trust,"" she said.
""We need to have a system, we need to have a way forward in which we ensure services are safe for both the workplace in the SWAH and also for our patients."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63644073
business	Cost of living: Energy bills rise but help cushions blow	"Energy prices rose for millions of households on Saturday, but the increase has been cushioned by a government cap on the cost per unit.
It stepped in after an 80% increase in domestic gas and electricity bills was earmarked for the first half of winter.
A typical annual bill has gone up from £1,971 to £2,500 but will be further mitigated by cost-of-living payments.
But prices are still twice as high as last winter, and charities say that will leave many struggling.
queeze is particularly acute for those on prepayment meters, who pay for energy as they use it, and so have largely been unable to smooth out increased bills over the year.
""The most vulnerable, including children, will be cold and hungry as energy prices spiral, despite government support,"" said Adam Scorer, from charity National Energy Action.
People paying by direct debit tend to build up credit during the warmer, lighter summer months which then funds some of their extra use during the winter.
Jaqueline Jones in Urmston in Manchester says she and her husband Joe are already taking steps to cut down on their energy bills.
""We're only filling the kettle to the amount we need, watching how often we put the washing machine on - little things like that,"" she said. 
re also hanging washing indoors and finishing it off for 10 minutes in the dryer, as opposed to using the dryer more often. 
re on a standard variable tariff for their electricity and energy bills, but haven't received an updated bill recently to know whether the measures are making a big difference as of yet.
""Hopefully when the actual bill does come in it won't be too much,"" Jacqueline says, adding that she is now watching their smart meter every time they make a cup of tea.
""I watch the numbers every time I put the kettle on - oh my goodness how it whizzes around!""
But she says the situation overall is frightening for the couple who are retired and rent a Victorian property. 
""We're both pensioners and we don't have a great pension other than the government one, so we have to make sure it's going to last out, along with the bit of savings we do have.
""We'll just have to see and play it by ear... but we are trying our best.""
Every household pays for the energy it uses. There is no absolute cap on the total cost.
Under the government's two-year price guarantee, the average unit price for dual fuel customers paying by direct debit on variable deals is limited to 34p per kilowatt hour (kWh) for electricity and 10.3p per kWh for gas.
With standing charges added, it means a typical household - one that uses 12,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of gas a year, and 2,900 kWh of electricity a year - will not pay more than £2,500 a year for energy from Saturday. 
Without this intervention, that annual bill would have been £3,549 a year, rising from the expired level of £1,971 a year. Those on prepayment meters pay slightly more.
Prime Minister Liz Truss said that the government's support meant that people and businesses across the country were protected. 
However, last winter, the price cap - governed by the energy regulator Ofgem - meant the same typical household paid £1,277 a year.
ubling of a typical energy bill is why millions of households have cut back on their energy use, according to a survey by the consumer group Which?.
Its findings, which it shared with BBC News, suggested that 58% of those asked reported reducing their usage of lights and appliances around the home. More than four in 10 said they had reduced hot water consumption, including taking fewer and shorter showers.
Given the wider context of rising prices, the consumer group also said that 60% of those surveyed had bought cheaper food products than usual and 36% had planned meals more, for example by batch cooking.
Which? has launched a campaign calling on supermarkets, telecoms and energy businesses to offer more support to customers facing financial difficulty, such as ensuring cheaper social broadband tariffs and value-range food is equally accessible to shoppers across the country.
""While government intervention is necessary, we also believe businesses across essential services can and should do more to help,"" said Rocio Concha, its director of policy and advocacy.
government's earlier package of cost-of-living payments is continuing. 
xt stage begins from Saturday as everyone's energy bill will eventually be cut by £400. The discount will be applied over six months, with a reduction of £66 in October and November, and £67 every month between December and March 2023. 
unt will be made automatically by energy suppliers in England, Scotland and Wales, with plans for the equivalent to be paid in Northern Ireland.
re will be further payments later in the winter for people who receive benefits and are on low incomes, and pensioners.
rgy plans were in place ahead of last Friday's tax-cutting mini-budget which has been followed by days of turmoil on the markets.
government has said its energy guarantee would cost £60bn for the first six months.
However, industry analysis suggests the total bill could be between £130bn and £150bn.
will be met by an increase in government borrowing, but the likely cost of this has soared after financial markets reacted badly to the chancellor's plans to introduce tax cuts worth £45bn.
re are also fears that the upheaval might affect the housing market.
Hundreds of mortgage products have been pulled since last Friday, and are likely to return at higher costs, amid fears the Bank of England will have to raise interest rates much more sharply than previously expected.

health	Rotherham: Independent inquiry to examine death of Yusuf Mahmud Nazir	"An independent investigation will be launched into the treatment of a five-year-old boy who died after being sent home from hospital.
Yusuf Mahmud Nazir's uncle said he had ""begged"" staff at Rotherham Hospital to treat Yusuf's severe throat infection.
He said he was told the children's ward had ""not got the doctors"" and ""not got the beds"". Yusuf died on 23 November.
Hospital chief executive Dr Richard Jenkins said investigators from outside South Yorkshire would review his care.
In a letter to Sarah Champion MP, who represents the family's constituency in Rotherham, Dr Jenkins said he was working with NHS England to ""identify appropriate independent investigators"".
He said: ""It is vital that a thorough and independently conducted investigation takes place as soon as possible so the family can have answers to their concerns and we can identify where changes need to be made.""
He said the family would be involved in deciding the terms of reference for the investigation.
Dr Jenkins said he spoke to Yusuf's uncle Zaheer Ahmed to ""directly express my condolences and to apologise to the family"".
Rotherham NHS Hospital Trust previously said it would carry out an internal investigation into Yusuf's treatment.
Ms Champion said: ""I'm so relieved that the wants and needs of the family have been listened to and we are going to get this independent inquiry.
""Independent is the key bit. It has to be really robust and independent.""
She said the investigation was important because it could help prevent a similar tragedy in future.
Mr Ahmed said Yusuf fell ill with a sore throat on 13 November. The following day he went to his GP and was prescribed antibiotics.
When the boy's condition worsened he was taken to Rotherham Hospital but was not admitted.
On Friday, 18 November, Yusuf was unable to speak, eat or drink so was taken by ambulance to Sheffield Children's Hospital.
He was given intravenous antibiotics. However, his condition deteriorated and he died on Wednesday 23 November.

Kate Brunner KC, who is leading the probe, has asked for it to cover the period between December 2019 to April 2022, rather than September 2021.
would see the review cover the time up to the axing of Covid restrictions.
Home Affairs Minister Jane Poole-Wilson will ask Tynwald to back the changes.
Ms Brunner's review is set to examine all aspects of the Manx government's pandemic response, including legal restrictions, the vaccine roll out and Covid support schemes, as well as the deaths as a result of the virus.
More than 100 people have died from the virus on the Isle of Man.
Conclusions from the review and any subsequent recommendations are due to be laid before Tynwald by December 2023.
wald's Public Accounts Committee, which led previous investigations into the island's Covid response, and the Council of Ministers have both agreed to Mr Brunner's ""logical"" request.
xtension to April would allow ""the entirety of the major responses to the pandemic to be considered"", they added.
At the November sitting of Tynwald politicians will also be asked to approve another tweak to the review's terms of reference to make clear how evidence will be presented.
ge clarifies that any evidence will be published at Ms Brunner's discretion, ""subject to considerations of confidentiality, relevance, cost and practicality"".

technology	Medibank: Hackers release abortion data after stealing Australian medical records	"Hackers who stole customer data from Australia's largest health insurer Medibank have released a file of pregnancy terminations.
It follows Medibank's refusal to pay a ransom for the data, supported by the Australian government.
Medibank urged the public to not seek out the files, which contain the names of policy holders rather than patients.
CEO David Koczkaro warned that the data release could stop people from seeking medical attention.
rminations can occur for a range of reasons including non-viable pregnancy, miscarriages and complications.
""These are real people behind this data and the misuse of their data is deplorable and may discourage them from seeking medical care,"" he said.
f 9.7 million Medibank customers was stolen last month - the latest in a string of major data breaches in Australian companies in recent months. 
kers this week published their first tranche of information after Medibank refused to pay a $10m (£8.7m; A$15.6m) ransom - about $1 for every customer.
Some Australians say they have been targeted by scammers after their medical details were posted online.
Former tennis champion Todd Woodbridge - who is recovering from a heart attack - said he had been pestered by calls from scammers who had known which hospital he had been in.
""I think I'm one of those people that have been scammed by the Medibank situation, I'm a customer of theirs,"" he told Melbourne radio station 3AW on Wednesday.
He and others have criticised Medibank for the security breach.
Earlier this week the hackers released a set of customer detail files named ""good-list"" and ""naughty-list"". 
files included people's health claims data - including medical procedure history -  as well as names, addresses, birthdates and government ID numbers.
ursday, the hackers on their forum added they had also: ""added one more file abortions.csv..."". 
Medibank has apologised for what it has called the ""malicious weaponisation"" of private information. The hackers got the information after login details allowing access to all its customer data was stolen.
Australian government has also defended the company's decision to not pay the ransom.
Both have warned that more releases of customer information are expected. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said that he is also Medibank customer.
In September, Australia's second-largest telecommunications firm Optus was also targeted for extortion, after the personal data of about 10 million customers was stolen in what the company called a cyber-attack.
Several Australians have identified themselves as being affected by both breaches.
Medibank data has been posted on a blog linked to Russian ransomware group REvil, local media have reported."	/news/world-australia-63579985
business	Cineworld cancels The Lady of Heaven film screenings after protests	"Cineworld has cancelled all UK screenings of a film about the daughter of the Prophet Muhammad, after it prompted protests outside some cinemas. 
ma chain said it made the decision ""to ensure the safety of our staff and customers"".
More than 120,000 people have signed a petition for The Lady of Heaven film to be pulled from UK cinemas. 
Bolton Council of Mosques called the film ""blasphemous"" and ""underpinned with a sectarian ideology"".
But the film's producer, Malik Shlibak, said ""no one should dictate for the British public what they can and cannot watch or discuss"", describing the protesters as ""fringe groups"". 
film, which was released in UK cinemas on 3 June, claims to tell the story of Lady Fatima, the daughter of Prophet Muhammad. 
It has been criticised by some groups for depicting the Prophet Muhammad - which is seen as an insult in Islam - and for its portrayal of prominent revered figures in early Sunni Islam. 
It was pulled from the Cineworld chain after reported protests in Bolton, Birmingham and Sheffield.
In Bolton, more than 100 people protested outside the cinema, Bolton News reported.
In an email to Cineworld - reported by Bolton News - Bolton Council of Mosques chairman Asif Patel said the film was ""underpinned with a sectarian ideology"" and ""misrepresents orthodox historical narratives and disrespects the most esteemed individuals of Islamic history"".
Muslim news site 5Pillars also shared a picture on Twitter of what it said showed 200 Muslims protesting against the film outside a Birmingham branch of Cineworld on Sunday.
Video footage circulating online appears to show a manager of a Cineworld cinema in Sheffield informing protesters that a screening of the film had been cancelled, the Guardian reported.
Mr Shlibak criticised the decision by Cineworld to pull the film, saying it was ""cowering"" to the protesters' demands.
He told the BBC: ""Now they see any time they're upset or mildly offended they'll do the same.""
Mr Shlibak added that there were millions of Muslims in the UK, and the protesters did not represent all of their views.
""We need to be very careful not to cower down to that and do the exact opposite, which is say to the people that we are tolerant, we accept different views and positions and we're happy to disagree, even passionately, but there should be no censorship involved."" 
But he also said the protests would fail at shutting down the film, adding that a ""large, large population across the UK have just heard about the film for the first time, so that's brilliant for us"". 
Health Secretary Sajid Javid also criticised the decision to pull the film.
Speaking to TalkTV on Wednesday, the health secretary said: ""You might not like what someone's got to say, but they have a right to say it.""
Mr Javid pointed out that there are no blasphemy laws in the UK and warned that would be ""an incredibly dangerous road to go down"".
""What we have in this country is freedom of speech and expression and that is a fundamental value,"" he added.
Unlike some incidents in the past, opposition to the film is not primarily about the way the Prophet Mohammed is depicted - though there is a CGI portrayal of him in it.
Criticism mainly centres around the way the Shia Muslim film-maker and cleric Yasser Al-Habib has portrayed prominent revered figures in early Sunni Islam, implying that there are comparisons between their actions with those of the Islamic State group in Iraq.  
Leaders of the protests have said while they want the film banned, their demonstrations were peaceful, but cinemas clearly felt their behaviour was intimidating enough to warrant screenings to be pulled.  
Outrage since that happened - including from some Muslims who had wanted to see the film - has been because a relatively small number of people have managed to exert their will in a way that that appears to normalise censorship on the grounds of blasphemy.
Muslim Council of Britain, the UK's largest Muslim umbrella organisation, has described the film as ""divisive"". 
In a statement on Sunday, the organisation said it ""supports those scholars and leaders who are advocating for greater unity and for the common good"". 
""There are some - including many of this film's supporters or those engaging in sectarianism in their response - whose primary goal is to fuel hatred,"" the statement added.
Screenings of the film were still scheduled for Wednesday at a number of Vue cinemas in London and south-east England.
In a statement, a spokesperson said: ""Vue takes seriously the responsibilities that come with providing a platform for a wide variety of content and believes in showcasing films of interest to diverse communities across the UK.  
""Vue will only show a film once the BBFC (the independent British Board of Film Classification) has assessed and rated a film. The Lady of Heaven has been BBFC accredited and is on show in a number of our cinemas.""
mpany would not confirm whether any screenings had been cancelled, but added: ""Decisions about how long a film remains on show are taken on a site-by-site basis and based on a variety of commercial and operational factors.""
A spokesperson for Cineworld said: ""Due to recent incidents related to screenings of The Lady of Heaven, we have made the decision to cancel upcoming screenings of the film nationwide to ensure the safety of our staff and customers."""	/news/business-61729392
business	Rising prices see basic pay fall at fastest rate in a decade	"Regular pay is falling at the fastest rate in more than a decade when taking into account rising prices, the Office for National Statistics has said.
Between February and April, pay excluding bonuses was down 2.2% from a year earlier when adjusted for inflation, the ONS said.
UK household budgets are being squeezed by record fuel and energy costs.
However, pay including bonuses is outpacing price rises, rising by 0.4% when taking inflation into account.
Sam Beckett, head of economic statistics at the ONS, said a ""high level of bonuses"" was continuing to ""cushion the effects of rising prices on total earnings for some workers"".
""But if you exclude bonuses, pay in real terms is falling at its fastest rate in over a decade,"" she added.
Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the latest figures showed the UK's jobs market ""remains robust"" with redundancies at an all-time low.
""Helping people into work is the best way to support families in the long term, and we are continuing to support people into new and better jobs,"" he added.
But Labour's Jonathan Ashworth said ""millions in work are in poverty"" and accused ministers of showing ""utter complacency about the huge levels of economic inactivity"".
When adjusted for inflation, regular pay has fallen roughly by 1.6% for private sector workers and 4.5% for those in the public sector.
ONS noted that the latest wage figures are compared with the same period in 2021 when Covid restrictions were in place and some workers were furloughed.
umber of job vacancies in the UK rose to a new record of 1.3 million from March to May, the ONS said.
unemployment rate stood at 3.8% in the February to April period, up slightly from last month, while the employment rate was 75.6%, which is still lower than before the pandemic.
How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch.
Neil Carberry, chief executive of the Recruitment and Employment Confederation, said that with record numbers of roles available, ""pay is growing strongly as companies seek to attract people to work for them"".
But he warned if ""we don't address the fact that there are not enough people looking for work, this could put another dampener on the UK's economic growth"".
Josh Goodall, the co-managing director of building company Elite Building Maintenance in West Yorkshire, told the BBC that trying to recruit experienced tradespeople such as builders, joiners and plasterers was ""an absolute nightmare"" in the current climate.
""We have got a couple of young lads working for us and they are currently getting trained up at the moment, but you can only train so many people and you need experienced workers,"" he said.
job vacancies showed hospitality and healthcare were among the sectors with the highest number of jobs available, with construction and manufacturing also having high vacancy numbers.
Mr Goodall said that as a result of the tight labour market, he was having to raise wages, with an experienced builder now asking for about £250 per day, compared with about £150 before the pandemic.
, along with the soaring costs of materials such as timber and cement, has led to the company charging more.
""We are almost apologising [to customers] saying materials have gone up, fuel has gone up, waste costs have gone up,"" said Mr Goodall.  
""We feel like it's an expensive price but the amount we are making is less than it was before.""
jobs numbers remain a welcome relief from the stagflation seen elsewhere in the UK figures, but the strength here appears to be peaking.
Unemployment remains very low and there was an overall rise in employment over the past three months, though not yet recovering all the lost jobs since before the pandemic.
Still there were some signs of a turning point under the hood of these numbers. Unemployment actually edged up a little. And looking at the single month figures for April, when energy bills spiked and taxes went up, unemployment was up to 4.2% and employment notably down.
For those with jobs, ordinary pay fell in real terms at the fastest rate for a decade. In the private sector, bonuses are cushioning this for some workers reflecting one-off payments and recruitment into new jobs. 
Vacancies remain at record levels too, with a worker shortage starting to have visible consequences at airports and in the NHS. But the defining economic question still to be answered is how much wages can compensate for the surge in the rate of price rises. The answer so far is not much, especially in the public sector.
ONS added the the number of ""economically inactive"" people - those without a job and not seeking to work - had fallen slightly in the past three months, but was still higher than before Covid struck.
Wilson, director of the Institute of Employment Studies, tweeted that the ""incredibly tight"" labour market reflected a smaller workforce than before the pandemic, with up to one million workers now ""missing"".
Ms Beckett from the ONS said that at the start of the pandemic many young people leaving education had ""disengaged"" from looking for work due to most businesses and work places being shut during lockdowns.
But she told the BBC's Today programme that the ""story had changed"" more recently with more people over the age of 50 becoming economically inactive by ""retiring early, or just not needing to work, or indeed suffering ill health"". 
A member of the ""missing million"" is Kevin Butler, who retired from his 17-year career in recruitment to make music.
54-year-old said the pandemic changed his perspective on work when he was furloughed.
""I'm lucky in that I've worked for a long time and been sensible with money in the past and paid off my mortgage, and those little things that make a difference on an everyday basis,"" he added."	/news/business-61794166
technology	Xbox v PlayStation: Giants clash over Call of Duty	"Xbox owner Microsoft has hit back at claims its plan to buy the maker of Call of Duty may unfairly affect its rivals, including Sony, which owns PlayStation.
Microsoft wants to buy Activision Blizzard, which also makes Overwatch and Candy Crush, for $68.7bn (£59.2bn).
UK watchdog looking into the plan has said Microsoft could use Activision games to ""out-compete"" its rivals.
Microsoft said it still hoped the deal would be closed by June 2023.
Competition regulators in Saudi Arabia and Brazil have already approved it. 
But last month, the Competition and Markets Authority announced it would be asking an independent panel to look into the proposal.
Activision Blizzard is one of the world's largest video game developers and publishers, and the Call of Duty franchise has attracted millions of players.
And the CMA suggested buying it could allow Microsoft to monopolise top games such as Call of Duty by making them available primarily on Xbox consoles, PCs and Game Pass, its cloud gaming service.
In a detailed account of its decision to launch an in-depth investigation, published today, the CMA says that ""Call of Duty is sufficiently important that losing access to it (or losing access on competitive terms) could significantly impact Sony's revenues and user base"". 
It also said that ""Microsoft has followed this approach in several past acquisitions of gaming studios, where it made future game releases from those studios exclusive in consoles to Xbox"".
Microsoft says it is committed to keeping Activision's existing titles, including Call of Duty, available on the PlayStation. 
But future titles could be treated differently. 
Microsoft already owns 23 games makers, including Minecraft maker Mojang, and Fallout and Skyrim creator Bethesda. 
Bethesda's upcoming Starfield game will now be an Xbox and PC exclusive, and the CMA suggested that this could also be the case for the studio's Elder Scrolls VI,  based on Microsoft's public statements.
Microsoft says:
And, In a report seen by BBC News, Microsoft calls the CMA's concerns ""a novel theory of harm, unsupported by precedent, economic literature or the evidence"".
In a statement, Sony said the firm believes the deal is ""bad for competition, bad for the gaming industry and bad for gamers themselves.
""This deal would give Microsoft's Xbox ecosystem a unique combination of tech and content, and hence a dominant position in gaming, with devastating consequences for consumers,  independent developers, and Sony itself,"" it added.

politics	What made Senedd members laugh in 2022?	"Senedd's official record, which provides a transcript of proceedings, does not easily reflect the emotions involved in parliamentary debate, but it does indicate ""[laughter]"" when it's particularly conspicuous. 
So what has made Members of the Senedd (MSs) laugh in the Siambr - the Senedd chamber - in 2022? 
Are they things that cross the divide to the written format or did you have to be there to appreciate the humour? 
You can decide for yourself with this selection.
Some of the matters that tickled funny bones involved animals. Conservative group leader Andrew RT Davies - a farmer who famously described himself as ""19 stone of prime Welsh beef"" - seemed to surprise himself with a question about biodiversity on the Senedd estate.
He asked: ""Have you thought about putting habitats in place, such as hedgehog houses, so they can hibernate in those houses and people can show greater interest in the wildlife that's in the bay area? I can't believe I've asked this question, to be honest with you.""
When Minister for Climate Change Julie James made a statement on biodiversity she referred to a film about Yellowstone park in the western United States and the reintroduction of wolves there.
She said the Welsh government had been looking ""at whether the reintroduction of beavers is a good idea in some of our rivers. I have no idea yet - nobody panic.""
Llywydd (presiding officer) Elin Jones drew a laugh by confessing ""I'm panicking more about wolves, actually.""
Huw Irranca-Davies joined in by teasing his fellow Labour colleague Mike Hedges, MS for Swansea East, that he was ""looking forward to the wolves in Singleton Park"" in the city.
Julie James, who represents Swansea West, couldn't resist adding ""there are some people who would say there were already wolves in Singleton Park"".
On the tangential topic of animal produce, when Janet Finch-Saunders was thinking about a summer event and told her Conservative colleague Laura Anne Jones ""I'm very much looking forward to sharing a roast pork and apple sauce"", the latter immediately made clear ""I'm not sharing"".
When the Senedd's only Liberal Democrat, Jane Dodds tried to stand up for farmers by emphasising the financial pressures they face, her comments were open to misinterpretation.
""I'm interested to hear from Mike Hedges that he knows of farmers with pockets full of gold. I'd love to be introduced to them, please."" 
Some of the humour came about when members shared insights into their personal lives, hobbies and interests.
Plaid Cymru's Heledd Fychan told members about her enjoyment of the Anglesey Show.
""I've always visited since being a child, with my lifelong friend Ann, going on the waltzers. We used to do that, and we still do - we're not too old for that. 
""So, I look forward to doing that again. I think I'm sharing too much today, perhaps.""
Conservative James Evans admitted ""golf is probably my number one love in life"". 
After seeing reaction from other members, he added ""no, I won't tell my girlfriend. I spend much of my time on the golf course, and she isn't very happy about that either"".
Health minister Eluned Morgan revealed that she shares her birthday with former senior Labour UK minister Peter Hain, media personality Amanda Holden and John Taylor from Duran Duran ""so I'm in very good company"".
Conservative Tom Giffard's love of the Eurovision Song Contest was illustrated when, in calling on the Welsh government to back a bid for Cardiff to host the contest, he urged ministers to show "" 'Ooh Aah...Just a Little Bit' more ambition"", a reference to the UK entry in 1996, performed by Gina G.
Mr Giffard later referred to something else as ""one of the Conchita Wurst suggestions I've heard in this chamber"", before acknowledging the groans, ""no, that one didn't land. Okay.""  Conchita Wurst won the contest in 2014. 
racticalities of contributing to proceedings can give rise to humour.
Conservative Russell George apologised for ""confusion"" which he said was caused by ""trying to remove my face mask at the same time as not having my translation equipment on."" The Llywydd Elin Jones responded dryly ""multitasking can be difficult for some"". Mr George acknowledged, ""especially for men, yes"".
An unknown MS was waving at a colleague at the precise moment the Llywydd was asking whether anyone was objecting to a proposal to agree a motion. The Llywydd advised ""perhaps you should consider the timing of the wave for next time"".
When deputy presiding officer David Rees called on members to ""avoid heckling"" Andrew RT Davies ""so much"", Mr Davies replied by channelling Dad's Army's Corporal Jones, ""they don't like it up 'em'."" 
When the Finance Minister, Rebecca Evans, brought her contribution to a debate to a close having seen the Llywydd's facial expression she explained, ""I thought I might have been going on too long."" 
Llywydd responded: ""I need to work on my poker face, obviously.""
Seeking to compliment Jane Mudd's leadership of Newport City Council, deputy minister Hannah Blythyn muddled her up with her Welsh government colleague Jane Hutt. 
She valiantly tried to recover the situation: ""Jane Hutt shows leadership as well.""
Finally, what kind of question does the first minister deem to be impossible to answer without attracting criticism in Wales? 
One came from his Labour colleague Huw Irranca-Davies.
""What is your favourite part of the Wales coast path?""
""Oh dear, oh dear,"" Mark Drakeford responded.
""You know a hospital pass when it comes your way in Wales, don't you?
""To choose a part of a path that goes all the way around Wales is guaranteed to offend far more people than it will ever please, so I thank the member for that opportunity."" 
He put his head on the block, citing the walk between Pendine and Amroth.
Humour can be a powerful weapon to score party political points on policy issues, but in the spirit of the season of goodwill, that is a matter for another day."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63986150
entertainment	Georgia Harrison: Revenge porn experience felt like 'grief'	"former Love Island contestant says an amendment to the Online Safety Bill is vital.
Georgia Harrison is seen by most reality TV fans as the fun and adventurous type, best known for appearing on shows like Love Island and The Only Way is Essex.
But for the past two years, the 28-year-old has been absent from our screens.
In December 2020, she started criminal proceedings against her ex-partner, Stephen Bear, who she also met on a reality show.
It was after he used CCTV cameras in his garden to capture them having sex and then sent it to a friend and sold the video online - none of which she consented to.
Last week, Bear was found guilty of one count of voyeurism and two counts of disclosing private sexual photographs or films with the intent to cause distress. 
""It's just been such a whirlwind - I've had so much love and support ever since the verdict,"" Harrison tells the BBC. 
She says she has been passed over for several TV projects and other opportunities since Bear shared the video of them on subscription site OnlyFans two years ago. 
""My agent had conversations with brands, but when they looked at who they wanted to book for a specific job, because of what happened, I was just a red flag,"" she says.
""It's been really hard and there's been a couple of times that I did just have a massive breakdown, television was always my passion and [producers] just couldn't consider me.""
Harrison had a right to remain anonymous in her case due to voyeurism being a sexual offence, but chose to waive it to raise awareness of the effects that so-called ""revenge porn"" can have on victims.
""Something like this makes you feel completely worthless - people are looking at you and having sexual gratification over you and it's completely out of your control,"" she says.
""It affects you for a really long time, I've always compared it to grief - sometimes you think you're ok and then suddenly you are just in sheds of tears and you just can't help it.""
Since Bear's conviction, Harrison says she's received ""a concerning number of messages"" from other revenge porn victims.
She hopes that the Online Safety Bill, which was put forward by the government in November, is made into law to give further protection to those who have their images or videos shared without consent.
roposes removing part of the current revenge porn law, which was introduced in 2015 and requires the prosecution to show there was intent behind the perpetrator's actions.
""There's no need to say or prove that you intended to cause embarrassment or distress,"" Harrison says.
""Whether you send [a private image] to 10 people or one person, you need to know the effects that that could cause on someone's life - it's going to upset someone, embarrass them and change their life unspeakably,"" she adds.
Bear is due to be sentenced at the end of January and could face prison time.
Campaigners are calling this case one of the highest profile revenge porn convictions of all time in the UK, and there are hopes it could deter people from committing the crime in the future.
""I'd like to potentially speak in schools about my experience, just so that young people can understand the effect these sorts of things can cause to people's lives,"" Harrison says.
""I really want to get across the point that if someone wants to get power over you and they want you to send a picture, then they don't really have respect for you.""
She adds: ""I say to my younger sisters, if someone really cares about you, you won't have to send them something to make them like you."""	/news/entertainment-arts-64030253
sports	Rugby World Cup: The intrigue & inspiration behind first women's tournament of 1991	"Ask anyone with a bit of knowledge about the first women's rugby union World Cup and the myths and legends will flow readily. 
It was only 31 years ago, but memories differ and rumours abound.
One team was supposedly accompanied by KGB agents. Another had to sleep on the floor of a hotel conference room three days before the final. A young baby attended talks with rugby's international governing body as one woman balanced motherhood with organising a major tournament.
It was only nine days long, but the intrigue - as well as its game-changing legacy - has echoed down the decades since.
With the 2022 edition of the World Cup starting on Saturday, now is a good time to look back.
It all started with a meeting.
In 1990, New Zealand had hosted a festival of world rugby, although it could not be classed as a World Cup because of the small number of international sides taking part.
English players were keen for the first World Cup to be closer to home because of travel costs. The simplest solution? To host it themselves, surely.
A volunteer to organise the event was sought and Deborah Griffin - now a legendary name in women's rugby and back then already a leader in the sport - stepped forward.
mpact of that decision is still felt today, but Griffin brushes off notions of grandeur as she laughs a warm but rueful chuckle and simply recalls: ""I must have put my hand up.""
Griffin chose a streamlined team of women to help. In a time before email and ""before we could even patch people into calls"", it was essential that they could work together and meet easily.
So she picked her Richmond club-mates. Alice Cooper would head up the communications, Sue Dorrington led commercial affairs and Mary Forsyth was in charge of finances.
""We weren't daunted because we didn't really know what the problems were,"" Griffin recalls of that time.
It turns out there were many.
first was a tussle with the International Rugby Board, the global governing body for the men's game.
Dr Lydia Furse co-curated an exhibition on the 1991 tournament that is on display at Twickenham Stadium's World Rugby Museum until February. As part of that work, she discovered an ""off the books"" meeting between the IRB and Griffin.
Griffin gave birth to her first child five months before the World Cup was due to take place - a fact she mentions deep into her recollection of events as if it were a minor issue in the whole endeavour.
She was called into the IRB when they got wind of plans for the tournament and took her young daughter Victoria along.
IRB were organising a men's World Cup for later in 1991 and would not officially recognise the women's equivalent. They took issue with similarities between the logos for the two events, as well as the fact Griffin's team were calling it a Rugby World Cup.
""They were kind of told off by this international organisation,"" Dr Furse explains.
""What I love about it is the strength of the organisers to walk out of that meeting and say: 'Why on earth do they think they're in charge of us? We're just going to do it anyway.'""
With a possible threat of solicitors being involved, Griffin and co changed their logo but kept the name, which they felt was sufficiently different because of the inclusion of the word ""Women's"".
Griffin recalls being told by the IRB that they did not want their men's World Cup to be impacted.
""Well how would it?"" she asks now. ""We couldn't understand. I still can't to this day think how it would in any way have impacted on their tournament.""
Dr Furse describes ""apathy and disinterest in women's rugby"" at the time, contrasting with ""amazing energy"" from the organisers.
Back in 1991, Sunday Times journalist Paul Nelson perhaps put it best when he lamented ""the regrettable sniping of men who see the game's development as an intrusion into their territory"".
women stood firm and set their sport on a path that would eventually lead to World Rugby - the modern iteration of the IRB - removing the words 'men's' and 'women's' from World Cup tournament titles in what it called ""the ultimate statement in equality"", in 2019.
Griffin is 63 now and has been involved in the progression of women's rugby almost continuously since 1978. In 2018 she became one of the World Rugby Council's first female members.
She describes the early days of her activism as ""fight, fight, fight"". The IRB was not the only challenge. 
re were seemingly endless bumps in the road.
France confirmed they would take part in the World Cup - scheduled for April - just minutes before the draw took place in February.
New Zealand - called the 'Gal Blacks' at that time - were at the centre of a debate over whether women should perform the Haka with a wide-legged stance.
A sponsorship company had been hopeful of raising £250,000 but instead Griffin says they only got ""a few things in kind"", leaving the organisers short of money. 
And England's players were flying high on the way to the final when the hotel rooms they had been offered for free were suddenly double booked.
""We're three days from the final and we're looking for bed and breakfasts but they allowed us to sleep in sleeping bags in the conference room, it was just a nightmare,"" Dorrington told World Rugbyexternal-link in June.  
Although England's men's union the RFU would offer help later, the separation was such that the 1991 side wore a different rose on their shirts to the men's team - with France and the United States having different logos too.
Some newspapers saw women playing rugby as a novelty. A piece in the Sunday Mirror on 31 March 1991 was headlined 'Scrumptious', with England players posing in evening gowns and the journalist assuring readers the team is ""no macho machine"" and instead ""supremely feminine"".
But it is not entirely a story of misunderstanding, opposition and strife.
Cardiff was chosen as the host city because local authorities offered to pay for a welcoming ceremony and closing dinner.
Vernon Pugh, who would go on to be chairman of the IRB, convinced Welsh clubs to host matches and some male rugby writers took the games seriously.
On the pitch, the Japanese team was a highlight for many. They had never played a Test match before and did not score a single point throughout the tournament.
Instead they drew attention with their reportedly pink scrum caps worn by every player, some standing at 4ft 9in tall, and by bowing to opposition scorers every time a try was conceded.
If Japan was the most heart-warming team, the Soviet Union was the most intriguing.
re had been hints of what was to come when the Soviets attended the 1990 rugby festival in New Zealand. Suspicions were immediately confirmed when the side arrived at Heathrow.
Because of the sponsorship woes, teams were expected to provide their own transport to Cardiff and pay for accommodation and food. The Soviets could not. England player Carol Isherwood drove to their rescue.
A rumour swirling around the tournament also suggests the Soviets' large entourage included KGB agents. Dr Furse stresses that she has not been able to verify that. But one thing that is down in print is a customs debacle surrounding the side. 
Unable to leave their communist homeland with hard cash, the Soviets instead travelled with goods to trade. Apparently this ranged from caviar to Soviet champagne and it is said the side attempted to sell vodka on the steps of Cardiff's City Hall, pushing their luck too far.
Griffin recalls being woken by customs officers at her door and having to go down to the Cardiff Institute, where the Soviet team were staying, to help smooth things over.
Customs were calmed, but tensions sprung up with other teams.
Not allowed to sell their goods, the Soviets were left with no money for food and were said to be ""hoovering up all the breakfast"" at the accommodation they shared with other sides.
World In Their Hands, a book about the tournament written by Martyn Thomas, quotes Soviet coach Vladimir Kobsev as saying at the time: ""We have no money and nothing to eat. It is a desperate situation.
""The girls love rugby and are determined to play well but the danger is that they will be too weak to provide serious opposition. It is tragic, they have all the heart in the world and have saved everything to come to Wales.""
After those words hit the press, the people of Cardiff stepped in to help, with one cafe offering them a daily three-course meal and the local Marks & Spencer providing credit for clothes.
Griffin says: ""The other teams who had also scrimped and saved to get there - most of them were spending their own money, it hadn't been gifted to them by their unions - felt a bit put out. There was a little bit of resentment.""
Like Japan, the Soviet Union did not score a single point at the tournament.
monies from Soviet players at that time have been hard to come by, but Scrum Queens writer John Birch spoke to Larisa Masalova in 2009external-link, who said: ""For most of us it was the first time we travelled abroad or even got passports. We loved that trip.""
Even with all the twists and turns - and despite Griffin's claim that she did not sleep while the tournament was on - the final came around.
United States, bolstered by ""locks from hell"" and ""turbo props"" beat England 19-6 in front of around 3,000 fans.
It was a celebration of what women were capable of on and off the pitch, but one that left organisers £36,000 in debt. First there was the £30,000 owed to a company that had promised big sponsorship returns - which failed to materialise. Then there was the Soviets' accommodation. 
mes rugby correspondent David Hands wrote that there was a ""moral responsibility"" on the men's game to help cover the costs. 
In the end the men's RFU stepped in and told the company asking for £30,000 it would not be paid, before writing a cheque for the remaining £6,000.
upport from the men's governing body was a step in the right direction, but it was not until the turn of the millennium that the women's union was brought into offices at Twickenham and the two organisations only merged as recently as 2012.
Now the RFU is vocal in its support and offers some of the best professional packages in the world.
Yet the journey is not over. England's players may have full-time contracts - putting them ahead of the rest of the world - but they were still expected to fly economy to New Zealand, with current funds for women's rugby limited.
Griffin says ""nowadays there would be a mental health name"" for how she felt after the 1991 tournament, adding: ""I just collapsed afterwards. I hardly saw anybody for six months.""
With World Rugby firmly behind this year's event in New Zealand, it should be a less stressful tournament. It will also provide vindication for Griffin and the other volunteers - proof that their hard work contributed to something bigger. All four of the chief organisers will be inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame and presented to the crowd at the Eden Park semi-finals.
Dr Furse says ""it's hard to understate the importance of 1991"" in women's rugby reaching its current stage. New Zealand's rugby union was one of those that went from opposing the event to welcoming the sport afterwards.
IRB would not recognise the 1994 World Cup either - held in Scotland and won by England - but did eventually take responsibility for the tournament in 1998. The names of the first two winners were finally added to the World Cup trophy in April. 
Griffin says pulling off the 1991 tournament brought about ""a self-belief change"" for those involved.
""I think people realised we weren't going to go away,"" she says. ""It was a case of: 'We're not alone.'""
were definitely not alone: around 3,000 fans attended the 1991 final. With more than 30,000 tickets sold for Saturday's opening match day in Auckland, it is hoped the city's 60,000-seater Eden Park will be full for the tournament decider.
Much has changed since 1991, and Griffin is one of many hoping for more to come in the next three decades."	/sport/rugby-union/63118254
sports	Queen's Birthday Honours: Rio Ferdinand, Gareth Bale, Eve Muirhead and Moeen Ali honoured	"Olympic gold medallist Eve Muirhead has been named on the Queen's Birthday Honours list, alongside cricketer Moeen Ali and ex-footballer Rio Ferdinand.
Muirhead won curling gold at the Beijing Winter Olympics and has been made an OBE, while the rest of her team become MBEs.
Moeen and Ferdinand are both made an OBE, while Wales footballer Gareth Bale becomes an MBE.
Broadcaster Clare Balding and Tracey Crouch MP are both made CBEs.
round of honours are to mark the Queen's Jubilee Birthday celebrations to mark 70 years of service. 
Former sports minister Crouch chaired a fan-led review of football following a number of high-profile crises in the sport, such as the failed European Super League and the collapse of Bury FC. Its primary recommendation to create a new independent regulator for English football has been endorsed by the government.
Balding is recognised for her ability in front of the camera and her charity work. She holds ambassadorial positions with many organisations, including StreetVet and the Helen Rollason Cancer Charity.
Simpson brothers Neil and Andrew are also included on the list of MBEs after both winning gold at the Paralympic Games. 
Younger brother Neil, 19, was guided by brother Andrew, 21, to become GB's third-ever Winter Games gold medallist and the first male to achieve the feat after successes for Kelly Gallagher in 2014 and Menna Fitzpatrick in 2018.
Muirhead's rink defeated Japan to win Team GB's only gold medal in Beijing. Team-mates Vicky Wright, Jen Dodds, Hailey Duff and Mili Smith become MBEs, along with coach David Murdoch.
Scot Muirhead, 32, who has appeared at four Olympics, added to the bronze she won in Sochi in 2014.
England and Worcestershire all-rounder Moeen, 34, announced his retirement from Test cricket in September 2021 but has continued to play for the limited-overs side and was part of the Twenty20 team to reach the semi-finals of last year's World Cup.
He scored 2,914 runs and took 195 wickets in 64 Test matches, having made his debut against Sri Lanka in 2014.
undit and former Manchester United, Leeds, West Ham and England defender Ferdinand is honoured for services to football and charity. He set up the Rio Ferdinand Foundation this year, which works with young people and aids community development.
Snooker players Judd Trump and Mark Selby win recognition too. Former world champion Selby has become an advocate for mental health awareness after admitting his mental health struggles in January. Trump reached the final of this year's World Championship, losing to Ronnie O'Sullivan. 
Wigan Warriors and England rugby league legend Sean O'Loughlin is also included.
Others made an OBE include former England footballers Mike Summerbee and Luther Blissett, who starred for Manchester City and Watford respectively.
Wales and outgoing Real Madrid forward Bale won a joint-record fifth Champions League title on Saturday, albeit having barely featured this season. He spent last season on loan at former club Tottenham.
However, he won three La Liga titles, four Club World Cups, three Uefa Super Cups, one Copa del Rey and three Spanish Super Cups with Madrid, as well as helping Wales to two successive European Championships.
He is joined as an MBE by veteran Liverpool and former England midfielder James Milner.
In the past season Milner helped Liverpool win the FA Cup and League Cup, as well as reach the Champions League final.
Richard Bevan, the chief executive of the League Managers' Association, has also been made an OBE while former Scotland and Hibernian goalkeeper Alan Rough is an MBE.
Husband and wife Neil and Lora Fachie are MBEs after both winning Paralympic cycling gold within the space of 16 minutes.
Neil and pilot Matt Rotherham smashed their own world record to win gold in the B 1,000m time trial, before Lora and Corrine Hall successfully retained their B 3,000m pursuit crown.
Gaz Choudhry, who won Paralympic wheelchair basketball bronze and coached the team in Tokyo and Para-athlete Sammi Kinghorn, a Paralympic silver and bronze medallist, are both made MBEs.
Georgina Harland is also an MBE for her work as the first female chef de mission of the British Olympic Association for the Winter Olympics.
Swimmer Hannah Miley, who represented Britain in swimming at three Olympic Games and won the Commonwealth Games 400m individual medley titles in 2010 and 2014, has also been recognised with an MBE.
Muirhead brought watching British team-mates in the Ice Cube to their feet as she scored a superb four in the seventh end to effectively clinch the Olympic title.
Her performance was the more remarkable for her having returned from hip surgery.
She described the winning moment as a ""dream"" after emulating the gold won by Rhona Howie's team at Salt Lake City in 2002.
Muirhead said: ""There were times during this season that I would never have thought what I managed to go on and achieve was possible.
""I am absolutely delighted to be sharing this honour with my team-mates, because without them there's no way I could have been in this position.""
gold medal capped an incredible 12 months for Muirhead, who led Scotland to eighth at the World Championships last year.
After that disappointment nine players were put into a squad selection process and Muirhead, Wright, Dodds, and Duff emerged. They went on to win the European Championships in December before sealing their spot in Beijing in a tense qualifier just weeks before the Games.
Muirhead added: ""It just goes to show that the team around me never gives up and that you can accomplish anything if you set your mind to it.""
Moeen says he ended his Test career because he found the format ""really difficult to get into"" and ""really long"" - despite having an impressive career and being promoted to vice-captain.
ft-handed batter and off-spinner hit five centuries and took five five-wicket hauls in Tests, finishing with a batting average of 28.29 and a bowling average of 36.66.
Only 15 bowlers have taken more Test wickets for England and Moeen is ranked third among English spinners, behind Derek Underwood (297) and Graeme Swann (255).
""It's an honour to be recognised, it's amazing and my family are really proud and happy,"" he said. ""More than anything, I know it makes my parents happy.""
But he acknowledged his Pakistani heritage and Muslim faith had made him an ambassador for inclusivity in the sport too.
""It's not about runs and wickets. I think it's more about the journey I've been through. It's my background, my upbringing and all those kinds of things I've been through throughout my life.""
In 2017, Moeen became the fifth-fastest player in terms of matches played to reach 2,000 runs and 100 wickets, also taking a hat-trick against South Africa that year to seal a series win at The Oval.
He was part of the 2015 Ashes winning side but struggled during the 2017-18 series in Australia and took a break from cricket after being dropped during the 2019 Ashes at home.

technology	Nigerian TikTokers sentenced to whipping for mocking official	"wo TikTok stars in Nigeria have been sentenced to a whipping and forced to clean the court after they used social media to mock a government official. 
Mubarak Isa Muhammed and Muhammed Bula were found guilty of defaming Abdullahi Ganduje, governor of the northern state of Kano. 
r's lawyer said they would not challenge the judgement. 
Nigeria has seen a growing number of social media stars who use comedy to comment on social and political issues.
Mubarak Isa Muhammad and Muhammad Bala were arrested last week after posting their video - in which they mocked the governor for alleged land grabbing, corruption and sleeping on the job - to TikTok and Facebook.
Prosecution lawyer Wada Ahmed Wada said the men had defamed the governor and that their action was capable of disturbing public peace. 
guilty and asked for leniency, but the judge ordered them to be given 20 lashes each, to pay a fine of 10,000 naira (£20) and to clean the court premises for 30 days. They were also ordered to publicly apologise to Mr Ganduje on social media. 
r lawyer, Bashir Yusuf, told the BBC they would not challenge the judgement, given it was a ''non-custodial'' sentence - meaning those convicted would not be jailed.
Nigeria has seen a rapid increase in TikTok users in recent years, particularly among young people. 
users sometimes mock public figures, including government officials, by clipping images or videos, often to create comedies that attract massive followers to their accounts.

politics	Rishi Sunak criticised for skipping COP27 climate summit	"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has been accused of ""a failure of leadership"" for not attending the COP27 climate summit next month.
Opposition parties and environmental groups said the decision showed the government was not taking the climate crisis seriously enough. 
Downing Street said the PM had ""other pressing domestic commitments including preparations for the autumn Budget"".
Mr Sunak's predecessor Liz Truss had been due to attend the conference.
Environment Secretary Therese Coffey told the BBC she was planning to to attend along with the outgoing Alok Sharma, who was president of last year's COP in the UK.
Defending Mr Sunak's decision, Ms Coffey said the ""big political moments"" tended to happen at the conference every five years - such as last year's summit in Glasgow - and that this year's conference would be more about implementation.
She insisted that ""protecting the planet is absolutely a priority for the government"". 
""We remain committed to net zero and to leading international and domestic action to tackle climate change. The UK is forging ahead of many other countries on net zero,"" she added.
Speaking to LBC, the minister said: ""The UK continues to show global leadership as opposed to just a gathering of people in Egypt."" 
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""Britain showing up to work with world leaders is an opportunity to grasp. Not an event to shun.""
Liberal Democrats also criticised the decision, with leader Sir Ed Davey saying it ""flies in the face of the UK's proud tradition of leading the world in our response to the climate change"". 
Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said the decision made ""a mockery of any government claims on continued climate leadership"".
Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said the move suggests Mr Sunak does not take climate change ""seriously enough"".
COP27 will take place in Sharm el-Sheikh, in Egypt, from 6 to 18 November - finishing the day after Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is due to set out the UK's tax and spending plans. 
ual UN climate summits are designed to help governments agree steps to limit global temperature rises. The UK hosted last year's summit, COP26, in Glasgow and was attended by then-PM Boris Johnson. 
ummit in Egypt is expected to focus on three main areas - reducing emissions, helping countries prepare for and deal with climate change, and securing technical support for developing countries for these activities. 
On Wednesday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told the BBC that he would like to see both the PM and King Charles in attendance. Now it looks like neither will be there. 
Given that the UK government was not just the host of COP26 but the main driving force behind its limited successes, it is unusual that it will not have a major political figure in attendance. 
While Alok Sharma will be there as the outgoing COP president, he is not of the same rank as a prime minister or monarch.
Egyptian organisers will likely be furious at this turn of events - and it will not augur well for the conference if the leaders of one of the world's leading lights in taking action on climate can't prioritise travelling to the gathering. 
More than 200 governments have been invited to COP27. However, some leaders of major economies are not expected to attend, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
US President Joe Biden is planning to go, but China has not yet confirmed if its leaders will participate.  
Earlier this month, Buckingham Palace confirmed King Charles would not be attending the conference.
monarch has a long-standing interest in environmental issues, but the Palace said it had sought advice from then-PM Ms Truss and that ""with mutual friendship and respect there was agreement that the King would not attend"".
Speaking to the BBC on Friday, Ms Coffey said: ""The government doesn't have a view on whether the King should go"" adding that it was ""a matter"" for him.
ws that Mr Sunak will not be attending comes as a UN report warns there is ""no credible pathway"" to keep the rise in global temperatures below a key threshold of 1.5C.
Scientists believe that going beyond 1.5C would see dangerous impacts for people all over the world.
On Wednesday, United Nations secretary general António Guterres told the BBC countries must reprioritise climate change or face catastrophe. 
Meanwhile, No 10 have confirmed Climate Minister Graham Stuart - who was reappointed to the role in Mr Sunak's reshuffle - will no longer attend cabinet,
Last month, under the Truss premiership, the government announced a review of the UK's target to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.
Former Energy Minister Chris Skidmore was tasked with leading the review ""with a focus on ensuring the UK's fight against climate change maximises economic growth, while increasing energy security and affordability for consumers and businesses""."	/news/uk-politics-63418876
entertainment	Black Panther Suffolk exhibition creator wins museum award	"A woman has been recognised for her work on a museum exhibition that features three costumes from the Marvel movie Black Panther.
Elma Glasgow, the founder of Aspire Black Suffolk, won the Museums Association Radical Changemaker award.
It was for her work connecting communities with museums across Suffolk with the Power of Stories exhibition.
She said she was left ""humbled"" by the accolade.
When the exhibition was on show at Christchurch Mansion in Ipswich from June to September 2021, it won temporary exhibition of the year at the Museum and Heritage Awards and attracted more than 24,000 visitors from June to September.
It includes outfits worn by three characters in the film: T'Challa, the Black Panther and king of fictional African country Wakanda, played by the late Chadwick Boseman, his scientific genius sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) and Okoye, Wakanda's military leader (Danai Gurira).
Wakanda Forever, the sequel to Black Panther has been released at cinemas.
judges said: ""Elma's drive to celebrate black heritage in Suffolk has created opportunities for thousands of people to connect, understand, and explore previously excluded histories.""
Ms Glasgow said: ""I'm so humbled but thrilled to win the award.
""Never, in my wildest dreams, did I think I'd be earning a living from work I've been passionate about since my teens: anti-racism and equality. 
""I sincerely hope this national recognition will help Aspire Black Suffolk grow its positive social impact by working with more organisations in the arts, culture, heritage, schools, universities and with clients in other sectors. ""
Power of Stories can be seen at Snape Maltings until 19 February, 2023 and was previously on display at Moyse's Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds and The Food Museum, Stowmarket.

entertainment	Dolly Parton leads tributes to Loretta Lynn	"Dolly Parton has paid tribute to the ""wonderful talent"" Loretta Lynn, following the country music star's death at the age of 90.
""So sorry to hear about my sister, friend Loretta,"" said the singer.
""We've been like sisters all the years we've been in Nashville and she was a wonderful human being.""
Carole King, Carrie Underwood, Billy Ray Cyrus and Jack White have also paid tribute to Lynn, who was best known for the song Coal Miner's Daughter.
White, who recorded an album with the star in 2004, called her both a ""mother figure"" and ""the greatest female singer-songwriter of the 20th century"".
""She was such an incredible presence and such a brilliant genius in ways that I think only people who got to work with her might know about,"" he said in an Instagram video. 
""What she did for feminism, women's rights in a time period, in a genre of music that was the hardest to do it in, is just outstanding and will live on for a long time. 
""She broke down a lot of barriers for people that came after her.""
untry star died on Tuesday at her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee, her family said in a statement.
She built her stardom on music that addressed the struggles of women, at a time when country music often marginalised their voices. Her songs were full of rural pride, determination and autobiographical details from her own, often rocky, marriage.
Her signature song, Coal Miner's Daughter, documented her humble beginnings in a one-room log cabin in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, where she was the second of eight siblings.
Other hits, including The Fist, Rated X and Don't Come Home A-Drinkin', were expressions of female resolve and standing up to unfaithful men.
""Up to now I've been an object made for pleasin' you,"" she sang on 1978's We've Come A Long Way, Baby. ""Times have changed and I'm demanding satisfaction too.""
Some of her songs, in particular The Pill, which celebrated reproductive freedom, upset the conservative programmers of country music radio, but she still scored 16 number one hits, and influenced generations.
""I sure appreciate her paving the rough and rocky road for all us girl singers,"" said country star Reba McEntire on Instagram. 
""She blazed so many trails for all of us girls in country music,"" agreed Miranda Lambert.
""It's safe to say I wouldn't even be making country music today if it weren't for Loretta Lynn,"" added Margo Price. ""Her writing was as real as the day was long.""
Carrie Underwood shared the story of her first encounter with Lynn, at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, in a lengthy Instagram post.
""I was chatting in the corner with another artist and someone walked behind me and smacked me on the rear end!"" she recalled. 
""I turned around and there she was, in a big sparkly dress, laughing as she continued to walk down the hall at what she had just done.
""This is one of my most favourite stories to tell. I think it sums up her personality pretty well. She was a cantankerous little pistol… friendly and sweet… never afraid to be herself and speak her mind.""
Underwood added: ""She is irreplaceable. She will be incredibly missed… but her legacy lives on in those of us whom she has influenced.""
Carole King called Lynn an ""inspiration"" while k.d. lang described her as ""joyous, fierce, one of a kind"".
Billy Ray Cyrus said that ""one of my highest honours"" came when Lynn agreed to duet with him and George Jones on the song Country Music Has The Blues. 
""She handed me this wonderful gift on that day,"" he added, alongside a photo of a signed copy of Lynn's album Van Lear Rose.
Lynn's half-sister and fellow country star Crystal Gayle simply tweeted: ""The world lost a legend. We lost a sister. Love you, Loretta.""

technology	NHS Wales: App helping keep heart patients out of hospital	"Mobile apps to track patients' health are keeping them out of hospital and could cut waiting times, experts have said.
It follows a trial of a new app which heart patients are using through their mobile phones.
rial allows clinicians to change treatments quickly and uses video consultations, avoiding unnecessary hospital visits.
One 80-year-old patient using the app said it was ""brilliant"".
In March, Alun Morgan was told he had heart failure and doctors said stress could be a factor. 
He was placed on the trial to log his weight, blood pressure and the oxygen levels from the comfort of his home. 
""I now appreciate four months on just how many trips to hospital it's saved me,"" the grandfather of seven said.
""As far as I'm concerned I'm on a daily check up without having to move from the house, which is brilliant. 
""If I've got a problem they'll ring me up and say 'look, I'm not happy with that blood pressure reading, can you do it again in an hour'. 
former banker said he finds the technology easy to use, but knows he can call on relatives should he need help.
Rhodri Griffiths is the innovation adoption director at Life Sciences Hub Wales, and is looking for more ways to introduce similar technology.
He believes the pandemic accelerated the use and acceptance of digital solutions in healthcare, by patients and clinicians.
""We really are looking at a big digital revolution within healthcare and there are an amazing myriad of things coming through,"" he said.
He explained data collected by smartphones and watches can help predict who is likely to have a heart attack.
""We can avoid that happening. So prevention is key but it's also looking at how some of this can impact on waiting lists,"" he said. 
""So, looking at how theatres are used, which patients can be prioritised?
""In social care it's looking at how pain is managed by face recognition.
Mr Griffiths said he believed the data collected could also identify wider problems.
""It's combining these digital solutions with our genetic information - bringing big data together on a population level we can start spotting trends. 
""We can start understanding who may be at risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke in the future. 
""Services can be designed around it - there's huge prospects out there.""
However, he warned this would need a lot of investment. 
rt trial app was produced by developers Huma and has been trialled in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Betsi Cadwaladr health board areas.
first evaluation showed a 19% decrease in face-to-face outpatient appointments in Cwm Taf Morgannwg.
In north Wales, 90% of the trial patients who received additional or ""escalated"" care, did so due to data collected by their devices.
Proactive care is believed to reduce the number of patients going to accident and emergency departments.
Latest figures show almost 10,300 people in Wales waited 12 hours or more in A&E in June, technology that cuts those numbers will be welcomed.
Mandie Welch, lead heart failure advanced nurse practitioner at Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, said the technology had already ""facilitated the early discharge of patients from cardiac care units"".
She added it ""allowed us to quickly see the difference medications are making to heart rates and blood pressure"". 
She said: ""Crucially, patients told us that they feel better supported, and having the ability to track their own progress is helping to reassure them and better manage their conditions.
""We've already gone to a patient's home within a day to give them high dose water tablets to get rid of their fluid so they don't come to A&E, and the only reason we know that is because their weight has shot up on the app, and their heart rate has shot up, their symptoms are worse.
""Heart failure is known as the revolving door to A&E, so this app has identified those patients who are getting worse.
""Our main aim is to keep them living longer, to make them feel better and to reduce their readmission rate.""

technology	Molly Russell inquest: Online life was 'the bleakest of worlds'	"father of a 14-year-old who took her own life has told her inquest he was shocked that such ""dark, graphic, harmful material"" was readily available to be seen by children online.
Molly Russell, from Harrow in north-west London, died in November 2017 after seeing content about suicide and self harm.
Ian Russell told North London Coroner's Court he looked at some of his daughter's web history after her death.
He called it ""the bleakest of worlds"".
Mr Russell told the inquest much of the content seemed to ""normalise"" self-harm and suicide and discouraged people to get help with mental health. 
He said relentless images and videos promoted the idea that the world was dark and hopeless. 
""I also looked briefly at Molly's YouTube account and saw a… pattern - many normal teenage 'likes' and 'follows', but a similar high number of disturbing posts concerning anxiety, depression, self harm and suicide.
""On the family computer I saw that Molly continued to receive emails after her death from another social media platform, Pinterest.
""I was shocked to see the subject lines of the emails clearly promoting depressing content.""
Mr Russell earlier told North London Coroner's Court that he hoped Molly's death would remind people that it was ""OK not to be OK"" and to seek help.
He said the family noticed her change during the last year of her life, as she became more withdrawn.
""I knew Molly had an Instagram account and a Twitter account as I also had accounts on these platforms and we 'followed' each other, as did other members of the family.
""Molly closed the Twitter account of hers that we were all following and it was only after her death that I found out she had opened another account on Twitter.""
Mr Russell told the inquest: ""Just as Molly would have wanted, it is important to seek to learn whatever we can and then to take all necessary action to prevent such a young life being wasted again.""
A statement read out to the court on behalf of Molly's mother Janet outlined what happened when she discovered her daughter's body.
Mrs Russell said on the morning of her daughter's death, she was doing household chores and said goodbye to one of her other daughters who was leaving for school, before she began looking around the house for Molly, but could not find her.
Her statement said: ""I knew then something wasn't right. I saw a load of her clothes on the floor (of her bedroom). For some reason I thought Molly had run away.
""As I looked in her room, I found her… I had no doubt it was her.""
In a witness statement read to the court on behalf of retired Metropolitan Police detective Michael Walker, the coroner was told Molly watched videos uploaded by an American social media influencer who spoke about ""suicide and depression on a regular basis"".
urt was told the youngster had also followed a Twitter account which ""displays depressing quotes"".
unt has since been suspended.
Mr Russell said: ""Five years ago, Molly's feelings of worthlessness grew and her sense of helplessness deepened, and ending her life seemed to her like a solution - while to us her life seemed very normal.
""It's all too easy to forget the person she really was: someone full of love and hope and happiness, a young person full of promise and opportunity and potential.
""And so, as this inquest starts, we, her family, think it is essential to remember who Molly really was so we can each hold a picture in our minds of a caring individual, full of love and bubbling with excitement for what should have lay ahead in her life.""
Senior employees from Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, and Pinterest, are due to give evidence in person at Molly's inquest.

technology	Akon’s Wakanda, grazing goats and a crumbling crypto dream	"RnB singer Akon says his much-delayed plans for Akon City - an African metropolis on the Senegalese coast - are ""100,000% moving"". 
Although goats are currently grazing on the site, he says that critics will look ""super stupid"" in the future.
In an exclusive interview with the BBC, the Smack That singer also assured supporters waiting for refunds from his Token of Appreciation cryptocurrency campaign that they will receive their money back, even if he has to pay them out of his own pocket.
Widely known for his string of noughties chart hits Akon, who was born in the United States but partly raised in Senegal, announced two ambitious projects in 2018 that were supposed to represent the future of African society. 
first was a reported $6bn (£5bn) city with boldly curvaceous skyscrapers. It was to run on the second initiative - a brand new cryptocurrency called Akoin. 
But several years on both projects have faced difficulties and delays and the site where the city is proposed to be built remains a waste ground.
On an overcast day in September 2020 Akon, dressed in a powder blue suit, strode confidently onto a dusty red patch of disused land. There to meet him was a gaggle of journalists from around the world who had assembled for the hitmaker's latest launch: a supercity packed with stunning architecture.
Local people clapped as a veil was pulled back on a plaque marking the future building site. But two years on the question of whether the plans will ever come to fruition divides communities in the region.
""We thought we could work on it but at this pace, maybe our children will,"" one resident of the area tells the BBC. ""We remain hopeful for the project. We hope that our children will stay here to work.""
Another resident says they no longer believe in the project before adding ""when it comes, if it finds us here, we'll see how we can contribute"". 
Akon City was initially compared in the press with Wakanda, the amazing African metropolis featured in the Black Panther movies and comic books. Phase one of the city containing roads, a campus, a mall, residences, hotels, a police station, a school, a waste facility and a solar power plant was supposed to be complete by the end of 2023. But after multiple delays, little on the ground appears to have changed since the launch ceremony.
""I'm only here in the presence of goats"" local journalist Borso Tall tells me. ""It's completely empty... no sign of building just a long line of green trees and red earth.""
But Akon remains adamant that his ambitious plans will still be realised.
When we meet in central London, he admits that with hindsight ""I would have gotten more things in place before promoting it."" 
He also blames Covid, which he says meant ""everything would be pushed back two years"".
However, the world was already in the grip of the pandemic when he held the ceremony promoting Akon City to international media in August 2020. 
""I plan to retire in that city,"" he says confidently. ""I don't like to use the word the king of the city. But that's what it will turn out to be.""
""We're trying to get the city built as fast as possible,"" he says, adding that he has a lease on the land for the next 50 years and that his project has ""been co-signed by the current president"". 
Senegalese government's tourist board SAPCO recently reaffirmed their commitment to the project. 
""We believe in Akon city and we are all supporting Akon so the Akon city will come to life,"" said Me Aliou Sow, CEO of SAPCO. ""It will attract tourists and investors in the region and SAPCO is fully committed to the success of this project.""
Akon says he has changed both the construction firms and architects he is working with on the project, adding that his new partners understand Africa, the terrain and have ""real credibility globally"". His overall goals remain ambitious. 
""We want the big skyscrapers. My goal is to try to build something that people deem impossible in Africa, right?""
Several celebrity finance websites estimate Akon's net worth to be between $60-80m, leading some to question where the money will come from for a project of this size. His team claim they have an international consortium in place who will fund it with private investment. 
Akon said that excavation work on the site will finally start before the end of the year, adding that further announcements will be made at a youth centre he has built for residents in a local village. Construction work on Akon City he acknowledges ""is yet to be fully calendered"". 
for Akon City, dubbed it ""Crypto City"" and in August 2020 Akon said the city's financial infrastructure would be ""built off"" his own Akoin cryptocurrency. But the cryptocurrency has been plagued by its own delays and struggles. 
""It wasn't being managed properly,"" he concedes. ""I take full responsibility for that.""
Before launching his Akoin cryptocurrency, the Akoin website announced a pre-sale opportunity called the Token of Appreciation (TOA) campaign. 
mpaign was announced over two years before the Akoin cryptocurrency itself was available. It was a fundraiser to cover the costs of launching Akoin later down the line.  
Money sent for TOAs was framed as a ""donation"" on the Akoin TOA website page but there was a special incentive to put money in during this period. Contributors were told that for every $1 they put in they would receive up to four Tokens of Appreciation which would later convert to proper Akoin.
""I did genuinely believe in the ecosystem that they were looking to build,"" says Marcus (not his real name) who lives in the UK. ""Every now and again I'd put in a few thousand pounds.""
ken of Appreciation campaign concluded in October 2019. The official Akoin Twitter feed claimed it had raised $290,000. Over two years later TOA donors were presented with a choice in the official Akoin Telegram group.
""We're now able to give TOA holders a choice,"" wrote the admin. ""Receive a refund of their original donation or receive an Akoin MasterCard which will have the value of their initial donation.""
Some TOA donors have decided to wait for their promised rewards. For now they have notice of a Token of Appreciation but it doesn't have any functionality. Others have tried to claim their money back.
""I didn't ask for the refund, they offered the refunds,"" notes Marcus, whose faith in the project was starting to flag. ""The refund was meant to come a few weeks later. We are now over a year. And we're back at the same situation we were years ago with the lack of communication and now everybody's up in arms.""
Marcus is not alone. In the Akoin Telegram groups I've spoken to a number of other people around the world who say that they have asked for refunds but are still waiting to receive their money back. 
""It's extremely frustrating,"" says Reggie, an American living in Asia who also donated to the campaign. ""Yeah, I've gotten upset about this, you know, a number of times.""
I put cases like Marcus' and Reggie's to Akon, who denied knowing that donors to the Akoin campaign were still waiting for refunds. He claims he will get involved in rectifying the situation until TOA donors are happy. 
""Even if I gotta go in my own pocket,"" he adds. ""I'm dead serious. I would do a world tour just to pay them all back.""
Akon: 'I would do a world tour' to pay back crypto investors
Akoin cryptocurrency itself launched on Bitmart in September 2021. Its value at that time was £0.23 ($0.28) but it has fallen significantly since, preceding a crash in the wider cryptocurrency market. Today Akoin's price is just £0.01.
re have also been questions over whether it would even be legal for Akoin to operate as the primary payment method at Akon City.
urrent legal tender in Senegal is the CFA franc, which is regulated and issued by Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), which share the money. Yahoo Finance reported last year that the ""institution warned of the dangers of adopting cryptocurrency and termed it illegal"". We approached the BCEAO to comment on the legality of a city running on cryptocurrency but they didn't respond. 
""Those are a lot of the concerns even I have,"" acknowledges Akon. ""I want to make sure that however we involve crypto within the city is in a way that it lines up with all the rules and regulations.""
So will ordinary transactions in Akon's proposed ""Crypto City"" still take place with his own crypto? It seems unclear. ""We'll have it figured out by the time the city's up, that's for sure,"" he promises.
But after two years of waiting, not everyone is convinced.
""I think a lot of us we've done our research but it panned out like nothing is going on,"" says Reggie. ""I would like to get my funds back and just walk away"".

business	Why chicken is getting more and more expensive	"Chicken is the UK's meat of choice for the dinner table, but consumers might have noticed the numbers ticking up on their receipts.
With the cost of chicken feed, energy and transport increasing, fast food chains like Nando's and KFC have already put some prices up. 
f Co-op supermarkets has warned poultry could become as expensive as beef, while official figures suggest that the price of chilled, oven-ready, chicken has increased from £2.50 to £3 per kg in the last two years.
""The problem we have is that all kinds of prices are going up and up,"" says poultry farmer James Mottershead.
His family bought the West Midlands farm in 2001. 
In recent years, demand has grown and the business now raises about 1.5 million chickens a year.
We follow the production process step-by-step to see where costs are mounting for poultry farmers and processors.
Poultry makes up 50% of the meat eaten in the UK and one billion birds are reared in the country every year, according to the British Poultry Council.
Mr Mottershead, who is also the chair of the poultry board at the National Farmers' Union, receives deliveries of about 215,000 chicks in seven ""cycles"" each year.
roiler chickens, raised specifically for meat, arrive at the farm at one day old.
rice for the chicks has gone up by 5p over the last year though, with the cost now topping 40p per bird, Mr Mottershead says.
Hatcheries have come under pressure as costs for feed, electricity and heating for the incubation period have gone up, and those are being passed on to farms.
Mr Mottershead and two dedicated full-time employees look after the chicks that are then grown in dedicated poultry sheds.
Day-to-day costs are going up there too.
Staff start on-site at 07:00, checking water consumption and feed availability, as well as on the birds' health.
All of the birds on the farm are sold as Red Tractor assured, which means each chicken can be traced back to the hatchery it came from and it has 10% more space than is required by European legislation.
farm generates renewable energy. The commercial sheds use LED lights and have solar panels on the roof. Despite that, Mr Mottershead says electricity prices have ""rocketed"" in the last year, with the cost per kilowatt roughly doubling. 
Some of the sheds also have LPG gas containers for heating. Prices now top 40p per litre, up from 15p two years ago - driven higher by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and worries about the impact the conflict could have on supplies from one of the world's biggest gas exporters.
farm uses borehole water, but the cost of chemicals used to sanitise the water has risen by about 30%.
usiness also goes through about 200 tonnes of wood shavings for the chick's bedding each year. The cost of buying that in bulk has jumped by about 40% in the last 12 months.
Aside from wood shavings to scratch, the cost of feed, which makes up a large proportion of a poultry farmer's budget, is soaring.
farm's spend on it now stands at about £2m a year. Different types of feed ingredients are used depending on the chicken's stage in its life cycle - whether that's a chick crumb or a grower pellet for later on.
Kynan Massey, managing director of Massey Bros feed firm, told the BBC ""prices had never been higher"".
It's because the feed is often made up of wheat or soya, which have seen prices spike due to failed harvests last summer and the conflict in Ukraine.
""Russia and Ukraine are responsible for a quarter of wheat exported around the world,"" Mr Massey says. ""If conflict continues we could see prices carrying on rising, and in Europe the dry weather is affecting costs as well."" 
In the poultry sheds, the birds' weight is monitored regularly.
umber of birds is reduced at 32 days once they have reached their target weight to ensure the farm is meeting rules on density per square metre. 
About a third of birds in the shed are sent to the abattoir then, with the rest of the chickens removed at 39 days.
re transported by truck in crates. Of course, the cost of fuel has also gone up.
UK diesel prices, for example, rose to a record of just over £1.80 a litre on Monday, according to the RAC.
After the previous record of £1.79 in March following the invasion of Ukraine, prices dipped but have risen again in recent weeks.
And it's been more difficult to find a lorry driver. The shortage has been blamed on a combination of factors, including the pandemic, Brexit and tax changes. 
Wages have soared as a result, with annual salaries offered by some haulage firms reaching £80,000.
""The reality is that when you have a shortage, people can name their prices,"" Mr Mottershead says.
In UK processing plants, most chickens are now killed using gas - usually carbon dioxide, a by-product from the fertiliser production process.
Gas prices were already going up last year, forcing big fertiliser factories in the UK to suspend production.
Although the UK produces about half of its own fertiliser, costs have been driven up more because of conflict further afield. 
Russia is a huge producer of the key ingredients needed for fertiliser, like ammonia, so fears over supplies have a knock-on effect on CO2 prices.
2 Sisters, one of the UK's biggest chicken suppliers, told the BBC it had seen the cost of CO2 nearly quadruple.
After the chickens are killed, they are defeathered, cleaned and packaged by agricultural workers. 2 Sisters says the cost of card packaging has also gone up by 20% in recent months. 
Producers are spending more on labour in the plants due to an increase in the National Minimum Wage as well. Others are offering higher salaries to attract workers amid ongoing labour shortages.
Eventually, the packaged chicken will be sold to clients like butchers, corner-shop chains, manufacturers or supermarkets.
But Ronald Kers, the boss 2 Sisters, has said input costs before this point have rocketed. 
""Prices from the farm gate have already risen by almost 50% in a year,"" the company which has 600 farms and 16 factories across the UK, said previously.
It warned the days of lower prices are coming to an end.
Mr Mottershead points out that although some poultry producers are struggling, supermarkets are hesitant to pass on costs to their customers as the cost of living increases.
""We're doing all we can to produce quality chicken and egg products, but there's a huge amount of farmers who won't be able to restock their sheds because that cost is too great,"" he says.
Russia's war in Ukraine has made existing shortages ""even worse"", he suggests.
For poorer families and countries, ""the realities of this don't bear thinking about"". "	/news/business-61466479
technology	Shetland communication restored after subsea cable damage	"Internet and phone services have been restored in Shetland after two subsea cables were damaged.
A break in the lines connecting Shetland to the mainland led police to declare a major incident on Thursday.
Broadband and mobile connections have been reinstated through a temporary fix as engineers continue repairs, BT said.
Cable operator Faeroese Telecom said the damage, which is not expected to be fully repaired until next week, was likely caused by fishing vessels.
ubsea cable connecting Shetland and the Faroe Islands was damaged last week, with a separate cable linking Shetland with the Scottish mainland also being cut on Thursday.  
BT Group, which provides communications services through the cables, said engineers had been working ""flat out"" to repair the damage – which had primarily impacted mobile and broadband connections. 
A spokesperson said: ""While both cable links are being repaired by subsea engineers, engineers were able to reconnect all services via a temporary solution on Thursday afternoon. 
""Further testing and monitoring overnight has shown that broadband services have remained stable, and we will continue to monitor this. 
""As a precaution, we have specialist teams in Shetland with satellite backup links should either of the subsea cables fail while they are being repaired.""
All landline services, which were largely unaffected, have also been restored. 
Faeroese Telecom's head of infrastructure, Páll Vesturbú, said the damage to the mainland link, which happened just after midnight on Thursday, had affected the fibres in the cable, but ""they were not cut off"".
""We have reason to believe that the cable was damaged by a fishing vessel,"" he said.
""There was also an incident last week, and we also believe that this was caused by a fishing vessel.""
BBC Shetland's office in Lerwick reported on Thursday evening that broadband was returning to parts of the islands, with 4G signals also available on EE and Vodafone networks.
Mr Vesturbú added: ""We expect that the repair of the cable fault that happened last week will be finalized on Saturday and the repair of the damage that happened after midnight will be fully repaired again next week.""
With many landlines and mobiles not usable, police increased patrols on Thursday to reassure residents.
Modern submarine cables use fibre optic technology and are typically as wide as a garden hose, according to telecoms market research firm TeleGeography.
Lasers on one end fire at rapid rates down thin glass fibres to receptors at the other end of the cable. These glass fibres are wrapped in layers of plastic - and sometimes steel wire - for protection. 
Cables lie on the ocean floor, while nearer to the shore they are buried under the seabed for additional protection.
firm said ""considerable care"" was taken to make sure cables avoid fishing zones, anchoring areas and other dangers.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had described the situation as an emergency for the islands, with the Scottish government's resilience committee meeting to discuss the issues and ensure the necessary support was provided.
Ms Sturgeon said the assumption was the damage was accidental, adding: ""There is nothing to suggest otherwise, but work is continuing to assess exactly what the cause of the problem has been.""
Orkney and Shetland MP Alastair Carmichael said on Thursday that he had raised the issue with the UK government.
He said the priority was fixing the issue but that resilience would also need to be looked at in future.
Homes and businesses were affected across the archipelago, which is 130 miles (210 km) from the Scottish mainland and has a population of about 23,000.
However, flights to Sumburgh Airport and Serco NorthLink ferry services to the islands were unaffected.
Emergency services also had to implement temporary back-up arrangements.
Karen Arellano, owner of No88 Bar and Kitchen in Lerwick, said the business faced ""huge difficulties"" on Thursday. Its tills and booking system relies on an internet connection. 
She said staff had to turn away customers who did not have enough cash.
""Unfortunately yesterday's circumstances dictated that nobody could go anywhere to get any cash,"" Ms Arellano told BBC Scotland. 
""And with circumstances as they are at the moment, most people aren't carrying wads of cash around with them.""
Roy Mullay, a shop assistant at marine supplies firm LHD Limited in Lerwick, said the outage caused ""massive disruption for the whole day"".
""We had no tills so everything was recorded with notepad and pen,"" he told BBC Scotland.
""We had several people come in and realise they couldn't pay with the money they had. We couldn't even send them to the bank either because the ATMs weren't operational and the banks had closed their doors.""
Local author and anthropologist Catherin Munro said the incident had reinforced the importance of the ""fragile"" technology that connects the islands with the mainland. 
Posting on Twitter after Prime Minister Liz Truss announced her resignation, the author wrote: ""Did I miss much?""
She added: ""It was a very unsettling day. They had predicted several days to fix phone and internet services. 
""Card payment wasn't possible in shops, banks and ATM couldn't give cash and emergency vehicles patrolled. 
""In an emergency, islanders were advised to try and flag one down."""	/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-63337473
politics	NI Protocol: Medicine supply still faces 'significant issue'	"re are still unresolved issues with the Northern Ireland Protocol despite changes made by the EU, says a major pharmaceutical firm. 
Earlier this year, the EU altered its laws in a move aimed at guaranteeing the supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.
However, Teva says there is still one ""very significant"" issue related to the continued supply of some drugs.
firm has raised the matter in a consultation on the NI Protocol Bill. 
rotocol is the post-Brexit trading deal agreed by the UK and the EU in 2019. 
UK plans to use the Protocol Bill to override most of the agreement if the EU does not agree to changes.
rotocol means Northern Ireland is still inside the EU's pharmaceutical regulatory system.
However, it gets most of its medicines from Great Britain, which is not.
merged as one of the protocol's major difficulties, with pharmaceutical firms warning it would lead to withdrawal of products.
EU accepted it was a problem and in April changed its laws so that medicines entering NI from GB will not need additional labelling or testing, things which would have been required by the protocol in its original form.
removed the ""most onerous regulatory burdens arising from the protocol"" and allowed it to continue supplying medicines to NI without additional complexities.
firm says the current problematic issue is the treatment of so-called Centralised Procedure (CP) product licences.
It says that in order to continue to supply products approved via the CP route in NI, an EU authorisation is required, so a company needs to have two different product licences, one covering GB and one covering NI.
firm adds that it has been clear that any situation that leads to the need for two product licences ""creates an administrative and cost burden that will make many medicines unviable to supply to NI"".
urrently supplies about 630 products to NI, 48 of which have CP licences.
It says it believes the full impact of the CP issue is yet to be seen and it will be making decisions based on current market share and historical sales. 
Separately, a body which represents businesses providing over-the-counter medicines has also raised the CP issue.
PAGB says a way needs to be found to ensure medicines licenced via the CP route can be sold in both GB and NI as a single pack, without divergence in the licences behind them.
Like Teva the PAGB says the issue ""can and should be resolved via negotiations"".
Meanwhile, concerns have also been raised about how the government's replacement plan for the protocol would work in respect of medicines.
Part of the government's plan is for a dual regulatory regime, which would mean goods made to either EU or UK standard could be sold in Northern Ireland.
""in theory"" it could be supportive of a dual regulatory regime as it should allow UK-wide licencing.
However, in its view for a dual regime to be attainable, there ""could be no divergence between UK and EU regulations. As soon as there is any divergence then this becomes extremely problematic"".
Asked about negotiations over the protocol on Wednesday, Sinn Féin vice-president Michelle O'Neill urged the UK and the EU to ""get on with it"".
Meanwhile the Nuffield Trust, a health think tank, says the dual regime would ""create a very complex situation"".
""Pharmacists and doctors would be prescribing and dispensing drugs approved and tested under two different systems, with different mechanisms for detecting falsified medicines,"" it added."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63642950
politics	Deaths in Scottish prisons at record high	"Stuart Allan says the impact of the death of daughter Katie in prison has been massive
A record number of people have died in Scottish prisons in the past three years.
A report, by academics at Glasgow University, shows there have been 121 deaths since the start of 2020, with suicide and drugs deaths on the rise.
rate of suicide and drugs deaths in Scottish jails is significantly higher than in England, the report said. 
Scottish Prison Service said it worked to give people the best possible care and wellbeing. 
w report, seen by the BBC, studied data going back to 1995.
It said the 121 people who died in prison in Scotland between the start of 2020 and September this year compared with 98 in the previous three full years.
Covid played a role in the record-breaking number of prison deaths, with 15 prisoners dying from the virus, but deaths from other medical conditions have held fairly steady while drugs fatalities and people taking their own lives have been on the rise.
re have been 29 deaths by suicide and 25 from drugs since the start of 2020, with a further eight whose cause is undetermined, which could add to the drugs toll.
mics said deaths from suicide and drugs were typically ""from distress and loss of hope"", which are of particular concern when assessing prison regimes and conditions
report said a person who was imprisoned in 2022 in Scotland would be twice as likely to die in jail as someone in 2008.
Prof Sarah Armstrong, one of the lead authors of the report, said: ""We don't have a death penalty anymore in this country and yet for many people - more than 100 - going to prison is a death sentence. 
""We are talking about people who are entirely dependent on the state to live. 
""People in prison won't get food, won't get healthcare or shelter unless the state does its job. 
""And when you have such a high rate of death in prison - and a higher suicide rate and drug death rate than in English prisons - real questions are raised about the quality of that care.""
rison service introduced its suicide prevention strategy called Talk To Me six years ago.
mics found that there had been a 42% increase in suicides since the strategy was introduced compared with the six previous years.
Katie Allan was a third year student at Glasgow University when she was jailed for a hit and run incident. She was just 21 when she took her own life in Polmont in 2018. 
Her mother Linda Allan, who is an academic and co-author of the report, said: ""People in prison are being failed by the state and losing their lives in the care of the state. And very often - in our opinion - that is avoidable."" 
Katie's father Stuart said there had been more than 50 suicides in Scottish jails since his daughter died. 
""The impact on us has been massive,"" he said. 
""You don't go a day or a moment in the day without thinking about Katie."" 
Mr Allan said he lived his life battling to get a justification for why Katie died and to make sure it did not happen to other people who found themselves in the prison service.
Fatal Accident Inquiries (FAIs) are meant to ensure an effective investigation into deaths and accountability but the report said they were failing to do that. 
It found that, on average, FAIs into prison deaths took more than two years to complete and almost never made any recommendations or offered points of learning for the prison service. 
One inquiry published earlier this year took more than four years and made no findings beyond time, place and cause of death. 
report highlighted cases where prisoners died arguably preventable deaths, including one man who died from psoriasis after waiting months for medical treatment. 
It also highlighted inmates who took their own lives after not being placed on suicide watch despite a history of self-harm. 
report said: ""One year has passed since we reported that deaths have been rising in Scottish prisons, and that FAIs to investigate these take a significant amount of time only to determine no changes are needed. 
""Since then, deaths have continued to rise, accelerating during the pandemic for reasons beyond Covid, and FAIs are continuing to take years with the same low rate of determining nothing could be done, or can be done.""
Scottish government-commissioned Independent Review of the Response to Deaths in Custody, published 12 months ago, emphasised ""the human rights obligation of the state to carry out an effective investigation into death and ensure accountability where state responsibility arises"".
Scottish government accepted the recommendation and set up a deaths in custody action group - but since then the rate of deaths has increased. 
A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said: ""We recognise the profound emotional distress experienced by families when a loved one dies in custody.""
He said the prison service wanted people to have the best possible health and wellbeing and was working closely with the NHS and charities on suicide prevention.
Earlier this year, the prison service said the most common way to smuggle psychoactive substances into jails was by spraying them on to pieces of paper posted to prisoners.
SPS spokesman said preventative measures such as photocopying mail had led to a significant fall in illicit substance misuse.
He also said that there are increasing numbers of older people in prison, with the same health and care challenges as the wider community.
A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The safe treatment and mental health of all those in custody is a key priority for Scotland's prisons, which care for people with higher levels of risk and vulnerability than the general population as a whole.
""The Crown Office has significantly reformed its processes to reduce the time taken to investigate deaths and to bring FAIs to court more quickly. It is for the presiding sheriff, who has heard all the evidence, to determine what recommendations, if any, should be made."""	/news/uk-scotland-63780998
sports	Stephen Jones and Gethin Jenkins leave Wales coaching roles	"Wales coaches Stephen Jones and Gethin Jenkins are to leave their roles after Warren Gatland decided they will not be part of his new backroom staff.
Gatland replaced Wayne Pivac as Wales head coach earlier this month and has been assembling his coaching team.
Attack coach Jones and defence expert Jenkins follow Pivac out of the door but forwards coach Jonathan Humphreys will keep his job.
Kicking coach Neil Jenkins is also to remain in the set-up.
Former Wales attack coach Rob Howley, currently involved in the Canadian coaching set-up, has been touted for a reunion with Gatland in his second stint in charge.
Ex-England defence coach Paul Gustard, currently employed by Stade Francais, is another who has been linked with the new Wales set-up, while former Wales flanker Jonathan Thomas is also tipped to be in contention for a role.
Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) say the search is ongoing for new attack and defence coaches, with both positions expected to be filled in January.
""We are delighted both Jonathan and Neil will stay on and be a part of Warren's new team,"" said WRU chief executive Steve Phillips.
""The very nature of a changeover at the helm of a national team brings with it the possibility for change and evolution elsewhere in the backroom staff.
""I know both Stephen and Gethin understand this part of the process and they should be commended for the good grace with which they have accepted the decision. 
""We have appointed a very experienced and senior head coach, one of the best coaches in the world game and Wales' most successful ever coach, and it is important to now ensure he is afforded the very best opportunity to succeed.  
""That means giving our maximum support as Warren seeks to build the right team around him - with the right blend of skills and character to suit his own style - to achieve success for Wales in the short amount of time available and we look forward to making further positive appointments in the new year.""
Jones started in the Wales set-up under Gatland after being a late replacement before the 2019 World Cup in Japan for Howley, who was sent home before the tournament because of betting offences he had committed.

gh point of Jones' involvement in the national coaching set-up was in the 2021 Six Nations triumph, when Wales scored a record 20 tries.

After coaching spells with Cardiff RFC and Wales Under-20s, Jenkins replaced Sam Warburton and joined Pivac's backroom staff in 2020 to work alongside Byron Hayward.
When Hayward was dismissed, Jenkins was given the defence coach job on a permanent basis ahead of the 2021 Six Nations."	/sport/rugby-union/64106202
entertainment	Coventry pays tribute to Terry Hall of The Specials	"ributes have been paid to ska legend Terry Hall, with calls for a permanent memorial in Coventry, where he was born.
Specials front man, who died on Monday, grew up in the city, where the band formed in the late 1970s.
wo Tone music movement he helped pioneer is embedded in Coventry's musical heritage. 
Overhead gantries on the city's ring road were changed to read ""too much, too young, RIP Terry Hall"".
""Thank you for the memories"", was also posted on a promotional sign outside music venue HMV Empire.
Singer-songwriter Hall lived in Hillfields and went to Sidney Stringer school before joining The Specials in 1977.
Phil Rooney, HMV Empire manager, said there should be a permanent tribute to hall in the city, such as a statue.
""Terry was a very important part of Coventry's music history, world music history possibly,"" he added. ""I think we genuinely need to have a Specials day in Coventry, they have one in LA.""
""I saw your Terry Hall message on the ring road yesterday and it gave me a tear in my eye,"" wrote one Facebook user in response to the city council's post about the gantries. ""Beautiful touch to our Cov kid,"" said another.
Bandmate Horace Panter confirmed his friend had been diagnosed with cancer shortly before his death - with pancreatic cancer spreading to his liver.
Dean of Coventry Cathedral, the Very Reverend John Witcombe, said he had ""such warm memories of Terry"" from the band's homecoming gigs in the Cathedral ruins three years ago.
A tribute on the cathedral's Facebook page said the shows captured ""the very essence of Coventry, and will not be forgotten"".
John Dawkins, manager of Tom Grennan, tweeted that the Coventry City team should wear its Two Tone kit for tonight's fixture against West Brom as a sign of respect to the ""icon"".
m responded to say it was unable to wear the kit, but would be playing music from The Specials and putting pictures on the big screen at Wednesday's game against West Brom.
""I always talk [to my artists] about trying to affect popular culture in a positive way and I don't think anyone's done it quite as well as Terry has,"" he said. 
Pete Chambers from Coventry Music Museum, meanwhile, described Hall as ""unique"".
""There wouldn't be a Coventry Music Museum if we didn't have The Specials and the Two Tone movement in the city,"" he said. ""The Two Tone movement really resonated and still does to this day and Terry was a huge part of that.""
Coventry's Lord Mayor Councillor Kevin Maton called Hall a ""true Coventrian"".
""Not only was he a talented songwriter and inspiring performer who undertook a number of musical projects, he was a leading light for many in the fight for equality and justice,"" he said.

politics	Rishi Sunak urges allies to boost Ukraine support	"Rishi Sunak has urged European allies to maintain or boost military support for Ukraine over the coming year.
PM kicked off a trip to the Baltic region by announcing the UK would send hundreds of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition to Ukraine. 
He also said there could not be peace talks until Russia withdrew its troops.
Last week, the BBC reported that the prime minister had asked for an assessment of the progress of the war in Ukraine. 
A Whitehall source told BBC's Newsnight programme: ""Wars aren't won [by dashboards]. Wars are won on instinct. At the start of this it was Boris (Johnson) sitting down and saying: 'Let's just go for this.' So Rishi needs to channel his inner Boris on foreign policy though not of course on anything else.""
Downing Street has insisted Mr Sunak is strongly supportive of Ukraine.
During his trip to eastern Europe, the prime minister also met British troops serving in the Nato military alliance. 
He served mince pieces to soldiers in Estonia and praised their ""selfless dedication and bravery"".
Over the past year, the UK has doubled its presence in the country in response to the build up of Russian troops in Ukraine.
Earlier in the day, Mr Sunak had attended a meeting of the leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Forces (JEF) - a coalition of northern European countries, including Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Latvia.
Addressing the gathering in the Latvian capital Riga, Mr Sunak said it was an ""incredibly important"" time for them to reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine. 
""We must be clear that any unilateral call for a ceasefire by Russia is completely meaningless in the current context.
""I think it would be a false call, it would be used by Russia to regroup, to reinforce their troops and until they have withdrawn from conquered territory, there can and should be no real negotiation.
""But what we can do is think about that time now, think about what we will do with regard to security assurances.""
He added that the group should concentrate on ""degrading Russia's capability to regroup and resupply"".
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky also addressed the meeting, albeit over video link rather than in person. 
He said providing Ukraine with a ""100% air shield"" would be ""one of the most successful steps"" countries could take against Russia. 
He added that Russian missiles had left millions in his country without heat or power. 
Following the summit, Mr Sunak met his Latvian counterpart Krisjanis Karins for talks, during which the pair agreed to work to accelerate trade between their countries. 
Mr Karins tweeted: ""As close and likeminded allies our countries have a shared commitment to regional security and a strong stance in support of Ukraine. Glad we also got to discuss strengthening of economic & high-tech links.""
Mr Sunak then headed to Estonia where he signed a technology partnership with the country's Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas, aimed at improving cooperation on cyber security, connectivity and data."	/news/uk-politics-64027987
technology	Haworth: 'Imposing' phone mast for historic village refused	"A 5G phone mast will not be allowed to be built in a West Yorkshire village because it would add an ""imposing modern element.""
CK Hutchinson Networks submitted plans to Bradford Council for a 60ft (18m) mast on Vale Mill Road, Haworth.
But Bradford Council has rejected the application, saying it would have a ""deleterious impact on the living conditions of nearby residents"". 
It would be ""overbearing"" and would ""dominate the area"", the council said.
Proposals put forward by CK Hutchinson Networks said the mast would fill a 5G ""coverage hole"" in the village.
Haworth, Cross Roads and Stanbury Parish Council had initially opposed the plan, saying the location, on a residential street, was ""wholly inappropriate for such equipment.""
mpany argued the mast was needed to provide good 5G signal in Haworth, and said there were already other elements of street furniture such as lampposts on the street.
But planning officers said the proposal would add an ""imposing modern element which would be visually jarring and detrimental to the character of the area"".
Local Democracy Reporting Service said officers had acknowledged there was a ""coverage hole"" in the location and agreed the pole would have extended 5G service across the area.
However, they said the ""siting and appearance of the mast"" would cause ""unacceptable harm to the visual amenity of the locality.""

business	Energy use advice campaign pulled due to cost, Zahawi says	"Watch: Blackouts extremely unlikely - Zahawi
A public information campaign to help people reduce energy bills this winter was pulled by No 10 on the grounds of cost, a cabinet minister has said.
mpaign to encourage household energy saving would have cost up to £15m, Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.
PM's office raised objections to the plan, the BBC reported on Friday.
And asked about the possibility of winter blackouts, Mr Zahawi said these were ""very unlikely"". 
Amid concerns about rising household energy costs, the government has said it would limit average bill rises to £2,500 through government borrowing, at a cost of £60bn for six months. 
rgy and cut costs, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) had been preparing a public information campaign.
But Prime Minister Liz Truss is reported to have been ""ideologically opposed"" to the campaign, fearing it would be too interventionist.
Cabinet minister Mr Zahawi, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, told the BBC that the campaign would have cost up to £15m, and denied that it being dropped indicated the government was divided.
He said such a campaign was unnecessary because the National Grid, which distributes energy across the UK, and regulator Ofgem were running similar campaigns.
""What the prime minister quite rightly [...] has done is to say: 'We don't need to spend £14m or £15m on another campaign, if National Grid and Ofgem are doing that work',"" he said.
Mr Zahawi said that information on saving energy was also already on UK government websites.
""That is, I think, being prudent with taxpayers' money. It isn't a divide,"" he said. 
Following a warning from National Grid that UK households could lose power for up to three hours at a time this winter, Mr Zahawi said that scenario was ""very unlikely"".
""I'm confident that the resilience is there, that people can enjoy their Christmas,"" he said.
Martin Pibworth, a managing director at energy firm SSE, said that investment the UK had made in renewables ""gives us a little bit more security of supply compared with our European neighbours"".
He said the ""weaponisation of gas supplies by the Putin regime is clearly quite a big issue in terms of the [market] volatility that is being caused"".
But he said there are other risk factors including French nuclear generation being lower than normal, and the drought affecting Europe this summer having had an impact on hydro-electric power.
However, he said ""what protects the UK a bit more is renewable investments it has made historically, and actually this is a great opportunity to think how we can increase those investments to get better energy security going forward"".
Ms Truss has pledged to beef up the UK's energy security by speeding up the deployment of renewables, although she is against solar farms on ""productive agricultural land"".
Her government has also said it would launch new licences for North Sea oil and gas and has lifted a moratorium on fracking.
Ms Truss has insisted that fracking would only go ahead with ""local consent"", and ministers are considering proposals from fracking firms to offer more money to communities to persuade them to give permission."	/news/business-63191791
health	Social-care insurance scheme needed, David Cameron says	"ry governments have failed to cut the ""catastrophic costs"" of social care and should now look at an ""insurance intervention"", David Cameron has said. 
former prime minister told BBC News his government ""looked at, but couldn't crack"" the issue of people having to sell their homes in old age. 
A cap on the amount people in England pay for their social care was due to be introduced in October 2023. 
But this was postponed for two years in the chancellor's autumn statement. 
Jeremy Hunt blamed concerns over staffing and financial pressures on health and social-care services.
uded a more generous means test and a lifetime cap on personal care costs of £86,000.
was first proposed by economist Sir Andrew Dilnot in 2011.  
Mr Cameron, president of Alzheimer's Research UK, told the BBC's Newscast podcast: ""The problem governments keep coming across is that while the Dilnot cap...  is a very good idea, it does tend to benefit relatively better-off households.
""If I had any advice for my successors now - and I try to keep my interventions to a minimum because their jobs are hard enough without ex-prime ministers giving a running commentary - I think looking again, if there isn't some sort of insurance intervention where we can help people protect against the catastrophic costs of selling their home to pay for care, I think that might be a good place to look.""
Delaying the introduction of the cap means some people will continue to pay more than £86,000 for their lifetime care needs.
government said an extra £2.8bn would be available for adult social care next year and £4.7bn the following year.
Health Secretary Stephen Barclay said 200,000 more care packages would be delivered. 
Councils had warned adult care services could deteriorate unless the rollout was postponed. 
But Sir Andrew said the delay was ""extraordinarily disappointing"", accusing Mr Hunt of breaking the Conservatives' 2019 manifesto commitment to fix social care.
Mr Cameron spoke to Newscast on the day health experts and charities welcomed a new drug treatment for Alzheimer's as a ground-breaking moment in the fight against the disease. 
Lecanemab is the first drug to slow the brain's destruction - after decades of failed trials.
Mr Cameron said: ""I've been president of Alzheimer's Research UK for five years now and this, I think, is the happiest day that we've had. 
""One can't overdo the enthusiasm but it feels like a breakthrough and it's very good news. 
""It will also just push forward a lot more research and a lot more enthusiasm.
""This will really generate some enthusiasm from pharmaceutical companies, from scientists, from all those that we need to work so hard.""
Mr Cameron, whose mother, Mary, has Alzheimer's, said: ""It's a very tough thing for families. You see someone with their memory just slowly being eaten away at by one of these diseases of the brain.
""We're a country of 60 million people. Soon, we're going to have a million people with dementia. It's going to be the most costly health condition. 
""It's going to be the biggest cause of of death. But far from the statistics, it's just going to be a tragedy for so many families. And I've seen that with my own family.""

technology	Competition regulator needs teeth to curb big tech, MPs say	"Big tech firms should face tougher penalties for abusing their market power, a committee of MPs has said.
Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee has urged the government to publish legislation that could allow firms to be fined up to 10% of global annual income for abuses.
MPs say the draft Digital Markets Bill, announced in the Queen's Speech in May, should be published ""without delay"".
Until this legislation is passed, consumers are at risk, they say.
mmittee argues that existing fines have been viewed as just ""a small business cost"" by the big technology businesses.
government has previously said that existing tools to regulate competition are not suitable to deal with the ""entrenched market power held by a small number of digital firms"".
It proposed the creation of a digital markets unit (DMU) within the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).
w bill would give that unit powers to tackle anti-competitive behaviour by tech giants and protect consumer rights.
CMA welcomed the report and told the BBC it would ""carefully consider and respond to the committee's recommendations in due course"".
uthority recently required Facebook owner Meta to sell animated-image platform Giphy, shortly after it acquired it. 
ruling was the first time the UK regulator had blocked an acquisition by a tech giant, and was seen as signalling a new determination to scrutinise big digital deals.
Darren Jones, who chairs the BEIS committee, said ""The Competition, Consumer and Digital Markets Bill has wide support and should be prioritised, especially given the difficulty the government currently has at passing other laws which are more controversial. 
""There are many areas in the economy where stronger competition is required in the interests of consumers, small business and economic growth, and this bill is an essential stepping stone to driving this issue forward.""
But in its evidence to the committee, the Coalition for a Digital Economy (Coadec) - which aims to provide a voice for tech startups - told MPs the proposed new regime could threaten the UK's status as the tech capital of Europe.  
MPs it focused too much on taking action against the biggest firms and not enough on encouraging start-ups to challenge them.
But the government told the BBC that it recognised the importance of the reforms to address competition issues in digital markets. 
""That is why we committed to publishing draft legislation in the Queen's Speech and will be taking forward legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows,"" it said."	/news/technology-63375260
business	California's cannabis-growing nuns pray for profits	"Merced County sits in the middle of California's Central Valley.
For as far as the eye can see, there are identical rows of crops, with the occasional farmhouse or family home. 
One of these homes looks unassuming from the outside.
re's nothing unusual about the building or the land around it, except that there's a small group of women, wearing pristine white habits, burning incense, and singing hymns as they walk in step blessing their cannabis plants.
women are the ""Sisters of the Valley,"" better known as the Weed Nuns. 
Lead by Sister Kate, the women are members of a self-proclaimed enclave of nuns who identify as healers and feminists, but more importantly, business people. They do not represent an official religion.
""I chose an industry that is messed up,"" Sister Kate says. ""It's going to probably be messed up and I'm probably going to have to do a lot of dancing and sidestepping.""
She's referring to all the confusing technicalities in the laws surrounding California's cannabis industry. 
California is home to the so-called ""green rush"" of cannabis production. It was the first state to legalise medical marijuana in 1996, and recreational use has been legal since 2016. 
's law, however, is full of regulatory loopholes, which means the legality of marijuana cultivation varies from county to county and city to city.   
So while it's legal to use cannabis in the state, nearly two-thirds of California cities have banned marijuana businesses, with others making it extremely difficult to obtain permits. 
means that for the Sisters of the Valley, growing their 60 plants outside, here in Merced County, does not fall within the law.
""The sheriffs know that, they just let me do this,"" admits Sister Kate. ""But there's really no reason for them to let me.
""They could have shut me down by now just because it's illegal to grow hemp [cannabis] in this county.
""But I think that they know we will just challenge the law and get it changed then in the county… And I think they know it would be a fight they don't want to undertake.""
re's a second home on the property which the sisters call ""the abbey""- it's where all the medicine-making takes place. 
Sister Camilla carefully pours super-strength CBD oil into tincture bottles.
roduce and sell all their own hemp-based medicines and salves, a business that before the pandemic was grossing $1.2m a year (£1m).
Despite praying for, and blessing every batch, they're now making half that.
Selling through dispensaries might help them rebuild, but that would mean even more regulations, and higher taxes.
wenty miles down the road, in downtown Merced, Joel Rodriguez, who runs the local cannabis shop, is operating legally. 
However, California has put so many taxes in place on the cannabis supply chain, Mr Rodrigez says it is putting people out of business, or pushing people to operate outside the legal regulations.
He is one of many cannabis businesses in California that complain of stifling taxes and high operating costs.
""Dealing with the tax rates as well as having the overheads that black-market dealers don't have to deal with - rent insurance payroll, just basic stuff like internet - those kinds of things we have to deal with everyday, we can't write that off, and that all goes into the end cost for the customer.""
fee for a retail license in California is $1,000.
After that there are annual state administrative and regulatory fees that can add up to tens of thousands of dollars a year for small businesses, and close to $100,000 for larger operations.
Operating legally is much more expensive than operating illegally, acting as an incentive to dealers.
gal trade in marijuana is estimated to be worth around $8bn, roughly twice as big as the legal trade in California in 2021. 
One underground dealer, who did not want to be identified by name, says he can offer a better product and make more profit by working outside legal parameters.
""Just trying to get that license is going to cost you about a million dollars,"" he says. ""And in the industry that we're in, you can accumulate a million dollars just off of doing what you're doing by making it available to everyone who doesn't have a card or doesn't have a car to get to a club.""
roughout California, those who once arrested people for cannabis offences now embrace legal businesses.
""We need to make it a little bit easier for those folks that are doing it lawfully,"" says Chief Ruben Chavez of the Gustine Police Department in the Central Valley. ""Make it easier for them to be able to produce the product and not have to go through so many hoops.""
So far this year, California has received nearly $580m dollars in tax revenue and Chief Ruben believes easing regulations would lead to more revenue for his city and help his department's efforts to eradicate the illegal trade.
""Our resources are dwindling,"" he says. ""But if we can get some revenue, some assistance, not only from the state, maybe from the Feds to go after those folks that are doing it illegally… If you stop the illegal growers, the illegal operations a little more, I think the lawful, business community will pick up more [revenue].""
roach would benefit growers like the Weed Nuns, Sister Kate says. 
""The truth is, I'd love for them to permit us, because that would be a win. And because we believe in paying taxes."""	/news/business-63393214

politics	New UK prime minister: What comes next for Rishi Sunak?	"Rishi Sunak will establish a series of firsts when he becomes prime minister - including becoming the first British Asian person to hold the office, and being the first prime minister appointed by King Charles III. But much of the process of the next few days will follow choreography set by decades of tradition.
So what happens now and what can he expect when he does formally become prime minister? 
Liz Truss will hold her final Cabinet meeting at 09:00 BST on Tuesday. As Rishi Sunak is not currently in the Cabinet, he will not be present.
Like many a departing prime minister, she will then deliver a final speech outside 10 Downing Street at about 10:15. 
Ms Truss will then be driven to Buckingham Palace to offer her resignation to the King.
means Ms Truss will miss out on her chance of a goodbye in the House of Commons, as she announced her departure after last week's Prime Minister's Questions, but is being replaced before this week's takes place at noon on Wednesday.
In the past that has provided an opportunity for a standing ovation or a tearful farewell from supporters. Last month it gave Boris Johnson the chance to tell the Commons ""Hasta la vista, baby"". 
Once Ms Truss has departed the scene - and the UK is temporarily without a prime minister - Mr Sunak, as leader of the largest party in the Commons, will be invited to Buckingham Palace by the King. 
King will ask Mr Sunak if he believes he can form a new government, before the politician is  appointed through a tradition called ""kissing hands"". 
In his autobiography, Tony Blair - who was operating on only one hour's sleep following his election victory - admitted to being a bit confused when a royal official told him: ""You don't actually kiss the Queen's hands in the ceremony of kissing hands. You brush them gently with your lips.""
Having been formally appointed as prime minister, the new leader will head to 10 Downing Street - his new workplace and (usually) his new home - although in the past, Tony Blair swapped with the living quarters above No 11 to accommodate his family more comfortably.
Here, at about 11:35, Mr Sunak will make his first prime ministerial speech with the aim of explaining what he wants to do in government.
Margaret Thatcher promised to bring ""harmony... where there is discord"", Gordon Brown vowed to ""try his utmost"", Theresa May spoke of tackling ""burning injustices"" in society, while Boris Johnson warned that ""the doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters"" would ""lose their shirts"".
re for the speech to be outside No 10 - but becoming prime minister in October means there is a persistent risk of rain, so Mr Sunak's team might be anxiously checking the weather.
w prime minister will then enter through the famous black door to be greeted by Downing Street staff, who traditionally line up to applaud their new boss. Usually it is all smiles, but not always.
When he arrived, Mr Blair noticed one of the secretaries was in tears. Lord Robin Butler - the most senior civil servant at the time - recalls that Mr Blair asked if she was OK. ""Well, Mr Blair, you are welcome,"" she replied ""but I did so like that nice Mr Major [Mr Blair's predecessor].""
re is not much time for anxious introspection as a prime minister must immediately begin appointing senior ministers, some of whom can prove to be surprisingly elusive, just at the moment the party leader wants to sound them out about accepting a promotion.
Dealing with angry or even eager colleagues is to be expected for a prime minister on their first day. Mr Sunak has yet to set out how he plans to bring together a party riven into factions that have driven out two prime ministers in three months. 
Civil servants -  government workers who are not politically appointed so do not change with a new prime minister - will have been monitoring the candidates' various policy pronouncements throughout the leadership campaign and preparing advice.
Mr Sunak has not publicly updated his policy platform since the summer, when he last ran for leader. Since then the economic picture has changed. 
Government borrowing costs have increased following weeks of market turmoil set off by Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget. 
On his first day in the job, Mr Sunak will be presented with briefs from civil servants setting out how his policy plans can be put into action. 
""It is a very big pile of paper,"" says Lord Robin Butler, who led the civil service under Ms Thatcher, John Major and Mr Blair.
""You want them [the new prime minister] to feel that everything has been thought of.""
At some point during his first few days, the prime minister will have to do something that will put everything else into perspective.
He will sit down and write letters to the four commanders of the UK Trident submarines with instructions about whether he should retaliate in the event the UK suffers a nuclear attack. The letters are stored in a safe on board the submarines, and only opened if contact with the UK is lost. 
James Callaghan - prime minister from 1976-1979 - is the only former leader to reveal what he would have done in the event of a nuclear attack.
""If we had got to that point where it was, I felt, necessary to do it - then I would have done it,"" he told a BBC documentary in 1988. ""I've had terrible doubts of course about this. And I say to you that if I had lived after having pressed that button, I would never, never have forgiven myself.""
In 2013, political historian Lord Peter Hennessy told BBC Radio Four: ""This is the moment they know what being prime minister is all about - no other job can prepare you for this."" 
first days of the prime minister's term are normally filled with phone calls from foreign dignitaries.
President Biden is looking forward to speaking with Mr Sunak in the coming days, the White House Press Secretary said. But they added that it was ""protocol for the president to wait until after an incoming British prime minister has met with the monarch and been invited to form a new government to offer his congratulations"".
gratulations have already started rolling in, though. 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted ""Special Diwali wishes"" to Mr Sunak and ""the 'living bridge' of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership""."	/news/uk-politics-62596329
health	Derby puppy that survived parvovirus home for Christmas	"A puppy that nearly died after contracting a virus will be spending his first Christmas with his family at home.
Ralph the cavapoo was just over eight weeks old when he was taken to Scarsdale Vets in Derby with diarrhoea and unusual behaviour.
He was quickly diagnosed with having parvovirus and was ""very touch and go"".
His owner Rebecca Dean said having their ""little fighter"" home would make it a good Christmas.
Mrs Dean, 29, said they had only had Ralph - a cavalier King Charles spaniel/poodle cross - for 24 hours before taking him to the vets on 25 September. 
She said: ""We noticed that he had constant diarrhoea and sickness, not eating and just not being a puppy.
""He started collapsing next to his water bowl.""
Seamus O'Cathail was one of the vets that treated Ralph.
He said: ""It was very quickly identified that he was infected with parvovirus.
""Parvovirus is an intestinal virus - it attacks the small intestines of a dog. Typically it affects young dogs, puppies would be most at risk.
""They can die very quickly from an infection if they're not properly treated.""
Ralph spent about 10 days in intensive care and was very close to developing sepsis.
Mr O'Cathail added: ""For a lot of that time he was very touch and go.""
Mrs Dean said it was ""quite scary"" for her family and she had to explain to her children that Ralph might not be coming home.
However, after a long stay at the vets, Ralph did get better.
Mrs Dean said having him at home this Christmas would be special.
""He's our little fighter. He's got plenty of Christmas presents - he is a very spoilt little doggie.

sports	LIV Golf: 2023 series recruits to be finalised 'by new year', says president Atul Khosla	"LIV Golf is targeting up to four players from the world's top 15 as it looks to complete its line-up for the lucrative Saudi Arabian-funded tour's second season in 2023.
rcuit already boasts reigning Open champion Cameron Smith along with fellow major winners Phil Mickelson, Brooks Koepka and Dustin Johnson.
LIV president Atul Khosla expects to announce new players ""by the new year"".
""We are in the middle of discussions right now,""  he added.
A source told BBC Sport: ""Future recruits look very exciting, I've heard there could be two to four players from the world's top 15 will come over.""
48-player line-up for the 2023 LIV season, with 12 additional reserves, will compete over 14 tournaments starting next February.
""We are going to get it [player recruitment] done this year. We want the teams locked in by the new year. It will play itself out over the next couple of months,"" Khosla, who works alongside commissioner Greg Norman, said at the Team Championship here in Miami.
uggests a new year shift in golf's bitter narrative after 2022 was dominated by speculation, rancour and defections by some of the game's biggest names. 
Like this year, in 2023 fields will be split into 12 four-man line-ups who will compete in a team league. This team element runs alongside $20m (£17.2m) individual events, and is worth an additional $5m per tournament and culminates in a $50m finale.
ms will be set in place after a transfer window, allowing trading between line-ups along with promised newcomers.  
Insiders say these entities, including The Majesticks GC, which features Ryder Cup stars Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Henrik Stenson as well as Englishman Sam Horsfield, will be heavily commercialised.
""We are already sold out of certain team merchandise,"" Khosla claimed while speaking on Saturday at Donald Trump's Doral resort. 
""That shows there is a desire to purchase team gear. We have launched team social channels. 
""I understand the concept is new to golf but the inherent human nature of wanting to be associated with a team is not.""
model appears dependent on attracting more top players, but leading PGA Tour stars such as Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm as well as Tiger Woods have pledged loyalty to the established tours.
LIV is also hampered because its events do not receive world ranking points.  
It has formed a strategic alliance with the relatively minor Middle East-based Mena Tour to bolster its bid for official recognition from the world ranking body that includes PGA and DP World Tour representation on its board.
""We believe we deserve the points,"" said Khosla. ""Clearly, including with our alliance with the Mena Tour, we absolutely deserve the points. 
""We can't control who is on the board and who is conflicted there. It is obvious at this point there are individuals on the board who are conflicted.""
LIV's arrival in men's professional golf has prompted an acrimonious battle for the future of the game. While the establishment would argue otherwise, Khosla insists they are a non-confrontational addition to men's golf.
""I can't control it,"" he said. ""I'm not the one creating that narrative. I can just focus on what we can do; fan experience and player experience.""
LIV has yet to secure a major television deal in the United States or the UK. These appear vital to the ambitions of the fledgling tour. 
""With a global league, we are looking at rights across the board,"" Khosla said.
""On the US front, we are back and forth with a few different networks. Step one was to show them the product, which they clearly understand.""
LIV tournaments are currently shown on YouTube and the tour's own website platforms. ""We are now at the point where outlets have said time could be cleared,"" Khosla added.
""I feel good about where we are but we have work to do over the next couple of months. We think we are providing an incredible commercial product. 
""These are not six-month or one-year deals, if a TV network is getting behind this it's for multiple years.""
LIV is also involved in negotiations with international broadcasters with several of its players having taken part in talks with broadcasters from their own country. There was no indication that a deal is imminent with a British network.
""We have got to start commercialising the product,"" Khosla said. ""We have got to get on TV, we have to get corporate partners. These are milestones that we need to hit.""
In the tournament, Poulter's Majesticks were knocked out in Saturday's quarter finals by Koepka's Smash GC who won all three points in their match up. 
4 Aces, captained by Dustin Johnson also progressed to Sunday's stroke play showdown along with the Australian quartet Punch GC who went through despite Smith being beaten 2&1 by Sergio Garcia. 
Louis Oosthuizen took his South African Stingers team through to the final day by beating Bryson DeChambeau after the American found water at the fifth extra hole of their contest."	/sport/golf/63441853
health	Critical incidents declared at NHS trusts	"Critical incidents have been declared at some NHS trusts.
NHS Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin called a critical incident due to extremely high demand, Shropshire Council said.
Critical operations would be prioritised with rising Covid cases and workforce sickness contributing to pressures.
Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said there had been pressure on its emergency care services.
On Tuesday, the Worcestershire trust said there had been ""several days of sustained and extreme pressure on our urgent and emergency care services"".
rganisation, which runs services at Worcestershire Royal Hospital, Alexandra Hospital in Redditch and Kidderminster hospital, asked people who need urgent medical care, but was not an emergency, to use NHS 111 or a minor injury unit.
In Shropshire, patients with the highest level of need would be prioritised, the council said. This could mean non-urgent services being postponed and routine operations rescheduled. 
Cancer and other critical operations would continue to be prioritised.
Chief Nursing Officer for NHS Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin Alison Bussey asked people to only come to A&E for life-threatening conditions and injuries. 
""We regret that it has been necessary to take this step, but it is important that we focus on patients needing urgent and emergency care as a priority,"" she said.
Sandwell and West Birmingham NHS Trust said it declared a critical incident ""due to a sustained spike in the numbers of patients coming to A&E for medical help, combined with higher staff absences due to short term seasonal sickness"".  
Chief executive Richard Beeken said it was ""an extraordinary situation that has required an extraordinary response"" and staff were working ""tirelessly"", but it was ""stretched to capacity"".
He stated simple things to do were getting vaccinations that were offered, not delaying seeking medical help - NHS111 online could advise - and ensuring being stocked up on repeat prescriptions.
Later, the chief executive said on Wednesday night it was able to stand down its critical incident status.

business	Liz Truss versus The Markets	"What drives ""The Markets"" to act as they do, and to blow governments off course? Do investors want political power, to undercut public spending, or merely a reliable return for their money?
Can a democracy be undermined by ""The Markets""? The left has long thought so. The experience of Greece, during the Eurozone crisis, showed how it can happen - a democratic mandate blown off course because the markets don't think the government can sustain its borrowing.
's not what was expected of a Conservative government in one of the world's largest economies with its own currency.
It may seem stranger still when that government sets out to cut top rate tax and let companies keep more of their profits, while removing restrictions on financiers' bonuses. How could ""The Markets"" wish to undermine that?
But that's what we've seen. From the left comes one observation that governments should protect us from markets, but with the humiliating dismantling of Liz Truss's experiment in unfunded tax-cutting, it has been markets that have protected us from the government.
So how can an entity which is impossible to locate, with no central neural function, and with a reputation for being skittish, herd-like, irrational and ethically challenged, force Downing Street to abandon its plans?
It has to do with risk and trust. Like an old-fashioned bank manager assessing you for a loan, those who take the individual decisions to buy a UK government bond have to make a judgement on whether the government that issued it is able to pay out interest each year and to repay the face value at the end of its term? 
And by that time, might there be so many other bonds issued that it's significantly less likely that it can do so?
It is not just a question of whether Britain would default, which it has never done before. It is an investor's judgement of whether that bond will hold its value as debt grows.
So what are these investors looking for? A serious, stable government that knows what it's doing, that sets rules for controlling its annual deficits and debt, with a reasonable expectation that it has the discipline to stick to the plan. The mini-budget on 23 September offered none of that.
Investors can see that governments change course and break rules as they're buffeted by events. They'll often forgive that. They know other parties will win power and bring other priorities. Investors are not anti-democratic. 
But their job is to safeguard money and earn from it, so they also make a judgement about how much that borrowing profile is likely to change with a new government. If one is turfed out by the voters, will the next one act responsibly?
's why ""The Market"" is not just about numbers. The people in it are constantly making judgements about politics and about the people at the top of politics: about stability, reliability and competence, none of which can easily be measured or subjected to the mathematicians whom investment houses hire.
r judgement of character can be as flawed as they are by any of us. But their assessment of Liz Truss and Trussonomics has been harsh.
Bond investors primary concern is with levels of borrowing, but do they care much about the balance of tax and spending? Do they, perhaps, harbour a preference for low tax with a limited state and public services?
You might well find that financiers are more likely to be both conservative about public finance and Conservative with their votes. But it's not necessarily the case that they want to see public services and the size of the state cut back.
For those who invest in company shares rather than bonds, there is a recognition that firms do well in a country with strong public services. They need the infrastructure to get their supplies in and their products to market, their data flowing rapidly and reliably, and to move their staff to and from work. 
For a company that operates in Britain and the USA, their workforce is provided with relatively efficient, tax-funded health care in one country, while the payroll cost of private insurance in the other is a huge corporate  burden. Corporate investors are attracted to countries with a strong and reasonably predictable rule of law.
want to see an economy that's geared for growth, and Liz Truss is not the only person who thinks that the UK needs to boost its growth rate. Where she differs from many others is in the belief that the starting point is lower tax. 
rs are more likely to identify low productivity as the vital and malfunctioning cog in the British economic machine. They argue that it is in adding value during an hour's or a day's honest toil that we earn greater prosperity, rather than stimulating demand and investment, while whizzing money round the economy at a faster rate.
So with a background of rising interest rates internationally, and after three weeks of political and financial turmoil buffeting the British government, what did the markets perceive as Liz Truss junked her close ally as punishment for implementing the policies that won her the Tory leadership?
Enough to give her the thumbs down. Thursday's expectations of a U-turn rallied bond prices and the pound. But these positive moves were pared back when they saw, first, the limited extent of the announcement and - perhaps more important - the limited understanding that the prime minister seems to have of her weak position as she faced the cameras on Friday afternoon.
Asked why she wasn't exiting Downing Street as she had told Kwasi Kwarteng to do, her answers sounded like her continued presence in office is necessary to provide stability.
It's unlikely Jeremy Hunt, the new chancellor, will see things that way. If his job is to reassure markets, and it is, then he can dictate terms to his neighbour in Number 10. 
In interviews on Saturday morning, he did little to support the prime minister beyond repeating her appeal for stability. At the same time, he did a lot to shred her approach to public finances. 
More taxes will have to rise, he said. Spending will be cut. Nothing is protected while he examines the books, including spending on the NHS. This was not just a U-turn on a botched mini-budget, but a re-set of Britain's public finances, with a warning that it will hurt.
Liz Truss looks like a prisoner of her new chancellor. With her authority in tatters, she is a prisoner of her cabinet, if they combine to stand up to her. She is a prisoner of her parliamentary party, in which MPs are reported to be deeply dismayed and unimpressed.
PM can continue to push the larger part of the mini-budget's Growth Plan that remains, for now, intact. 
But apart from tax, look what that involves: planning deregulation to allow housebuilding, fracking (also not in Scotland), de-regulation of worker rights and environmental protection - all of them vulnerable to backbench mutiny as well as external pushback. Does Liz Truss really have the authority to push these through against opposition?
And then there's spending. In her brief statement, she gave a few hints of where she's heading. One was: ""We will do whatever is necessary to ensure debt is falling as a share of the economy in the medium term"".
Whatever is necessary means either tax or spending or both have to fit with that borrowing constraint, and the prime minister will surely want to hang on to at least some of her tax cuts. 
Second, she talked of delivering public services more efficiently. Who could argue with that? But it's been tried by every other prime minister, and if it doesn't mean cuts, then it certainly means a squeeze, and usually an uncomfortable one for those who depend on those services as well as public sector workers. The new chancellor, from his time as health secretary, has shown he is content to court unpopularity.
""Spending will grow less rapidly than previously planned"": another hint from the prime minister of at least a squeeze, and amplified on Saturday by Jeremy Hunt.
uld come to Scots directly in welfare benefits and indirectly through the block grant to Holyrood, with limited ability for MSPs to use tax varying and welfare powers to mitigate the effects.
Scottish government and SNP MSPs may also be watching closely and learning what happens to a country that lives beyond its means in the vague hope that the bond markets will sustain an uncontrolled level of deficit and rising debt at comparable interest rates to its neighbours, and in the equally vague hope that this will achieve faster growth with which to make anything and everything possible.
It may have a sobering effect this Monday as the Scottish government publishes its economic prospectus for independence."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-63268826
business	Rail strikes and flight cancellations: Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery?	"For travellers, the past fortnight has brought a tidal wave of bad news.
Cancelled flights, proposed rail strikes and record-breaking petrol prices have thrown people's plans into disarray - and now the peak summer holiday season and the long school break are hovering on the horizon. 
After more than two years of Covid restrictions, this should be a summer of fun. 
But are we now heading into a summer of misery? 
We take a look at where things stand for planes and trains over the weeks ahead.
UK air travel industry has just faced what is arguably its biggest test since coronavirus rules were lifted and it is fair to say, it has been a bumpy ride. 
Over the Jubilee bank holiday, which coincided with many schools' half-term breaks, 750 flights out of the UK were cancelled, according to aviation data firm Cirium. Around 466 return flights were axed.
Although cancellations made up a small percentage of total flights, many passengers were only informed at short notice and faced long queues to check-in bags and get through security.  
Staff shortages from job cuts made at the height of the pandemic have been driving cancellations and delays, heightening holidaymakers' anxiety that problems will continue into the key summer season.
Add to that the threat of strike action. British Airways workers have voted in favour of supporting industrial action, in a ballot conducted by the Unite union, while Ryanair is facing walkouts by staff in parts of Europe.
Jess Baker has been put off travelling abroad this summer after a recent ""nightmare"" 18-hour journey home from Iceland. 
She, her husband Shaun and their two children had their EasyJet flight into Luton cancelled on Monday.
were given the option to travel home on Thursday but needed to get back sooner so paid £1,000 to fly into Glasgow with Icelandair. They shelled out an additional £340 to hire a car to drive down to Luton to collect their own vehicle. 
""It's been an absolute nightmare,"" says Ms Baker. ""We quickly decided that we'll go camping here instead. It's not worth the hassle all over again."" 
Others may have the same idea. Sykes Holiday Cottages says it has seen a 22% rise in bookings in the past two weeks compared to the same period last year. 
Chief executive Graham Donoghue says it is ""at least in part due to widespread reports of overseas travel disruption"".
""Travellers simply don't want to have to tackle airports and take the risk that their family holidays could be cancelled,"" he says.
Since cutting staff, airlines, airports and the companies that provide baggage handling have been recruiting but because new workers have to pass security checks, it takes time.  
Heathrow airport's boss John Holland-Kaye recently told the Financial Times it could take up to 18 months for the aviation sector to ""fully recover capacity"".
Aviation consultant Chris Tarry tells the BBC the situation should improve as more staff are security cleared, but he warns there are ""unlikely to be enough workers in certain areas given wages and working conditions"".
And airports ""only work if all of the elements are in place"", he says.
Glastonbury Festival returns this year on 22 June, but it might not be that easy to get there now rail strikes have been announced. 
More than 40,000 RMT Union members from Network Rail and 13 train operators are set to walk out after talks over pay and redundancies broke down.
rikes are due to take place on 21, 23 and 25 June but it is likely services across the whole week will be disrupted. Train drivers are also going to hold their own strikes over pay.
Passengers have been advised not to travel on trains unless necessary during the strikes.
Zahid Fayyaz, a solicitor from Brixton who is planning to travel to Glastonbury by train, is worried about the impact the potential strikes might have.
He originally had a ticket for 23 June but because of the planned strike on that day he and his two friends have bought new tickets to travel the day before. It cost them £240 and an extra day off work.
""It's going to take an extra two hours, but aside from this I'll be fine. But other people won't be able to take time off work or afford the extra money,"" the 40-year-old says.
Mr Fayyaz says he is broadly sympathetic to the rail workers striking, but believes the ""timing is wrong"".
Glastonbury Festival is one of several events impacted by potential travel disruption, along with a cricket test match between England and New Zealand in Leeds.
Some people are switching their mode of transport to buses and coaches. Chris Hardy, managing director of National Express, said the firm had seen an increase in enquiries and bookings during the days of the rail strikes.
walkout could yet be called off if all parties can reach an agreement.
's what John Kuehne, from Fort Lauderdale in Florida, is hoping for.
He's traveling to England along with many of his friends from around the world to see prog-rock legends Yes, who are performing at London's Royal Albert Hall on 21 June.
But ""everything is up in the air"" now, he says. ""Car rentals, parking, fuel, tolls, and congestion zone fees make it very expensive and inconvenient.""
Mr Kuehne also happens to be arriving in the UK just as the cost of filling an average family car hit £100 for the first time. 
He says labour disputes happen but that ""all sides need to come together quickly to find a reasonable solution"". 
""What they do in the next two weeks will affect the lives of thousands of people who just want the wonderful experience of modern British mass transit."""	/news/business-61747449

sports	Boris Becker feared attack in UK jail but learned lesson	"Less than a week after former Grand Slam tennis champion Boris Becker was freed after serving seven and a half months in a UK jail, he has spoken of his loneliness, his fears and the lessons he learned behind bars.
In a lengthy and at times emotional one-on-one German TV interview, he revealed he had learned a hard, painful and very expensive lesson and rediscovered the person he once was: ""But the whole experience also taught me something important and good. And some things happen for a good reason.""
Becker, 55, was jailed last April for two and a half years for hiding £2.5m (€2.9m; $3m) of his assets and loans to avoid paying his creditors. He was declared bankrupt in 2017 with debts of almost £50m because of an unpaid loan of more than £3m on his Spanish estate in Majorca.
Last week the former tennis champion and BBC TV commentator was deported to Germany, on a private plane paid for by a friend. His interview with TV host Steven Gätjen for German commercial broadcaster Sat 1 went out on Tuesday night.
His first weeks in detention were at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London, but most of sentence was spent at Huntercombe Prison, near Henley in Oxfordshire. As a Category C jail, it is more secure than an open prison and one of two facilities reserved for foreign nationals.
Dressed for the interview in black, Becker immediately cut a slimmer figure than when he was sent to prison in April. His hair was also visibly darker. In prison you're a nobody, you're just a number, he said. His was A2923EV.
""For the first time in my life I felt hungry - meaning I went to bed hungry,"" he remarked, pointing out he weighed 97kg on arrival in jail and lost 7kg over the next few months, although he had since put on more weight. ""Prison was good for my health. They did have alcohol but I didn't drink any.""
At Wandsworth he was given a cell to himself because of his name, he said. But when the door slammed shut for the first time it was for him the loneliest moment he had ever had. He remembered being unable to sleep because of screams from fellow inmates, who were every kind of criminal imaginable.
re was no mirror in his cell because it could be used as a weapon and he admitted to being shocked when he discovered how he had changed.
Although he was afraid of taking a shower because of attacks he had seen in films, in reality there was enough privacy so ""you don't see anyone naked"". He also spoke of one prisoner at Wandsworth who had tried to blackmail him into giving him money.
Prison life was clearly a challenge and Becker did not hold back in his description of death threats, very dirty cells and highly dangerous inmates. ""My main concern was having a double cell. Your cellmate can attack or threaten you.""
For the first three weeks he said he tried not to stick out and just wore grey. He learnt to avoid looking at other inmates and kept his eyes to the ground: ""Just don't look at another inmate the wrong way.""
""Actually I once had what they call an 'altercation' with an inmate who wanted to kill me,"" he said of an incident at Huntercombe prison in October.
""He tried to come after me, he told me all the things he'd do to me,"" said Becker. When he shouted for help it was other prisoners on the wing who had to come out to help. Prison guards tended to turn up slowly, or not at all, he said.
man had underestimated Becker's position in prison, he believed, and later asked for his forgiveness and kissed his hand.
He got to know three inmates he names as Jake, Russell and Billy who he describes as ""listeners"" and even credits them with saving his life.
After three months at Huntercombe, Becker describes being transferred to another wing where he worked as a fitness trainer and taught Maths, English and even Greek philosophy.
He was full of praise for some of his fellow inmates for their support and spoke movingly of the support he had received from two figures from the world of German sport who know the UK well.
Former Wimbledon tennis champion Michael Stich sent him a three-page letter and Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp had wanted to visit but was not allowed to, partly for his own safety but also because the prison did not want the fuss.
Becker's partner Lilian de Carvalho Monteiro visited every two weeks, and his two older sons, Noah and Elias also came, although he decided it was better for his younger two children not to come. 
While he enjoyed the two hours together, he always wanted to go home afterwards or to an Italian restaurant, but instead went back to his cell and the reality of prison life returned.
He was often emotional during the interview, which lasted more than two hours and for which he was paid a purported €500,000.
His 231 days in prison had, he said, given him time to rethink his life and to become closer to his four children and partner. His relationship with his daughter had become closer than ever, he said.
""When the cell door closes, then there is nothing left,"" he said. His task now was not to waste his second chance."	/news/world-europe-64049421
entertainment	Takeoff: Drake and Justin Bieber join fans at Atlanta service for Migos rapper	"usands of fans have paid their final respects to the Migos rapper Takeoff at a star-studded memorial service in Atlanta, Georgia.
Stars including Drake, Justin Bieber and Chloe Bailey were all reported to be in attendance at Friday's ""celebration of life"" ceremony.
28-year-old musician died in a shooting at a bowling alley in Houston, Texas earlier this month.
Police are still investigating and have made no arrests.
Fans braved the rain to attend the roughly three-hour event at the State Farm Arena, a 21,000-capacity stadium.
Relatives - including the two surviving members of Migos, his uncle Quavo and his cousin Offset - led with heartfelt tributes to the young artist.
Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens gave the late rapper, whose real name is Kirshnik Khari Ball, the city's highest honour: the Phoenix Award.

No media was allowed inside the venue, and phones and recording devices were also banned.
But in images and videos leaked on social media, Drake and others were shown making heartfelt speeches.
Following the event, a motorcade was seen carrying Takeoff's body to its final resting place.

health	Lioness Demi Stokes opens up about her crazy entrance into the world	"Lioness Demi Stokes who was born 10 weeks early weighing 3lb (1.3kg) has shared her birth story to show premature babies are strong.
Manchester City and England star said she had a ""crazy entrance into the world"" after being born in a toilet.
30-year-old footballer has opened up to mark World Prematurity Day.
""I probably was quite small when I started playing football, but it just meant I had to work a little bit harder,"" she said.
""And actually, once I did fill out, I probably overtook the bigger guys,"" said Stokes, who joined Sunderland's youth academy aged eight and by 16 was playing in the first team.
""I think that's what I'd say to other parents now - don't worry if they're small and if they might be a bit late to develop, because we catch up. 
""We need to let little premmie babies know they are strong and... very robust.""
Stokes and her partner Katie Harrington have a six-month-old son, Harlen, who was born six weeks early weighing 5lbs (2.3kg).
He needed to spend a week in hospital after being born via emergency Caesarean.
She said it was only since becoming a parent it had sunk in what an anxious time it must have been for her own mum.
""But it's interesting because when I do speak to my mum about it, she doesn't ever say, 'Oh, it was horrendous'... I feel like she must have blocked it out.""
She said she had two other siblings who were also premature and while they were healthy, ""everyone's experience isn't the same"".
Stokes said she had shared her story to help start conversations around what experiencing a premature or difficult birth could be like for those going through it.
""It's important we talk about it,"" she said. 
Her partner also had pre-eclampsia, which she became seriously unwell with.
""It was really scary... I remember thinking, 'Demi, just have a poker face' - because if I crumble, I'm not going to help Katie,"" she said. 
She believed the skills she learned as a footballer, in terms of mental focus and staying calm under pressure, helped in the moment. 
""But inside, I was panicking and I was worried, definitely,"" she shared. ""I think not until after, when she came home, then I was like, 'You were really poorly, you were really unwell'.""
Stokes added that both were doing well now - and despite being ""a little early"", Harlen's ""really filled out and thriving"".

business	The workers getting 100% pay for 80% of the hours	"usands of UK workers are starting a four-day week trial from Monday. 
About 70 companies are taking part in what is thought to be the world's biggest pilot scheme into the working pattern over the next six months.
xperiment has been organised by a group campaigning for a shorter working week, but for no loss in wages. 
During the trial, employees will get 100% pay for 80% of the hours they would usually work, with the aim of being more productive. 
Academics from Oxford and Cambridge universities, as well experts at Boston College in the US, will manage the experiment in partnership with the think tank Autonomy.
Companies ranging from office-based software developers and recruitment firms to charities and a local fish and chip shop are taking part.
Sam Smith, co-founder of Pressure Drop Brewery in Tottenham, north London, said it felt ""like a good time"" for the firm to be trying different working practices.
""The pandemic's made us think a great deal about work and how people organise their lives,"" he added. ""We're doing this to improve the lives of our staff and be part of a progressive change in the world that will improve people's mental health and wellbeing.""
Mr Smith's challenge during the pilot scheme is pretty simple. His nine-strong team have to produce and package the same amount of beer as they do now, but in four days instead of five.  
""I think it's about how you use your time,"" said Mr Smith. ""So when I talk about being productive I don't mean being faster at the task you're doing right now, it might be making use of the natural downtimes you have to prepare better for the following day.""
Clare Doherty, who helps run the office for the firm, said the trial is ""fantastic"" and part of a ""natural progression of how we work"".
She explained that having worked with the business for more than four years and knowing she can do her job has led her to feeling confident she can get her work done efficiently with one day less. 
""It'll take those extra few minutes of scrolling through the internet out of your day because you have to be just that bit more focused to get what you need done in the time you have,"" she said. 
Meanwhile, Craig Carmichael, who works on the shop floor, thinks an extra rest day will motivate him to work harder. 
""If I know I have to get stuff done in four days' time to enjoy that extra day, I think that will be a good incentive,"" he told the BBC. 
xperiment, involving some 3000 UK workers, is part of worldwide initiative and is running alongside similar, smaller trials in Ireland, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. 
""The UK trial is historic"", said Juliet Schor, the lead researcher on the Global 4-day week project, and an economist and sociologist at Boston College.
""The basis of this movement is that there's activity going on in many workplaces, particularly white collar workplaces, that's low-productivity and that you can cut without harming the business."" 
She said the trouble with the five-day week is that work can simply expand to fit the time available. 
""Sticking to a rigid, centuries-old, time-based system doesn't make sense,"" Ms Schor added.
""You can be 100% productive in 80% of the time in many workplaces, and companies adopting this around the world have shown that."" 
researcher admitted the idea might not suit everyone and every profession, such as health care and teaching, where staff could already be over worked and stressed out. 
But even if workers are just 10% more productive the economics can still stack up, she argued, if it leads to lower sickness rates, fewer staff leaving and making it easier to attract new recruits. 
However, Julian Jessop, an independent economist and fellow at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said while he was in favour of the trial he was ""sceptical"" it would show good results across the entire economy. ""You'd have to become 25% more productive per day,"" he said.
""There are some services where a four-day working week is not a realistic option. Doctors are already struggling to provide enough GP appointments - how can they see 25% more patients in a day? And it's difficult to see how a bar person can pull 25% more pints in a day too.""
Girling Jones, a small construction recruitment firm in Exeter switched to a four-day week in January, but has also signed up to the trial 
Productivity is up and so are profits, the boss and company founder Simon Girling said.
""All our inputs - calls, meetings, interviews, are up... quite simply everyone is doing more in less time,"" he added. 
Staff are happier too - Ellen Andreassen said she uses her day off to relax. 
""I'm definitely more motivated. One thing I've noticed is sleep. I'm sleeping a lot better and getting up is a lot easier.""
Her colleague Josh Cockerill said spending more time with his daughter was helping him save money on nursery fees. 
""You know the fact that you've got a day off in the middle of the week, it gives you more incentive to work harder towards that day off,"" he said. 
After upending daily routines through the Covid pandemic, the business was ready to try new working patterns. 
""About three years ago I was lucky enough to start a four-day week and it was life changing,"" said Mr Girling.
""When we came back from the pandemic, we did a lot of research into it and I couldn't see any downside.
""I think being part of this four-day week pilot, there's going to be some really detailed stats on this. I'm not sure it would work across all industries or businesses but it's a really good opportunity for a lot of firms to change how they work and maybe improve."" "	/news/business-61570021
business	Cancelled flights: Travel firms have oversold flights and holidays - Shapps	"Airlines and operators have ""seriously oversold flights and holidays"" relative to their capacity to deliver, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said.
Mr Shapps said it had been ""very distressing"" to see people facing more disruption at airports with ""holidays cancelled and plans left in disarray"".
Passengers are facing travel problems ahead of the Jubilee weekend, with several airlines cancelling flights.
Up to two million people are preparing to fly over the next few days.
majority of flights will be operating as scheduled, said Airlines UK which represents Tui, EasyJet and British Airways.
Mr Shapps said the government had been clear that it was up to industry leaders to tackle travel disruption, which was also seen at Easter.
ransport secretary said he would meet with airports, airlines and ground handlers to ""find out what's gone wrong and how they are planning to end the current run of cancellations and delays"".
""Despite government warnings, operators seriously oversold flights and holidays relative to their capacity to deliver. This must not happen again and all efforts should be directed at there being no repeat of this over the summer - the first post-Covid summer season,"" he added. 
Passengers are facing ongoing disruption ahead of the bank holiday weekend, with holiday giant Tui announcing it will cancel six flights a day until the end of June, affecting around 34,000 travellers in all.
Around 10,000 flights are set to leave the UK between Thursday and Sunday, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium.
Other airlines, including EasyJet, have also cancelled flights, with the aviation industry suffering from staff shortages as it struggles to recruit replacements for the thousands of workers it laid off during the coronavirus pandemic when international travel halted.
Before Covid, airports and airlines across Britain employed around 140,000 people, but since then thousands of jobs have been cut, including around 30,000 for UK airlines alone.
Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency and a former Virgin Atlantic director, said the industry had been ""overwhelmed"" since demand for flights returned after the pandemic but argued the government itself was ""responsible for this chaos"".
""[The transport secretary] has got a bit of a nerve I'm afraid,"" he told the BBC. ""It's because of government restrictions that changed so much during the pandemic, and then the shutdown of the industry with the Omicron variant last December, that has created this problem.""
He added that without certainty over when travel restrictions would be eased, the industry was not able to recruit more staff.
Kelly Sandhu, from the Aviation Recruitment Network, said the process of hiring new workers took a long time so there was ""not a quick fix"" .
Airlines UK said the sector had ""only a matter of weeks to recover and prepare for one of the busiest summers we've seen in many years"" but, despite this, ""the vast majority"" of flights this week would be operating as scheduled.
Michael Turner, a nurse from Shoreham, has abandoned his family holiday to Tenerife after their flights were cancelled three times.
Due to fly from Gatwick last Thursday, Mr Turner was told his EasyJet flight had been cancelled 20 minutes before departure. 
He rebooked a Tui flight which was all that was available and said he experienced ""absolute chaos"" in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport.  
After boarding the plane, Mr Turner said they spent three hours waiting only to be then escorted off to collect their baggage.
were put on a coach without being told where they were going and then waited to be taken back to the airport for a flight on Tuesday evening.
But the family's flight was cancelled again and they have declined a fourth rescheduled flight offer for Wednesday instead opting to go home.
Manchester Airport said Tui and Swissport, which provides ground services such as baggage handling, were ""experiencing temporary staff shortages, in common with other aviation and travel companies"".
A spokesperson for Swissport apologised for its part in any disruption, adding that the return of demand for flights was ""exacerbating resource challenges across the aviation industry"". 
Elsewhere, Glasgow Airport said the airport had been ""busier than it has been for more than two years"", while at Edinburgh Airport some passengers had to queue outside the terminal building to check in luggage. 
Prospect, the union which represents staff across air traffic control and in aviation engineering, warned that things could ""get worse before they get better"". 
Garry Graham, its deputy general secretary, said that while the furlough scheme had helped people, the government had ignored that it ""ended well before the majority of international restrictions on travel came to an end"".
But Mr Shapps said the government had helped the industry through ""changing the law to speed up bringing in newly recruited staff"" as well as providing £8bn of support during the pandemic.
Airport Operators Association, which represents the industry, said big recruitment campaigns had been under way since before the start of this year and additional staff were now being deployed.

sports	Bristol Pitbulls: Team starting to turn corner after three consecutive wins	"Bristol Pitbulls head coach Jamie Elson said ""things are starting to click"" for the team after three consecutive wins.
Pitbulls moved up to the National Ice Hockey League (NIHL) National Division this season, the second tier of elite ice hockey in the UK.
m lost 17 of their first 25 fixtures but have won their last three matches.
""It's been a long time coming,"" Elson told BBC Radio Bristol. 
""Things are starting to click a little bit, we're turning a bit of a corner. We've gone up a division to the highest division here, that's a jump from last year where we were. 
""We brought a big chuck of those guys that were on last year's team that had a big year with us. It's just taken some guys some time to customise themselves and get them up to that new level of play, it's obviously at a higher level. 
""We've got a number of new guys in the group. We had to recruit more guys than any team in this league this summer. It's been a bedding in period but we feel like we're getting there."" 
For a long time the Pitbulls were based in Oxford after the closure of Bristol's ice rink in 2012. They now play at a new venue in Cribbs Causeway in their home city where they relocated last year.
m captain, Canadian Owen Sobchak, who transferred to the club this season, said he hoped the recent run of results mean the club can progress up the table as the campaign continues. 
""When we've played the top teams in the table right now we've put a good competition against them. We're just a few bounces, a few opportunities from winning those games,"" said Sobchak. 
""I think as the year goes on and we capitalise on those opportunities teams are going to underestimate us and we're going to take advantage of that and go on a little run here."""	/sport/ice-hockey/63988083
