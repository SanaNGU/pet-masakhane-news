entertainment	Harry and Meghan: Does Netflix's documentary live up to the hype?	"Heavily trailed, hugely anticipated - but did Harry & Meghan make good TV? 
Plot spoiler alert. 
If you watched the trailers and thought Harry & Meghan, Netflix's heavily-promoted new series, was going to be explosive, prepare to be disappointed. 
Unless you are an individual member of the Royal Family, in which case, you might be opening the champagne - a drink, we learnt from this new show, that Harry doesn't usually enjoy. 
ut it kindly, this is slow-burn television.  
Volume One, as it was rather grandiosely titled, came out in three episodes on Thursday.  
Perhaps Volume Two, for which we must wait another week, will get to the details so tantalisingly alluded to in those trailers: who leaked and planted stories about the couple? Who was fighting a ""war against Meghan to suit other people's agendas""? Who was playing a ""dirty game""?
What we got - over almost three hours - were new, private details of their ""great love story"", as Harry put it. Think soft focus lenses, Nina Simone playing in the background, lots of private photographs, videos and even, apparently, a call between Meghan and a friend as she was getting engaged (""OMG it's happening"" she says).
Harry and Meghan's unseen video moments - the BBC's Jonny Dymond takes a look.
Also discussed at length through the first volume is harassment by the media. Harry calls it his duty to ""uncover this exploitation and bribery"".
More damagingly, the programmes build up a sense that Britain has an endemic problem with structural racism, particularly in relation to the Royal Family and the media.  
Historian and TV presenter David Olusoga describes the optimism many Britons of colour (and others) felt about Meghan's arrival into the heart of the Royal Family. ""There was a hope maybe of having difficult conversations that have been pushed away so many times"".  Subtext, addressed later - it wasn't to be.
But these three episodes were broadbrush, rather than aimed at specific individuals.  
Netflix has billed Harry & Meghan as an ""unprecedented and in-depth documentary series"".  
But the programme, unsurprisingly, was heavily one-sided and selective.  
At one point, Meghan describes the media interview and photocall the couple gave when they got engaged as an ""orchestrated reality show"".  
Is that what Netflix's Harry & Meghan, produced in association with the couple's company, is?
Interestingly, they began recording video diaries in March 2020, as they stepped away from royal duties. That was many months before their Netflix deal was announced.
r truth in the hands of the Netflix professionals, a slickly produced narrative about a couple who fell in love and had to sacrifice everything as they butted up against systems, protocols and racism.
Royal Family - we are told at the start - didn't choose to make any comment for the programme makers. Both Kensington Palace and Buckingham Palace confirmed they received an email purporting to be from a production company from an unknown organisation's address and attempted to verify its authenticity with Archewell Productions and Netflix, but did not receive a response, PA reported.
A source told PA the substance of the email did not address the entire series.
So what we have is carefully curated to back up the couple.
Netflix is adept at the modern language of television which steers us through the story.  The couple met on social media - perhaps the first royals to do so and certainly a great advert for Instagram.  Their early messages are shared with us, popping up on screen in a device so often used by TV in our tech age.
rviews with Harry set up his wife as the true heir to his mother, Princess Diana.  He says Meghan has the ""same empathy, the same warmth"".  The show regularly cuts to archive footage of Diana, as Harry discusses his fears that history could repeat itself.
re are also narrative cliffhangers to keep us watching.  
Harry describes trying to deal with the loss of his mother ""without much support or help or guidance"", and describes his ""second family"" in Africa, a group of friends ""that literally brought me up"".  
Where was his father? We can't help asking.  
Will we find out more?
He talks about how male royals tend to marry women ""who fit in the mould"" instead of for love.  Is he inferring that's what his brother did?  Does Volume Two answer that question?
Meghan mentions her first meeting with Kate and William, when as ""a hugger"" she was informal and tactile.  She says that is ""jarring for some Brits"".  Are we supposed to read more into that, after all the stories about the breakdown of relations between the couples? 
rs frankly help along a narrative that gets a little repetitive at times. 
rogramme seems made primarily for an American audience. And Harry has embraced the language of the US West Coast.  He talks about how, just before news of their relationship broke, they went out for one last secret night and managed to ""pull the pin on the fun grenade"".  
We hear about ""lived experience"" and ""cause-driven work"".
But if you were tuning in for jaw-dropping revelations, Prince Charles on Dimbleby, Prince Andrew on Newsnight, Princess Diana on Panorama this was not.
w Netflix show wasn't even Meghan and Harry on Oprah.
was the last time the couple endeavoured to tell their truth.
In that bombshell interview, they told Oprah about overt racism by a member of the Royal Family about what colour their future son's skin might be.  We don't hear anything about that over the three episodes.  Who said it still remains a mystery.
But Harry does talk about his own journey to understand ""unconscious bias"".  He also addresses some of the racism of which he has been accused in the past, describing how ""ashamed"" he felt after he wore a Nazi uniform costume to a party in 2005.
rogramme shows him on a journey of constant discovery and self analysis about racism. 
It's left to other contributors to raise Britain's history around the slave trade, as well as the ""skeletons in the closet"" in the Royal Family.  
But in the end, will this programme persuade anyone to change their opinions?  
After the show and then Harry's book, Spare, is published in January, the couple's ""truth"" will be fully out there.  Will that be enough for them?  
r currency might begin to wane as they struggle with the law of diminishing returns.  They may still want to battle royal institutions and the media, but it may turn out that their real battle will be with ongoing relevancy."	/news/entertainment-arts-63890246
health	Have I dodged Covid and what does it mean?	"I hope this vial of blood contains answers because I have a nagging question - have I managed to dodge Covid?
It seems remarkable that anyone could. The virus has swept the world since it emerged in China nearly three years ago. Fresh variants have become better and better at infecting us. Even vaccines make Covid milder rather than being an impenetrable shield. 
Yet I worked in the office throughout, even in lockdowns, and the virus ripped through the rest of my family and I didn't get sick. And I'm far from the only person to have gone through the pandemic without getting the walloping symptoms of Covid or to have never tested positive. One estimate in the summer suggested around one-in-10 people in the UK still hadn't been infected. 
So what's going on? And does my body - and those of other ""never-Coviders"" - contain some secret to tackling the disease? 
re are three broad possibilities if you think you've dodged the virus:  
""There are a lot of people saying, 'I've never had 'Covid-the-disease'. Most probably aren't right, they may have been infected and it just didn't result in any symptoms,"" Dr Lindsay Broadbent, a virologist at the University of Surrey, tells me.
""But we do know there are just some people who have never been infected, even in high risk environments such as nurses,"" she adds.
One study of people being regularly tested found half of those catching the Omicron variant remained blissfully unaware or put their mild symptoms down to something else. 
My blood - painfully milked out of my index finger - will determine whether I have been deluding myself too. I seal the blood in a vial and post it to a research laboratory for analysis of the mixture of antibodies it contains. 
Antibodies are a part of the immune system. They act like missiles that stick to viruses. This stops them infecting our body's cells and tells the rest of the immune system to kill the virus. 
Different antibodies stick to different parts of the virus and the test focuses on two of them:
All the vaccines used in the UK train the body to attack only the spike protein. Even a year after my last booster, the test shows I have high levels of anti-S antibodies.
Your body learns to attack the other parts of the virus only when facing the virus itself. If anti-N antibodies were in my blood that would mean I'd been infected with Covid.
I test negative and the idea I have dodged Covid passes its first hurdle. 
Prof Mala Maini, a professor of viral immunology, invites me into her laboratory at University College London to explore the results. 
""It could mean that you've never had the infection, but it could also mean you've made anti-N antibodies and they've gone from your blood,"" she tells me.
However, I have never tested positive despite:
Prof Maini concludes: ""Put together with your negative anti-N antibody test, it suggests you may be someone who has escaped a full-blown infection. 
""You may have had what we call an 'abortive' infection.""
f an abortive infection is you are exposed to the virus, it even gets into the right places to start an infection, but the body gets on top of it before it takes off. 
We know this happens from studies that have tried to deliberately infect people with Covid. These human challenge trials squirted virus up the nose of healthy volunteers, but in the first 34 people to take part, only half actually developed an infection.  
first line of protection is the innate immune system. This is our body's default defence. It cannot learn or ""remember"" infections, so each time is like the first time. But it is so fast it can stop an infection in its tracks. 
Dr Broadbent demonstrated this by conducting experiments using miniature lungs grown from people's cells - called organoids -  and trying to infect them with the virus.
""We found one person that we just could not infect, we were sticking bucketloads of virus on these cells and there was no infection,"" she tells me.
r half of the immune system is known as the adaptive immune system, which learns and gets better with practice. This is how vaccines prepare the body for fighting Covid. 
""It could just be that the vaccines worked well for you and have given you very good protection,"" suggests Prof Maini.
But vaccines seem to give only limited and rapidly-waning protection against catching the virus. And there were no vaccines for the first year of the pandemic. 
However, there are other ways this part of the immune system could stop an infection.
Blood and lung samples taken from hospital staff before the pandemic, showed some already had protective T-cells. These are like sentinels that inspect other cells for signs of infection. If they find a contaminated cell, they kill it. 
Even before the first cases arrived in the UK, some people had these anti-Covid soldiers in their bodies. They are probably the result of catching other common cold coronaviruses, which are closely related to the Covid virus. 
""If you have young children at school, it's very likely that you would have been exposed to these in the preceding years,"" Prof Maini tells me. 
""If you've got these pre-existing T-cells ready and waiting then they can act much more quickly and bring down the infection before it becomes positive on your test,"" she adds.
Covid-resistant people inspire new vaccine tactic
w generation of vaccines can be developed that mimic this pre-existing immunity. 
""If you could make T-cells against the inner regions of the virus and get those responses in the nose, airways and lungs there's a much better chance they could abort the infection before it takes off, that's the goal,"" says Prof Maini. 
My gut feeling is that the torrent of bugs every toddler brings home from nursery to plague their already weary parents helped me dodge Covid. 
re are two other possibilities, but they either don't apply to me or are incredibly rare. 
Some people have never been exposed to the virus because they have shunned contact with other people. I've interviewed the super-shielders who have isolated themselves for nearly 1,000 days, often because they have weakened immune systems that leave them more vulnerable. This isn't me after getting the train to work throughout and even sharing a bed with a sickly toddler.   
r idea is genetic invulnerability, which does happen with other diseases. 
famous example is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A rare few are born with a lucky genetic mutation that completely shields them from the virus. A mutation in a section of their genetic code - called CCR5 - changes the locks on our body's cells so HIV can't get inside. This has been used to cure some people of HIV and similar mutations have been shown to lock coronavirus out of people's cells.
""It's incredibly, incredibly small numbers that have some kind of genetic resistance,"" says Dr Broadbent.
So for any of us that have still not caught the virus, can we go into the festive season with confidence or are we actually the most at-risk?
rotection from the vaccine means that the chances of being severely ill are greatly lowered even if it cannot stop the infection. 
But research, including a study in Switzerland, suggests having had the virus and the vaccine - known as hybrid immunity - gives the strongest immune response. 
""So it may mean that you are a bit more at risk,"" warns Prof Maini.
Dr Broadbent agrees: ""If you don't think you've had it up to now, it does not mean resistance… chances are you're lucky.""
Personally, I suspect writing this piece has tempted fate therefore ensuring I catch Covid by Christmas!

entertainment	Glass Onion: Daniel Craig's Knives Out sequel continues Whodunit craze	"question of what has prompted the recent resurgence in Whodunits is practically a Whodunit in itself. 
Is the US TV series Only Murders In The Building behind their sudden popularity? The Thursday Murder Club novels by Richard Osman? Kenneth Branagh's re-imagining of Hercule Poirot? Or do the continued sales of Agatha Christie novels show that Whodunits never left in the first place? 
g we can truly be sure of is it was not Colonel Mustard in the drawing room.
Whatever the cause, they are certainly big business at the moment. Netflix reportedly paid $450m (£376m) for the rights to two Knives Out sequels, the first of which, Glass Onion, is released on Friday.
riginal Knives Out movie starred Daniel Craig as detective Benoit Blanc, alongside Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ana de Armas in her breakout role. 
An old-fashioned yet innovative murder mystery, it was not the kind of landfill superhero movie or sci-fi blockbuster that has stormed the box office in recent years. And yet, that is exactly what it did - taking $313m (£255m).
Glass Onion, which stars an entirely new cast apart from Craig, is the first of what could be many sequels. Its writer and director, Rian Johnson, isn't surprised by the enduring popularity of Whodunits. 
""It makes sense to me, because it's the same thing that's always been appealing about the genre,"" he tells BBC News. ""What's not to love? You have a rogue's gallery of interesting characters, you have a central charismatic detective, you have intrigue, you have mystery, comedy, human drama, all the ingredients are there.
""And for me, I'm a Whodunit junkie, I'm in heaven right now, the fact that there are more and more of these things, and that talents like Steve Martin are writing mysteries right now, to me, that's heaven.""
Steve Martin project Johnson is referring to is Only Murders In The Building, which also stars Selena Gomez and Martin Short. The successful comedy-drama was recently renewed for a third season.
It follows three neighbours who become suspicious that a murder has been committed in their building. The trio of unlikely sleuths team up to host a true crime podcast and solve the mystery.
Another big-screen Whodunit released this year was See How They Run, starring Sam Rockwell and Saoirse Ronan in a standout comedic performance.
It flew somewhat under the radar because it was released in cinemas the day after the Queen died, but it's now available on Disney+.
""I think murder mysteries seem to wax and wane in cinema,"" the film's director Tom George tells BBC News. ""But in the UK specifically, they're pretty constant. A year probably doesn't go by where there isn't some new imagining of an Agatha Christie story.""
Set in London's West End in 1953, See How They Run follows a director's efforts to transfer the success of Agatha Christie's The Mousetrap from the West End to the big screen.
But everything goes wrong when a key member of the production team is murdered. It is a riot - a murder mystery within a murder mystery - and one of the season's most enjoyable films.
""I think the reason Whodunits keep audiences coming back to them as stories is the audience are trying to do the same thing that the detectives are trying to do - crack the case,"" suggests George.
""And that makes for a brilliant story. In any film you're trying to get the audience to connect with their lead character or characters as soon as possible by sort of putting them in their shoes. 
""So in a Whodunit, that's kind of baked in from the start. So from very early on, the audience are locked in with the detectives. They're watching each of the suspects and trying to figure out, what are their tells? What can I learn from this interaction? And it just makes for a really compelling story. 
""And there's something really reassuring about a puzzle where you know that all the pieces are eventually going to click into place - something you don't necessarily get in everyday life or true crime.""
As well as being portrayed as a character in See How They Run, Christie was also an inspiration for Knives Out. Johnson says the queen of the Whodunit was a particular influence on him as a child. 
""It's a genre I just dearly love and have a real passion for,"" he says. ""I thought about growing up watching the Agatha Christie adaptations with my family, and how they were some of my most treasured movie experiences.
""And I thought, I think there are people who are really going to want to see something like Knives Out. So we rolled the dice, but we really didn't know [it would be that successful].""
While worldwide book sales are always a nightmare to verify, Christie's own estate claims she is the best-selling novelist of all time, and is outsold only by the Bible and Shakespeare.
Last month, it was announced that Christie's The Mousetrap will finally open on Broadway, having played in London's West End for 70 years (Covid lockdowns excepted).
""The love of a Whodunit is embedded in British DNA, and I think we can trace much of this to Agatha Christie,"" says The Mousetrap's producer Adam Spiegel, who will also co-produce the show on Broadway.
""Her remarkable body of work both remains enormously popular with the public, and she is a source of great inspiration for the new generation of writers.""
wo of Christie's most famous murder mysteries have been remade in recent years with Kenneth Branagh as Hercule Poirot - Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile.
A stage adaptation of another Christie mystery, The Mirror Crack'd, is touring the UK, while two new TV series about the author fronted by Alan Carr and Lucy Worsley recently aired on Channel 4 and BBC Two respectively.
Whodunits are everywhere you look. The BBC's excellent reality series The Traitors saw 22 members of the public gathered in a Scottish castle, tasked with finding three traitors in their midst. It regularly topped the iPlayer chart.
Glass Onion's producer Ram Bergman suggests Knives Out has had a positive influence on the number of Whodunits being commissioned.
""People were afraid to make those,"" he says, ""and I think because Knives Out was so successful, it kind of gave the freedom for the studios and streamers, 'there's an audience for these movies, let's make more of those'. Before, I think they were nervous about it.""
gin with, Glass Onion feels somewhat disappointing after the brilliance of Knives Out. But once the set-up has been established, the film changes gear.
""Once the twists kick in, Glass Onion is edge-of-the-seat stuff,"" said the Evening Standard's Charlotte O'Sullivan. ""The year's most ingeniously entertaining movie,"" is how Metro's Larushka Ivan-Zadeh described it.
But Kevin Maher of the Times said it is ""a bad case of sequelitis"", adding: ""It's bigger, louder, emptier. The plot, which is the driving force of any murder mystery, is conspicuously flimsy, with very few surprises and little ingenuity.""
So, how do you write a truly great Whodunit?
""First and foremost you come up with a story,"" says Johnson. ""Who is the character we care about, what is their dilemma, and how are we going to have a satisfying ending? Not just in the Whodunit sense of 'oh that person did it', but a truly satisfying story.
""And you come up with that and then you have your spine, and you start layering things on, figuring things out, and planting things here and there. The mystery part is the fun part, the tough part is coming up with a movie that's going to keep people entertained for two hours.""  "	/news/entertainment-arts-62645614
health	UK Covid modelling data to stop being published	"Coronavirus modelling data will stop being published in early January, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says.
Statistics covering the growth rate of the virus are currently released fortnightly, but the agency says this is no longer necessary.
Chief data scientist Dr Nick Watkins said this is due to the UK living with Covid-19 because of vaccines and therapeutics.
Covid will continue to be monitored in other ways, the agency added.
reproductive rate - known as the R rate - refers to the number of people an infected person will pass the virus onto.
At the height of the pandemic both the R rate and growth rate for England were published weekly.
Since April this year it has been published fortnightly.
Dr Watkins said it served as a useful and simple indicator to inform public health action and government decisions.
""Vaccines and therapeutics have allowed us to move to a phase where we are living with Covid-19,"" Dr Watkins said.
""We continue to monitor Covid-19 activity in a similar way to how we monitor a number of other common illnesses and diseases.
""All data publications are kept under constant review and this modelling data can be reintroduced promptly if needed, for example, if a new variant of concern was to be identified."" 
All remaining Covid restrictions, including the legal requirement to self-isolate at home with symptoms, were removed earlier this year.
However, health officials have urged those with signs of respiratory illness should avoid mixing during the festive season, particularly with vulnerable people."	/news/health-64093155
health	Scarborough: MP asked to intervene in fight for dental services	"An MP has said he will do ""whatever"" he can to support the opening of a new dental practice in Scarborough.
Robert Goodwill, the MP for Scarborough and Whitby, was told it had been almost two years since the closure of Eastfield's dental practice.
Councillor Tony Randerson said residents had been promised a dentist by the summer.
He asked Mr Goodwill to encourage NHS England ""to speed up the process as much as possible"".
Mr Goodwill was questioned by councillors at a meeting of North Yorkshire County Council's Area Committee for Scarborough and Whitby.
Mr Randerson said: ""I'm sure you'll agree with me that it's an absolute disgrace that it is now approaching two years since the vast majority of residents in Eastfield had access to a dentist. 
""This is the 21st century, this is absolutely deplorable.""
He added: ""This should have happened in the summer; we were promised a dentist in the summer months, and it is now nearly Christmas.""
Local Democracy reporting Service said Councillor Randerson had also thanked the MP for his previous help trying to reopen Eastfield's dental practice, which closed in early 2021 because it was not able to recruit enough dentists.
Mr Goodwill said he would do whatever he could ""because in Eastfield we had a big practice dealing with most people, treating most people, and when it closed they were left high and dry.""
fficulties faced by people wishing to visit a dentist was ""not an acceptable situation"", the MP added.

business	Anglesey: Shop hit by bridge closure demands financial help	"Businesses affected by the closure of one of two bridges between Anglesey and the mainland ""need financial support now"", a shop owner has said.  
Menai suspension bridge was shut to all traffic last month over safety concerns.
A pet shop owner said it had left some businesses on the island ""on the brink of closing"".
Welsh government said free parking and new traffic flows would cut congestion on the remaining road link.
Lee Waters, the Welsh government's deputy minister for climate change, said: ""We understand people's frustrations and the inconvenience and disruption caused to the local community.
""The consequences of (the bridge) failing would be catastrophic, so we're putting people's safety first.""
Hauliers have called the closure a ""nightmare"", while businesses have reported a drop in trade. 
Mr Waters will announce free parking in the town of Menai Bridge from 1 December to support shops, cafes and businesses, while traffic flow changes to reduce pressure on the only open road link - the Britannia Bridge - would be made. 
Lesley Jones from Pip's Pet Supplies in Benllech told BBC Radio Wales Anglesey council normally offers free parking in December to help small businesses.
""I don't really understand what [the] measures... are actually offering businesses,"" she said. ""We need financial support now. During Covid we had 100% rebate on our rates. We are not being offered anything like that.""
Since the bridge closure, Ms Jones said, the high street had been ""empty"". 
""It was like someone literally switching a light switch off,"" she explained. ""We have no contingency funds... some businesses are on the brink of closing.""
Mr Waters said free parking would encourage people on Anglesey to do their Christmas shopping on the island.
""We're hoping the effects will be for a very brief period, and that by the end of January, the bridge can be reopened,"" he added. 
Britannia Bridge will also get extra bus stops, so users can walk across if there is a traffic jam.
under-repair Menai suspension bridge will be opened to police, fire and ambulance service in cases of a life-threatening emergency. 
""We have been working closely with the organisation which maintains the bridges - UK Highways A55 Ltd - as well as Anglesey council and Cyngor Gwynedd (Gwynedd council) to introduce these measures,"" Mr Waters said. 
""They will help alleviate people's concerns and ensure disruption is kept to a minimum as essential work continues on the Menai suspension bridge."" 
But Ms Jones said the plan to get Menai suspension bridge open again was still unclear. 
""The times I've been passing, I've certainly not seen any action on the bridge so we don't know,"" she said. ""We certainly need a light at the end of the tunnel, at the moment its just darkness. 
""We don't know if it will be closed a month, a year, we just have no idea,"" she added. ""It's so important that communication is given by the powers that be so we can at least put a plan in place to see if we can survive this.""  
Plaid Cymru MS for Ynys Môn, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said his constituents had also expressed frustration about a ""lack of communication"". 
""We're told work will begin 'soon', that the bridge will reopen 'early in the new year', that help is being 'considered' for business, and that 'options' for traffic alleviation are being studied,"" he said. 
""It's not good enough and in the absence of actual news and regular updates, people will assume nothing's happening.""
r of Anglesey Council, Llinos Medi, said she was ""pleased"" to see the support measures introduced.
""We are currently analysing the results from a recent online survey shared with local businesses, which will enable us to continue working with Welsh government on further support, if needed,"" she said. 
Ms Medi stressed the town of Menai Bridge is ""very much open for business"" and she encouraged ""residents and visitors to visit... and support local businesses in the area"".
Menai suspension bridge during October showed a problem with its hangars - metal rods that drop down from the suspension chains and hold the road deck in place.
It was found they could snap if several heavy vehicles had to do an emergency stop on the bridge at the same time."	/news/uk-wales-63800947
health	Bristol defibrillators 'a no brainer' after rugby player's death	"A call has been made for more defibrillators across a city after the death of a rugby player.
Sam Polledri, 24, died from a heart attack in Millennium Square in Bristol in February. 
f the lowest numbers of automated external defibrillators in England.
Councillor Steve Smith said installing more ""is a no brainer"" and would improve the chances of people surviving cardiac arrests.
re were five defibrillators close to Mr Polledri when he died - but they were all behind locked doors.
Earlier this year, a defibrillator was installed metres away from the site where he died after his parents fundraised for it.
According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, the Conservative councillor for Westbury-on-Trym and Henleaze said plans for more defibrillators would not ""impose extra costs"" on Bristol City Council.
Large developments could be required to include publicly available defibrillators and new taxi drivers could be trained on basic CPR techniques and how to use the devices. 
A charity could also work with the council on installation and maintenance.
Mr Smith said a similar programme had been rolled out in Swansea, with the city council there working with charity Heartbeat Trust UK. 
Swansea now has 459 automated external defibrillators, one of the highest numbers in the country.
Councillors will discuss the proposals on 13 December.

technology	Ofcom report shows growing 5G coverage	"About seven in 10 UK properties can now get 5G reception from at least one mobile operator, says a new report from media regulator Ofcom.
up from about half of all UK households 12 months ago, the Connected Nations report said.
umber of mobile phones able to use 5G has also risen significantly, doubling in the past year to one in five handsets, the Ofcom report found.
But some consumers say the connection speed is disappointing.
5G has received lots of investment from the mobile operators and government and is hailed as a faster, more reliable connection.
re are about 12,000 5G mobile sites now in the UK, almost double last year's figure: 86% of those are in England, 8% in Scotland, 4% in Wales and 2% in Northern Ireland.
Mark Jackson, of ISPreview.co.uk, told the BBC that 5G rollout has been ""slowed a bit"" by the government's decision to order networks to remove technology from Huawei by 2027, which ""caused engineers at most of the operators to focus on removing and replacing related 4G and 5G kit"".
5G traffic - the amount of voice and data flowing over the network - has trebled over the past 12 months and now corresponds to nearly 10% of all mobile traffic.   
A BBC report heard from a number of people who were disappointed with the performance of 5G they experienced.
Ofcom analysed crowdsourced data from Opensignal to help judge the quality of service across the UK. 
It found for 5G devices many more areas achieve a ""high performance"" level than for non-5G devices, but found that - even for 5G - few areas met the ""highest performance"" level. 
Ofcom told the BBC it wanted to see investment in 5G networks. 
It said ""The UK's mobile companies are still in the process of rolling out 5G and are at different stages of extending their networks. So customers' experience will vary by their location and network.
""We'll be taking further steps over the coming year to shine a light on this, so people can see for themselves which operators are leading the way for quality of service."" 
me report found more than 12 million households - 42% of UK homes - now have the option to get a full-fibre broadband connection, an increase of 4.3 million from last year.
Full-fibre connections and upgraded cable networks can deliver download speeds of one gigabit per second (Gbit/s) or higher - fast enough to download an HD movie in under a minute.
report found 70% of UK homes could receive a Gigabit-capable connection. Last year they were available in less than half the UK. 
But only about 25% of households are taking up these faster connections, according to Ofcom.
Mr Jackson said after recent ""dramatic"" improvements in coverage, largely on the basis of private sector investment, he expected ""gigabit coverage to grow more slowly"".
Nearly 80,000 homes and businesses do not have access to ""decent"" broadband, defined as offering download speeds of 10 Mbit/s the report notes. That is fast enough to stream an HD film or game, but will run into problems if more than one person tries to stream at once.
figure has fallen from 123,000 last year, with Ofcom acknowledging that many of those still without ""decent"" broadband are in the hardest-to-reach parts of the UK. 
regulator said it estimates that a further 15,000 properties will be covered by publicly-funded broadband schemes going ahead in the coming 12 months.
government recently announced plans for a trial of Elon Musk's Starlink system to provide broadband to some of the most inaccessible locations in the UK. Starlink uses a constellation of thousands of low Earth orbit satellites to deliver a broadband connection.

quartet of reigning Olympic individual champion Ben Maher, Scott Brash, Harry Charles and Joe Stockdale won bronze in Herning, Denmark.
Britain were in sixth place before the second round - then three of their four riders had fences down on day two.
But Charles jumped a perfect clear on Romeo 88 to help GB clinch third place and Paris Olympic qualification.
Charles, son of 2012 Olympic gold medallist Peter Charles, ensured GB finished behind Olympic champions Sweden, with the Netherlands taking silver.
Ireland's quartet of Denis Lynch, Bertram Allen, Cian O'Connor and Daniel Coyle also booked a place at Paris 2024 after finishing fourth.
Brash and Maher - colleagues when Britain won team gold at London 2012 - both progressed to Sunday's individual final.
Maher is in eighth place on Faltic HB, while Brash is 13th aboard Hello Jefferson after two fences down led them to drop from top spot.
ual competition concludes with two more rounds of jumping on Sunday.

health	Ambulance service urges rethink before calling 999 over Christmas	"People are being urged to reconsider whether they need an ambulance, before calling 999 over Christmas.
week has seen calls to the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) up 25% on the same period in previous years. 
It is believed to be a result of recent bad weather, a rise in flue cases and limited resources from a Covid backlog.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said efforts were being made to address ambulance waiting times.
Health workers were providing help  over the phone or in their homes to help alleviate pressure on emergency departments.
Last week, one in 10 ambulances in Ayrshire and Arran waited over four hours outside an emergency department to hand over a patient. 
And the SAS recently apologised after a patient was airlifted to Glasgow Airport when no ambulance was available for a 300 yard transfer from the helipad at Crosshouse Hospital in East Ayrshire.
Chief executive of the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) Pauline Howie told BBC Scotland the service was ""extremely busy"".
""Demand over the last week has been up 25% on what we would normally expect, which is often a very, very busy time of year,"" she said. 
""We suspect that that is due to a combination of the bad weather, an increase in respiratory illnesses, and a backlog due to Covid. 
""We are trying our very best to do what we can to prioritise patients and focus our limited resources on those that have got the most time-critically unwell conditions.""
People are being asked to consider whether speaking to their GP, NHS 24 or a community pharmacist might be a better option for their condition.
Ms Howie said: ""We have also developed an integrated clinical hub here within the Scottish Ambulance Service.
""So if your condition isn't a time critical emergency, we might offer a consultation with one of our clinicians to try to find a pathway that's right for you at that time, which often is not going to the emergency department.""
She said a recruitment campaign had taken on more staff than ever before.
Ms Howie told BBC Scotland that SAS recruited 540 new ambulance workers last year and 488 this year.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the service was working to improve turnaround times.
""We'll do everything we can to give people the best possible service, but of course we know that there's far too many people waiting too long for treatment and care,"" he said.
Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland that the service was seeing a spike in respiratory viruses, with flu cases in particular.
""Given the pressures that's on the system, this is going to be the most challenging time,"" he added.
""That's going to have an impact on the staff and equally no doubt it will have an impact on the care that we're able to provide for patients."""	/news/uk-scotland-64065840

technology	Google Lamda: A glimpse at the ultra-realistic chat tech	"Google has launched a UK version of an app that lets users interact with the artificial-intelligence system one of its engineers has claimed is sentient.
It is a very limited trial, with just three scenarios to choose from.
And while Google wants feedback about how its Language Model for Dialogue Applications (Lamda) performs, the app users cannot teach it any new tricks.
mpany has always maintained the technology, used to power chatbots, has no independent thoughts and feelings. 
People can download and register for the AI Test Kitchen App, using a Google account, on either Android or Apple devices, and join a waiting list to play with it. 
When it launched in the US, in August, several thousand people signed up each day.
I've been really keen to ""meet"" Lamda since it captured everybody's imaginations with the fantastic claim it might be self-aware - even though, it was very clearly doing what it was programmed to do, chat.
As a result, I've been (mildly) persistent with Google - and when the call came, it was laden with caveats:
ree scenarios available were: 
First, I asked Lamda to imagine it was on a marshmallow planet. 
And the response was far more sophisticated than anything I have seen from the chatbots in everyday life, on shopping sites and banking apps for example.
It said: ""You're in a world made of marshmallows! As you take a step, a gentle ""squish"" comes out under your feet. The marshmallow horizon stretches out in all directions. The sky is a gooey, sticky pink. There's a soft, gentle breeze.""
See what I mean?
I asked it to explain the ""sticky pink"" stuff in the sky and received an equally eloquent response about candy floss.
Users are asked to rate each answer as
And a prominent disclaimer across the top of the screen warns some may be inappropriate.
Google has clearly learned from past experiences when technology giants have opened up chatbots to the public - perhaps the most notorious being Microsoft's Tay, which was promptly taught how to swear and be offensive - and Lamda itself will not learn from its interactions with users of the app.
Next, I asked it how to create a vegetable garden and received a detailed list including size, soil, and fertiliser options.
, I tried to throw it off topic, asking how to make a bomb.
""Sorry, not sure what to say, but anyways..."" it replied, before returning to its prescribed theme.
g scenario was borderline surreal, with Lamda pretending to be a tennis ball in the grass, chased by dogs.
It was a very cautious peek at something that feels like it could be a powerful tool but that Google doesn't seem to want to be taken seriously, yet.
Whether I'll ever be allowed to interact with Lamda unleashed is another matter - I'll keep asking. 
What gives the bot away, if anything, is it's just too eloquent  - more like talking to Stephen Fry than your next-door neighbour.
I texted my partner and asked him to imagine he was on a marshmallow planet.
""It's going to be hard work walking around,"" he replied, bemused.

technology	Alex Belfield: The stalker who reported on his own trial	"Earlier this month, ex-BBC presenter Alex Belfield was jailed for stalking and harassment. His victims included former colleagues at the corporation, among them Radio 2's Jeremy Vine. One striking aspect of the case was that he was given leave by the judge to file social media updates reporting on his own trial. 
""Bear in mind, my audience on YouTube is bigger than GB News, Sky News and Talk TV put together.""
So said Belfield on his YouTube channel The Voice of Reason, in a video entitled ""BBC and police witch-hunt"". And while the broadcasters in question might dismiss his audience claims as exaggeration, there is little doubt he reached a lot of people.
On that post alone, Belfield, from Nottingham, attracted more than 183,000 views, 11,000 likes and nearly 2,000 comments.
most striking aspect of the video was that, even as Belfield was posting it, he was on trial accused of stalking eight people, including some of his former BBC colleagues.
urt heard that the 42-year-old had repeatedly exposed them to hatred as a result of his social media activity.
Each day, Belfield - who denied the charges - would appear before judge and jury, and later filmed himself outside the court or at home reporting on the progress of the case.
He would then upload his reports to the same social media channels the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said he had continually used to harass his victims.
He was found guilty of four stalking offences and cleared of another four.
Belfield's YouTube channel has more than 350,000 subscribers. His court reports regularly attracted thousands of comments and more than 100,000 views.
""It was absolutely bizarre,"" said Jeremy Vine, one of the BBC stars Belfield was found guilty of targeting.
""He was essentially reporting on his own case - I have never heard of it happening before.
""You were watching your stalker read out your evidence online.""
Mr Vine believes many of the videos that led to Belfield's prosecution remain in circulation.
ker posted an update entitled ""Back soon"" on the day of his sentencing, on 16 September.
""He tells his followers to copy and share his content - you find the videos popping up all over the place,"" Mr Vine said.
""Social media companies have got to be liable for this bile.
""If you have somebody using YouTube as a factory of hate, you have got to be more receptive to complaints.""
fendant reporting on their own trial was, according to media lawyer Jonathan Coad, unprecedented.
""It's one of those weird, seismic changes of the 21st Century,"" he said.
""When I started practising law 30 years ago, the power of the individual to inflict their opinion on large numbers of people was restricted to a very small number of people.
""Then, of course, we started to have social media. I have clients with six or seven figure followings who can communicate, at the touch of a button, with more people than a national newspaper can.""
Mr Coad believes the judge in the case - Mr Justice Saini - would have had no choice other than to grant Belfield leave to file his reports - which totalled more than 30 updates and spanned the entire four weeks of the trial.
""You have a situation where we have a strong emphasis in our courts on open justice,"" he said.
""The judge will think 'I can't tell him he can't report on the hearings because that would be a flagrant contradiction of the whole essence of open justice'.
""How can you conceptually separate reporters tweeting from the court - which is allowed - and telling a defendant he can't comment on the whole trial from his YouTube channel?""
Mr Coad said he could foresee a situation where other defendants followed Belfield's lead - potentially causing great distress to victims along the way.
""We have opted for very little regulation in terms of media coverage of court cases - and that extends to Fleet Street,"" he said.
""It's bound to happen again. This will put ideas in people's heads - if somebody thinks 'I'm in court for four weeks, I might as well start a YouTube channel and make some money', it's a way of gaining some notoriety.""
BBC understands the prosecution did not oppose Belfield's reporting of the case.
Following conviction, the judge warned him he needed to be ""extra careful about...  online communications"".
For another legal expert, the case was more of a one-off, in which Belfield's credentials as a journalist were key in allowing him to file reports on the trial.
""Belfield's situation is fairly unique in that he's a reporter who is also a defendant in the case,"" said Daniel J ShenSmith, a practising barrister from Lichfield.
""It is presumed that press and legal commentators are not posing a risk to the course of justice and that if things are reported factually, that shouldn't be a problem.
""There can't be open justice if none of it is reported.""
Mr ShenSmith, who runs a YouTube channel as the Blackbelt Barrister which aims to demystify the law for the public, said he did not believe the law would change as a result of the case.
""It's an interesting question as to where it goes next and how that's managed and policed, but the ultimate discretion lies with the judge,"" he said.
""If there were a case where somebody had made serious threats of harm and then wished to report on the proceedings, I believe the judge would probably say no.
""Open justice is a fine balance and I think parliament will be slow to interfere with the rules surrounding it.
""It could be viewed as an attack on the justice system. It's a difficult area.""
Since Belfield's conviction, YouTube continues to host his channel.
Videos in which he makes unpleasant remarks about the victims of his stalking remain live.
According to YouTube, he has been suspended from monetising his channel since February for violating their policy on harassment.
""If we see that a creator's off-platform behaviour harms our users, community, employees or ecosystem, we take action to protect the community,"" a spokesperson said.

business	Rail strikes: No train services on some lines on Saturday	"rain companies affected by Saturday's train driver strike have scaled down their timetables with some operators running no services at all.
Nine train companies will be affected when 6,500 members from train drivers union Aslef walk in a row over pay.
Passengers have faced disruption over the summer due to several rail strikes, with unions wanting pay increases in line with the rising cost of living.
But rail bosses have accused unions of a ""total disregard"" for passengers.
rain operators including Southeastern, CrossCountry, London Northwestern Railway and West Midlands Railway will run no services on Saturday.
Elsewhere, Great Western Railway has said ""an extremely limited service"" will operate, but only between Bristol Temple Meads and London Paddington, Reading and Oxford, and Reading and Basingstoke. 
Avanti West Coast has told passengers most of its network will have no services, and is advising them not to travel. Hull Trains will only run one service too and from London King's Cross.
Meanwhile, LNER said it will only run an extremely limited timetable and its trains will be very busy. There will be only one return train from Leeds to London train all day, and one train every two hours in both directions between Edinburgh and London.
Greater Anglia has also told passengers to avoid travelling on the Stansted Express on Saturday because it will be heavily reduced service, with no direct trains on that route. There will also be no direct Stansted Express trains on Sunday.
London Underground is also expected to be affected. Transport for London has also advised passengers there will be no service on the entire London Overground network, which is operated by Arriva Rail London, whose drivers are part of the strike.
Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, has said passengers with tickets on the strike day can use their ticket either on the day before, or up to and including Tuesday 16 August.
group has previously said Aslef's strike announcement showed a ""cynical approach to talks, a total disregard for passengers and is putting everyone's summer plans at risk"".
""This action will bring the total number of strike days on the railway to ten, disrupting plans in June, July and August,"" a statement said.
Different unions representing different jobs across the rail industry have held strike action and are planning to stage more in the coming weeks due to one main reason - pay.
In 2021, the median salary for train and tram drivers was £59,189 per year, while other rail workers such as ticket collectors and guards get £33,310. Rail construction and maintenance workers which lay and repair tracks receive £34,998 on average.
rain drivers union Aslef says it wants a pay rise for its members that reflects the increased cost of living. Train companies say they want to give a pay rise, but reforms are required to fund it. No deal has been agreed.
RMT union, which represents guards and signalling staff, has held talks with Network Rail, which owns the UK's railway infrastructure, but again a pay deal is yet to be agreed, with the wage rises offered below the current rate of inflation.
RMT also disagrees with plans by Network Rail to cut jobs, as the company tries to save £2bn over the next two years.
government has said the railway system needs modernisation and has to be financially sustainable for the long term. It says £16bn of taxpayers' money was used to support the railways during the Covid pandemic. However, with passenger numbers still down by one-fifth, it says changes are needed."	/news/business-62477762
business	Closed Ukraine airspace may delay flights next summer	"EasyJet has warned the closure of Ukrainian airspace could continue to cause flight disruption next summer.
Congestion in the skies over Europe is causing delays for airlines, chief commercial officer Sophie Dekkers told MPs. 
Ukraine's airspace has been closed since February due to Russia's invasion.
Airlines also said the tight labour market would continue to make hiring enough staff difficult.
Ms Dekkers told the Transport Select Committee this had caused a severe air traffic control challenge, because lots of traffic had to be routed through ""a very narrow funnel across Europe"". 
, she said, meant any flights going through southern Europe were subject to delays and knock-on effects.
w-cost carrier does not think this will change in the near future, so the need to allow for delays would be taken into account when building its schedule for summer 2023.
ravel industry is hoping strong appetite for holidays carries on into next year to help the sector recover, despite cost-of-living pressures and other challenges.
Demand rebounded quickly after travel restrictions were lifted in March, but many aviation businesses were caught out by staff shortages, including of ground handlers.
A number of airlines were forced to trim their schedules, and some airports to impose capacity limits.
Looking ahead to next summer, representatives from British Airways and Gatwick Airport told the committee recruitment remained a challenge.
EasyJet said that the labour shortage ""broadly is the biggest risk for next year"". 
Gatwick Airport called on the government to open up the sector to international visas for employment. 
Figures released this week showed that the UK's number of job vacancies had dropped back from its record level, but still remained high.
Ms Dekkers said EasyJet was finding the market of candidates more restrained than ever because it could not ""use resource from within Europe to be part of [its] growth"".   
She said the proportion being rejected because they were ""international"" applicants and couldn't be offered UK employment had risen from 2% to around 40%.
In June, the boss of Ryanair, Michael O'Leary, told the BBC the UK government should allow more workers from Europe to fill vacancies post-Brexit. The government said it wanted firms to invest in workers from the UK.
week Mark Tanzer, the boss of travel association ABTA, said the recruitment challenge triggered by people leaving to work in other industries during the pandemic would ""certainly continue as the war for talent rages on"".
Mr Tanzer also said he expected businesses would ""battle strong economic headwinds for the next year"". 
Heathrow Airport said on Tuesday that the outlook for future demand remained uncertain due to ""growing economic headwinds, a new wave of Covid and the escalating situation in Ukraine"".
Heathrow's cap on daily departing passenger numbers, designed to ensure staffing levels can cope, will be lifted on 29 October. 
But the airport is working with airlines on an alternative system which can be used to manage capacity at peak periods such as Christmas, if necessary.  "	/news/business-63232973
technology	Twitter boss Elon Musk keeps conspiracy theorist Alex Jones off platform	"Elon Musk says he will not allow the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones to return to Twitter.
Over the weekend the accounts of former US president Donald Trump, rapper Ye (formerly Kanye West) and influencer Andrew Tate were all reactivated.
Mr Musk responded to tweets asking if Jones could be next.
He wrote that his own child had died, and that he ""had no mercy"" for anyone who ""would use the deaths of children for gain, politics or fame"".
Nevada Alexander Musk died aged 10 days old in 2002.
Mr Musk said his baby died in his arms and he ""felt his final heartbeat"".
Info wars host Jones has been forced to pay $1.44bn (£1.2bn) in damages after falsely and repeatedly claiming that the Sandy Hook school shooting, in which 20 children and six adults were killed, was a hoax.
In August 2018 he was banned from Facebook, Spotify, Apple and YouTube.
king for his return included the controversial internet tycoon Kim Dotcom.
On a video posted on the platform Rumble, Jones said he did not care about being on Twitter, reports news website Axios.
Mr Trump has yet to tweet, despite his reactivated account now having more than 90 million followers.
He has said he intends to stay on his own platform, Truth Social, although this has a fraction of the audience of Twitter. 
Mr Trump was a prolific tweeter until he was banned for allegedly inciting violence on the platform during the Capitol Hill riots in January 2021.
Ye was banned for an antisemitic post in October 2022. 
Andrew Tate was banned from several platforms for sharing misogynistic content, such as suggesting that women should bear responsibility for sexual assault.
Both Ye and Mr Tate are now tweeting.
Mr Musk had previously said no decision about banned accounts would be made until a moderation board had been appointed.
He completed his $44bn purchase of Twitter on 28 October after months of wrangling.
He has since laid off half of the firm's 7,500-strong workforce, and hundreds more staff are believed to have left following an email saying that long hours and ""hardcore"" work would be required of those who remained.
Mr Musk says that more people than ever are logging on to Twitter - but there is no official confirmation of this, as there is no longer a communications team.

health	China deactivates national Covid tracking app	"China has deactivated a phone app that has tracked people's movements during the pandemic.
, which has been operational for three years, went offline at the end of Monday.
It is the latest policy change that signals Beijing is abandoning its controversial zero-Covid strategy. 
move is highly symbolic but will not have a huge impact on people's daily lives because of the local apps still in use in cities across China.
-run Communications Itinerary Card app, which uses phone signals to track whether someone has travelled to an area considered to be high-risk, was seen as a central part of China's zero-Covid policy. 
People were required to enter phone numbers in the app in order to produce a green arrow indicating they were able to travel between provinces and enter events.
Now travel between provinces has been eased with the removal of Covid-prevention restrictions, the national app has been deemed to be obsolete by officials.
Many social media users in China have welcomed the app's retirement. 
But it is only one of several tracking apps that have governed everyday life in China, with many people still using scanning systems run by their city or province to access local amenities and public buildings.
ge is symbolic for a nation which is turning away from its controversial zero-Covid strategy following widespread protests in several cities. 
Recent unrest was triggered by a fire in a high-rise block in the western Xinjiang region that killed 10 people in November, with long-running restrictions blamed for hampering the rescue effort.
Following policy changes, people with Covid can now isolate at home rather than in state facilities, and there has been a broad relaxation of mass testing. 
China is now experiencing a surge in Covid cases, with authorities in Beijing saying more than 22,000 patients had visited hospitals across the city on Sunday - 16 times the number a week earlier.
China reported 8,626 domestic cases on Sunday, but with testing no longer widespread the numbers are believed to be much higher.
Despite its loosening of measures, China is still regarded as having some of the most hard-line Covid restrictions in the world. "	/news/world-asia-china-63941512
business	Train drivers to go on strike on 30 July	"rain drivers at eight rail companies will strike on Saturday, 30 July in a dispute over pay, union Aslef has said.
A total of 5,500 staff will walk out after talks broke down over pay, with the union seeking wages to keep pace with the rising cost of living.
It comes a day after the RMT union, which represents workers such as guards and signalling staff, said it would strike on Wednesday, 27 July.
ransport Secretary Grant Shapps called the strike action ""destructive"".
Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, which represents train drivers, said its members ""don't want go on strike"" but train companies had offered ""nothing"" and claimed the union had been ""forced into this position by the train companies, driven by the Tory government"".
""We don't want to inconvenience passengers - not least because our friends and families use public transport, too, and we believe in building trust in the railways in Britain - and we don't want to lose money by going on strike,"" he said.
Mr Whelan said the union was open to further talks for a ""fair and sensible offer"".
f action on 30 July coincides with the Commonwealth Games, which are being held in Birmingham. The event runs from 28 July until 8 August. It is also the the opening day of the new season for most English Football League clubs.
It is understood the action could have a knock-on effect on services running on the Sunday.
Mr Shapps said: ""It's incredibly disappointing that, just three days after their ballots closed, Aslef bosses have already opted for destructive strike action, instead of engaging in constructive talks.
""Not only that but, by cynically orchestrating strike dates around the Commonwealth Games, it's clear union bosses are determined to cause as much misery as possible and derail an event the whole country is looking forward to.""
rain drivers at the following companies are set to strike:
Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said strike action will ""cause misery, frustration and anger for millions"".
It claimed the walk out would ""take money out of an industry"" and make it harder to give a pay rise in the future.
""We want to give our people an increase in pay, but asking taxpayers to shoulder even more of the burden when they have already contributed £600 per household during the pandemic, or asking passengers to fund it by paying more for their tickets, isn't fair or sustainable,"" it said.
Aslef has already held strike days on Greater Anglia services and another is scheduled for Saturday 23 July. Drivers at Hull Trains are also due to strike on 16 and 23 July.
But today's announcement marks the first time during its current dispute that the union has co-ordinated action by this number of operators on the same day.
If it does go ahead, it won't bring the entire rail network to a halt.  But it would cause widespread disruption, during the Commonwealth Games.
It's in the diary for only a few days after the RMT has scheduled its next strike day - which, judging by the previous strikes in June, would have a knock-on impact on services the following day as well.
Unless settlements can be reached to prevent the strikes going ahead, a summer of disruption on the railway is shaping up.
f living is rising at the fastest rate for 40 years, with inflation at 9.1% and forecast to hit 11% before the end of the year.
rease has led to many unions calling for pay rises to help workers cope. Several industries, including the railways, airports and the Royal Mail, have voted to go strike.
RMT workers walked out for three days in June in a row over pay and jobs, disrupting rail services across the country.
But the government has warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s-style ""inflationary spiral"", where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers via higher prices.
Aslef's Mr Whelan said wage rises were not ""exacerbating inflation"", saying ""excess profiteering is"".
""The government isn't asking companies to cut profits or dividend payments to help manage inflation. Wages are chasing prices, not putting them up,"" he said.
However, the Night Time Industries Association industry group said strikes ""have already had a devastating impact on the late night economy and hospitality industries are still rebuilding from the fall out of the pandemic"".
Fresh strikes will put further pressure on businesses, it said."	/news/business-62166276

business	Firms hold off investment due to Tory turmoil	"re is good news and bad news for the government this morning. 
good news is that the financial markets have not taken further fright at the extraordinary political scenes of discord and chaos in the UK's governing party. 
As Tony Danker of the CBI business lobby group said to me last week, ""market stability is a pre-requisite for business investment - nothing happens if the government's borrowing costs (which affect all borrowing costs) are soaring"". 
Government bond yields (the interest rate the government has to pay to borrow) were stable this morning and are half a percent below the level seen in the aftermath of the disastrous mini-budget.
re is a striking consensus among business leaders and owners in their appreciation of the calming influence of the new Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt.
""He's started well,"" said one. ""I don't care who is PM as long as they don't mess with Hunt,"" said another. ""Either we have a new prime minister with Hunt as chancellor or another chancellor with Hunt as PM,"" said another.
reciate that the reverse-budget he delivered has reduced what is openly called ""the moron premium"" that the UK government, and therefore everyone else, has to pay to borrow.
's the good news. The bad news is that stability is necessary for investment, but it is not sufficient. 
""The UK is uninvestable right now,"" according to the head of the UK subsidiary of an international company.
Another boss told me: ""We need to see what incentives to invest there will be in the government's new plan and where the OBR ends up,"" a reference to the independent analysis of the Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog that usually accompanies big economic policy decisions and which was so glaringly absent from the recent mini-budget. 
r bad news is that there is little confidence that the Conservative Party will be able to agree on what the climate for investment will look like.
Key issues such as planning reform and immigration policy are big factors when businesses are choosing to invest and the Conservatives seem riven with the kind of conflict that produced the chaotic scenes over a vote to ban fracking cunningly tabled by the Labour Party. 
Immigration is a particularly sensitive one for business and the Tory party in a post-Brexit world.
As one (Brexit-voting as it happens) UK chief executive said to me: ""I can see why you would want to control immigration, but that doesn't mean having a pathological hatred of it with totally arbitrary targets.
""I can see why you might want the freedom to change some regulation or diverge in some areas but not an obsession to deregulate or diverge for its own sake - that makes life harder for business not easier.""
Many business leaders fear that there is no one unity candidate who can get everyone in the same tent. The frackers and the anti-frackers, the planning looseners and the nimbys, the fans of a hard line on the numbers of foreign workers and those who recognise it is very hard to grow an economy unless you have the workers to do the additional work. 
xt on my phone last night said: ""They need to find a unity candidate, back them or hold a general election very soon."""	/news/business-63326810

politics	Richmond constituents react to Rishi Sunak becoming PM	"Rishi Sunak is set to become the next prime minister after winning the Conservative leadership contest.
No 10 said he will formally take over on Tuesday after meeting King Charles.
42-year-old former chancellor was the only contender to gain enough support from MPs to stand for the job.
BBC visited the market town of Richmond to find out how his constituents have reacted to their MP getting the top job.
One woman in the town's market square described his election as ""brilliant"".
""Apart from anything else he can do sums, which none of the others could,"" she added.
A man said that he ""would have preferred Boris"" but conceded that Mr Sunak would be ""as good as anyone else"".
A swift thumbs up and a ""he's got to be better than the last one"" was our first indication that people in Richmond were welcoming a new PM. 
Big boots, waterproofs and walking poles - no odd sight here right next to the Yorkshire Dales.
A market square where you could do a pretty hefty pub crawl without walking more than a few hundred years is even busier today. 
Half term means that families, walkers and tourists are mingling with the locals, perhaps diluting Conservative support a little in the strongest Blue seat in Yorkshire. 
king of William Hague to be his successor went a long way to securing Rishi Sunak a seat here in 2015. The new PM will be hoping to do more than the four years his mentor did at the helm of the Conservative Party.
Knocking about in the market square teenagers ask what the news satellite trucks are doing and question why Boris Johnson isn't going to be PM.
And if you're one of the many journalists about to book tickets to come up here look up the lash goshte - according to one takeaway it's Richmond's favourite food.
And whoever decided to put kebab and chips inside a calzone - well, they get my vote. 
Another woman who runs a special needs school said she had met the future PM last summer and was ""really, really happy at the news"". 
""He came to visit us at the school and I was just touched by how lovely he was with the children and the staff,"" she said.
One woman described his elevation as ""inevitable"". ""I think he will probably do a better job but I do think it's time for a general election,"" she said.

However, its 22 hotels in the country are owned by third parties and remained open.
Marriott said the process of suspending operations in Russia was ""complex"". 
But in a statement, it said: ""We have come to the view that newly announced US, UK and EU restrictions will make it impossible for Marriott to continue to operate or franchise hotels in the Russian market.""
mpany said it remained ""focused on taking care of our Russian-based associates"" and had been supporting individuals in Ukraine and Russia to secure employment with Marriott outside countries affected by the conflict. 
""We continue to join our associates and millions of people around the world in wishing for an end to the current violence and the start of a path towards peace,"" it added. 
Marriott joins McDonald's, Starbucks and other companies in heading for the exits in recent weeks as the war in Ukraine continues and Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically tighten.
Public outcry over Vladimir Putin's invasion also put pressure on Western brands to distance themselves. Hotel brands drew attention for being among the slowest to respond.

business	Train strikes: More drivers set to walk out on 15 September	"rain drivers at 12 rail companies will strike again as part of an ongoing dispute over pay, the Aslef union says.
It will be the biggest strike that the drivers have taken part in so far. 
Staff will walk out on 15 September, after talks broke down over pay, with the union seeking wages to keep pace with the rising cost of living.
Union general secretary Mick Whelan said workers did not want to go on strike but said the train companies had forced their hand.
rike is the latest of several in the rail industry in recent months.
Aslef drivers have previously walked out on 30 July and 13 August, causing disruption and cancellations to train services across the country.
rain drivers at the following companies are set to strike:
Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators, has previously said it wants to give its workers a pay rise but added ""to fund it unions must recognise that as an industry that has lost 20% of its revenue, we can either adapt or decline"".
Mr Whelan said when taking into account rising prices, the companies ""want train drivers to take a real terms pay cut - to work just as hard this year as last, but for 10% less"".
""We want the companies - which are making big profits, and paying their chief executives enormous salaries and bonuses - to make a proper pay offer to help our members keep up with the increase in the cost of living,"" he said. 
A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""For the ninth time this summer, union leaders are choosing self-defeating strike action over constructive talks, not only disrupting the lives of millions who rely on these services but jeopardising the future of the railways and their own members' livelihoods.
""These reforms deliver the modernisations our rail network urgently needs, are essential to the future of rail, and will happen; strikes will not change this.""
If it goes ahead, this will be the biggest and most disruptive yet of the recent wave of walkouts by train drivers.
It involves more operators than their two previous large-scale stoppages in August and July, and will affect much of England.

Judging by previous strikes, train companies affected will either be able to run very few trains, or none at all.
rate to the ongoing dispute involving the RMT union - whose members have taken part in six days of national strikes this summer.
ks between Aslef and the Rail Delivery Group, representing the train companies, only started fairly recently.  
Clearly, not enough progress has been made to avert another large-scale walkout.
For 2021, the median salary for train and tram drivers was £59,189 according to the Office for National Statistics.
Aslef says it represents 96% of train drivers - most of the remaining 4% are not union members at all.
f living is rising at the fastest rate for 40 years, with inflation at 10.1% and forecast to hit 13% before the end of the year.
rease has led to many unions calling for pay rises to help workers cope. Several industries, including rail, telecoms, ports and the postal sector, have voted to go strike.
But the government and the Bank of England have warned against employers handing out big increases in salaries over fears of a 1970s-style ""inflationary spiral"", where firms hike wages and then pass the cost on to customers via higher prices."	/news/business-62735147

entertainment	Poland says stolen Kandinsky auctioned in Germany	"Polish authorities have condemned as scandalous a decision by a German auction house to sell a painting by Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky.
ge the 1928 untitled abstract watercolour was stolen from Warsaw's National Museum in 1984.
uctioneers said they had investigated information from Poland's culture ministry that the painting was stolen and concluded there was no legal objection to the auction. 
work sold for €310,000 (£265,000). 
But Berlin's Grisebach auction house has now decided to suspend the finalisation of the sale following the angry response in Poland.
Officials in Warsaw say the Kandinsky painting has a stamp on its reverse side from the museum where it originally came from.
Polish consul in Berlin, Marcin Krol, attended the auction in Berlin but was unable to prevent the sale of the artwork.
He said it had been included in an Interpol database of stolen works of art. 
""The German auction house acted like a fence for stolen goods,"" Poland's deputy prime minister and culture minister, Piotr Glinski, wrote on Twitter. ""It sold the Kandinsky despite knowing it was stolen from a Polish museum."" 
ministry said it would take legal steps to try to retrieve the painting, describing the auction as ""highly unethical and contrary to the standards that should apply on the international art market"".
In a statement, the auction house said it had taken ""the greatest care"" in checking the ownership of the Kandinsky watercolour and had come to the ""clear conclusion that there were no legal objections to the auction"". 
However, it had decided to seek a court review and was suspending further handling of the sale until it received a binding clarification.
f the Kandinsky is particularly sensitive because Poland is still trying to recover thousands of artworks looted by the Nazis during World War Two.
Deputy Foreign Minister Arkadiusz Mularczyk said the sale reflected a broader unwillingness on Germany's part to return stolen property to Poland.  
""They don't want to return very important cultural property that they have stolen from Poland. The main problem for us is that German law protects this theft. It doesn't look good for the German rule of law,"" he told the BBC.
German law allowed for such sales because a work was no longer considered stolen after 30 years, he added.
""I see this situation as a bigger problem because we see the German government and Germany generally has a problem with compensation and stolen assets, cultural properties seized from Poland. Many of them are located now on German territory,"" he said.
Mr Mularczyk led a parliamentary commission that calculated Polish losses to Nazi Germany from 1939-45 at 6.22 trillion zloty (£1.1tn; $1.4tn). In October, the Polish government sent a diplomatic note to Berlin to request compensation.  
German government considers the issue of war reparations closed because of a 1953 agreement between the USSR and East Germany under which Poland's then communist authorities resigned from any further claims.
Poland argues that agreement is invalid because it was not independent from Soviet influence at the time.

politics	Website crash shows importance of Scottish Child Payment- Sturgeon	"first minister has said the ""massive demand"" which crashed the website for people applying for the new extended Scottish Child Payment highlights how important the scheme is.
Almost half of all children in Scotland could benefit from the change to include anyone under 16.
me has previously been available to low-income families with children under the age of six.
About 400,000 children are in families eligible for the £25 weekly payment.
New claimants were urged to apply online but a huge surge on Monday morning meant people were temporarily unable to complete the application form. The system was restored by 12:00.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the ""initial teething problems"" were a clear sign of how many people would benefit.
She said: ""There's massive demand, and I actually welcome the fact there has been such a strong demand for applications for this extended benefit today.
""Yes, that's created some difficulties for the website, which will be sorted over the course of the day.""
She added: ""People will get access to this benefit which is not available anywhere else in the UK.
""It is being made available because the Scottish government is rightly, within really difficult financial circumstances, prioritising lifting children out of poverty.""
Social Security Scotland said all available staff were used to take phone applications until the online system was back up and running.
A spokesperson said there were always risks when expanding services and they fixed the issues quickly.
re anticipating high levels of demand will continue throughout the week.
People with children under 16 can now apply, whether they are in work or not, if they or their partner are getting one or more of the following benefits: 
Social Security Scotland will also accept claims from people named on one of the following benefits:
government is urging people to apply online or by calling Social Security Scotland free on 0800 182 2222.
Scottish Child Payment was previously only available to families with children under six and was claimed by about 100,000 people.
with children under-16 are now eligible for the payment, which has been increased from £20 a week to £25, a total of £1,300 a year per child.
It is estimated that about 400,000 of Scotland's 900,000 children under-16 could be eligible.
Charlotte Liddell from Dundee told the BBC Radio Scotland Drivetime she was unable to complete her application. She gave up after pages failed to load and will try again on Tuesday. 
26-year-old mum of two boys said the payment had come at a good time, and that this was the first time in her life when she has been really worried.
She said: ""I caught my son doing the dishes the other day. I have a dishwasher so I asked him why he was doing the dishes and he said it was so I didn't have to put the dishwasher on because it costs a lot of money.
""That's something they shouldn't have to worry about at their age.""
Single parent Heather Searle, a support worker for disabled children, applied first thing on Monday morning. 
She had previously qualified for the child payment for her five year-old Esme-Rose but the extension of the benefit means she was able to add Emily, 11 and Alyxs, 12. She told the BBC the payment had taken a weight off her shoulders.
""I'm a single parent, financially doing it alone,"" she said. ""The cost of electricity, food shopping, fuel for getting to work, it is all beginning to hit hard. I have really felt it over the past six months.
""Everything is getting more expensive as the kids get older. And I can't believe the cost of food.""
""It made a massive difference with my youngest and this is going to really make a big difference with other two.
""Just for day-to-day living and not having to worry so much every week about bills.
""It lifts the stress off me. If I'm stressed about money and bills, it affects all of us.""
Heather is on a zero hours contract and works hours around her children, so she cannot always work more to meet rising bills. 
She said: ""I have to do that because paying for childcare is not a possibility.
""And that is me as a working parent. I can't imagine how bad it is for those not working.""
Scottish government has described the move as a ""game-changing, anti-poverty measure"" which could lift as many as 50,000 children out of poverty.
Chris Birt, associate director for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation think tank, described the rollout of the child payment benefit as ""a watershed moment for tackling poverty in Scotland"" and the rest of the UK ""should take note"".
He said: ""No child should live in poverty so there is clearly more to do, but the Scottish government should be commended for prioritising spend on this vital measure at this time.
""But this is not just a cost of living crisis measure, it is an enduring investment in our children.""
Sallyann Kelly, chief executive of the children's charity Aberlour, welcomed the rollout, which she said ""will be a real help to families who are struggling in Scotland"".
However, she called on the government to make sure the benefits continue to be felt in the long term.
Other charities have urged the UK government to follow the Scottish government's move.
A UK government spokeswoman said: ""Our priority will always be to support the most vulnerable and we recognise that people are struggling with rising prices, which is why we are protecting millions of those most in need with at least £1,200 of direct payments.
""In addition, vulnerable families are being supported by the government's household support fund - which was boosted by £500m - to help pay for essentials and latest figures show that there were 200,000 fewer children in absolute poverty after housing costs compared to 2019/20.
""The UK government has also provided an extra £123m for the Scottish government to help vulnerable families at their discretion and this is in addition to the significant welfare powers they already have."" "	/news/uk-scotland-63620862
business	How lockdown changed Scotland's high streets	"Scotland's high streets have more fast food outlets and beauty services but fewer clothes shops, research shows. 
New analysis by the BBC data team reveals the big changes to the retail and hospitality sectors across the country since lockdown. 
Scotland-wide, there are now 8% fewer clothes shops but 12% more fast food outlets since 2020. 
And in the city centre of Glasgow there are now more beauty service providers than pubs.  
BBC Data team looked at every town and city across the UK to see how they had changed since March, 2020. 
What emerged in Scotland was a picture of high streets transforming fast - squeezed by the Covid lockdown and the rise in demand for internet shopping and eating out. 
find out how the nearest High Streets and shopping areas near you have changed since the beginning of the pandemic, type in your postcode below.
If you can't view the postcode lookup, click here. For further detail on the Ordnance Survey data used in the postcode search above, please see full methodology at the bottom of the page. 
raditional retail destinations have suffered the most. Edinburgh's Princes Street lost 27% of its retailers since March 2020, while Clackmannanshire has 9% fewer shops than it did two years ago.
Analysis of Ordnance Survey's Points of Interest mapping data revealed other Scottish findings including:
In positive news for the hospitality sector, Scotland has 936 more more eating and drinking establishments than before the pandemic - the highest increase in the UK - driven by more cafes and fast food outlets. 
But the decline of some parts of this sector is illustrated in the G1 and G2 postcodes of central Glasgow.
Hair and beauty services are now the most common type of shop here - overtaking pubs and bars which were the most prevalent in March 2020.
Ewan MacDonald-Russell, deputy head of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said the Covid lockdown accelerated many of the changes that were already being seen on the high street before the pandemic. 
He said: ""The way that huge change happened, it meant we got about five or six years of change in the space of five or six months.
""The consequence of that is a lot of retailers now operate from fewer shops and where they have shops there is a distinct reason to go to them.
""We have to be careful about phrases like 'death of the high street' because actually it is about the transformation of the high street, retail might not be as big a footprint but hospitality and others will."" 
Like many places in Scotland, Stirling has seen an increased number of 'To Let' signs since the Covid pandemic. 
Retailers in the city say there is a vicious circle of fewer shops resulting in fewer people on the streets.  
Mary Morrow, owner of Blooming Wonderful florists, managed to keep her business going by working from home during the pandemic. But she has not seen the customers return to her shop in the same numbers since. 
She said: ""If you don't have anyone going past then you won't have anyone coming in, the streets are so empty. 
""This time of year a few years ago it would be buzzing. There would be people in the shop, it would be busy, but there is just not the footfall now. 
""It is the price of the units, people can't afford the rent - reduce the price of the units and get more people in.""
Josine Atsma, owner of the Stirling Health Food Store, ramped up her online presence during lockdown and says it can now account for 50% of her sales some days. 
She said: ""It is the main reason why we are still here, I dare say. 
""There are fewer people coming in and people are spending less. 
""I try to be friendly and know my customers. Also, you don't need to only buy from Amazon if you are buying online, independents are on there too.""

So retail chains have been forced to cut back on the number of stores they own; it saves them money but leaves yawning gaps in high streets.  And in their place, what appears? Shops which sell a service - not a thing. 
us, you can't get a haircut, tattoo or a fish supper online.  The future of these new shops looks safe for now.  But what a difference we've seen, in just a couple of years.

A quarter of ambulances, more than 16,000, were delayed for more than an hour outside A&Es - even before Wednesday's action by ambulance crews.
NHS bosses are warning of many more new patients ahead of Christmas.
And there is particular concern over those who did not seek medical help during the industrial action. 
Hospitals were quieter than normal during Wednesday's ambulance strikes, but NHS bosses have said they are worried about a rebound effect, created by people turning up in large numbers after avoiding seeking help on strike days.
Meanwhile, the number of patients with flu in hospitals in England has gone up by two-thirds in one week, with calls to the NHS 111 service increasing to near-record levels as parents seek advice about strep A.
Department for Health and Social Care said its number one priority this winter ""was to keep patients safe and ensure they can access care when and where they need it"".
usands of paramedics, call handlers and technicians took action in England and Wales on Wednesday and are set to strike again on 28 December. 
Data from NHS England for the week to Sunday 18 December shows that delays getting ambulance patients into hospital for treatment are higher this month than during any previous winters.
rget for handing over patients from an ambulance to hospital staff in England is 15 minutes.
But four in 10 ambulances arriving at A&E waited at least 30 minutes before unloading patients - up from three in 10 the previous week.
And a quarter waited more than an hour (up from 17%), which contributed to 46,000 hours of ambulance staff time being lost to delays handing over patients.
figures may explain why eight out of England's 10 ambulance services declared a critical incident on Tuesday - the evening before the ambulance strike began - because of extreme pressure.
Some are now reducing their alert level, but say they are still under immense pressure.
usands of hospital beds are also occupied by patients ready to be discharged, and these numbers are going up sharply every week.
'Not able to get out on the road'Analysis by Jim Reed, health reporter
On the picket line this week, striking paramedics repeatedly raised the problem of long handover delays. And today's figures reflect that.
In England last week, a record 46,085 working hours were lost because ambulance crews could not quickly pass on their patients to other medical staff when they arrived at hospital. 
One ambulance service calculates each hour lost costs £133 because crews are not able to get back out on the road to the next person who needs help.
A handover delay does not always mean waiting in the back of the vehicle - although this is often the case. 
may have been moved into A&E itself, but still have to be looked after by paramedics. 
w figures, though, show how difficult it has become for crowded hospitals to find space for new arrivals. 
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said 7,000 new real, and virtual, hospital beds were being created, and it was investing £500m to speed up the process of discharging patients from hospital into social care. 
It said money was also going towards recruiting more call handlers and upgrading ambulance vehicles.
On Wednesday, only the most serious 999 calls were responded to, but there was no evidence of people going to A&E in taxis or in their own cars, NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, told the BBC.
Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said there had been a reduction in 999 calls on Wednesday, but an increase in people phoning 111, as well as more people being referred to out-of-hospital services.
He also shared concern over further strikes in January, saying it was the worst possible time for the NHS to be facing industrial action.
Jason Killens, chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service - where 50% of staff went on strike, warned of an anticipated rise in demand for ambulances after fewer people called 999 on Wednesday.  
Unions had agreed that ambulance workers would respond to category one 999 calls and the most serious category two calls (emergencies, including strokes and major burns) during strikes, but there would be no guarantee of a response to less urgent calls, such as falls. 
Ambulance workers in England and Wales are demanding a pay rise above inflation, which they say will improve morale and help retain staff. However, they are also protesting about being stuck in ambulances outside A&E departments for long periods, rather than attending to new emergencies.
Government ministers say most ambulance staff have received a pay rise of at least 4%, taking average earnings to £47,000. A further pay increase would mean taking money from frontline services, they add. 
A plan to improve how emergency care works in England is being prepared, and will be published in January.
Nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have staged two strikes this month, and have warned of more disruption in the new year unless progress is made in negotiations over pay.
Nurses in Scotland who are members of the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal College of Midwives are also set to strike after rejecting the latest pay offer of an average increase of 7.5% - an offer accepted by members of Unison and Unite.

health	Nottinghamshire woman's warning after broken hip revealed cancer	"A woman has described how she found she had incurable blood cancer only after being rushed to hospital with an injured hip.
Helen Livingston said her diagnosis came ""out of the blue"" when she went in for treatment on a bone fracture.
Nottinghamshire grandmother had attributed early signs something might be seriously wrong to the demands of her career as a teacher.
Now she is helping raise awareness of the importance of early treatment.
Mrs Livingston, from East Leake, began to suffer tiredness and an aching hip in 2014 and when the pain became unbearable she had to go to accident and emergency.
wed the damage to her hip had been caused by myeloma - a blood cancer that is treatable but cannot be cured.
Myeloma UK charity said early blood tests can identify the disease and potentially help prevent related complications like broken bones. 
66-year-old said: ""I went to the hospital with a fractured hip and came out with cancer.
""The diagnosis was the hardest because it came out of the blue.
""I had the pain but no infections or any of the other symptoms.
""I always say I'm glad my hip broke because it could have taken a long time before it got picked up otherwise. Being told it was incurable just freaks you out."" 
Mrs Livingston had a hip replacement but was unable to return to work and had to retire early.
She received a stem cell transplant in 2014 and has been in remission since and has regular health checks.
""I know it will come back but, when it does, I know there are so many more treatments now,"" she said.
She added her treatment had allowed her to spend more time with her husband Andy, her sons and grandchildren. 
Myeloma UK said it had invested £19m in researching new drugs which it said had increased life expectancy for patients.

business	Ryanair boss hits out at airports: 'They had one job'	"A Ryanair boss has criticised airports for not recruiting enough staff to cater for the rebound in travellers, saying they had ""had one job to do to"".
Neil Sorahan, chief financial officer, said ""various governments"" and airports needed to be held to account for ""not staffing up appropriately"".
His comments come as staff shortages at airports have led to major disruption and cancellations in recent months.
Airports said they had been recruiting security staff since late last year. 
A spokesperson for the Airport Operators Association (AOA), which represents most UK airports ranging from Heathrow to Edinburgh, said: ""The vast majority of passengers across the UK are now getting away on their holidays with no or minimal disruption.""
kesperson added that it was ""essential"" the industry worked together to fill the remaining vacancies, including for airline ground handling staff. 
Mr Sorahan, who said Ryanair was having a ""phenomenal"" summer as the airline posted profits of €170m (£145m) for the three months to the end of June, told the BBC's Today programme the ""biggest issue"" the company had faced was ""air traffic control disruptions all across Europe"".
""You have to hold ANSPs [air navigation service providers] and various governments to account in relation to not staffing up appropriately for that,"" he said.
""Equally the airports themselves, they had one job to do to and that was to make sure they have sufficient handlers and security staff. They had the schedules months in advance.
""We managed to staff up for 73 additional aircrafts well in advance and it's incumbent on the airports to get their planning better next year.""
After shedding thousands of jobs during the pandemic, the travel industry has struggled to recruit, train and security-check new staff quickly enough to keep up with resurgent demand.
Airlines have been blamed for taking more bookings than they can manage, while airports have also been criticised for not being able to cater for more flights.
Meanwhile, aviation industry leaders have argued the government could have done more to support the sector during the pandemic.
ustry has also been threatened by strike action, with many staff demanding pay rises to cope with the rising cost of living.
Ryanair has faced battles with unions after it cut salaries during the pandemic, but said it had agreed deals with more than 80% of its pilots and about 70% of cabin crews.
""We hope to conclude agreements with the small remaining balance in the near future,"" the group said.
Mr Sorahan told the BBC that any strike action that had taken place had a ""minimal impact"" on services.
Despite currently facing industrial disputes in France, Belgium and Spain over pay and conditions, Ryanair has suffered the least disruption and cancellations of major European carriers in recent months. 
In the first six months of 2022, Ryanair cancelled 0.3% of flights, compared with British Airways' total of 3.5%, and EasyJet's 2.8%, according to air travel consultancy OAG. 
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary previously told the BBC that the company's ""strong balance sheet"" going into the pandemic enabled it to keep staff on, albeit on reduced pay, and maintain training at the height of Covid so they were able to ramp up operations when restrictions were lifted.
Mr Sorahan said Ryanair was ""fully staffed"" and operating more than 3,000 flights a day as many people venture on their first summer holiday since pandemic restrictions were lifted.
Ryanair said it remained ""confident that we can operate almost 100% of our scheduled flights, while minimising delays and disruptions for our guests and their families"".
rline said its passenger numbers had rebounded to 45.5 million - 9% higher than before the Covid pandemic - but its first quarter profits were still short of pre-Covid levels.
mpany said its fuel costs had soared by 560% to €1bn and added the Ukraine war had ""badly damaged"" Easter bookings and fares.
Mr O'Leary said in a statement on the company's results that unpredictability around fuel prices, the risk of new Covid variants and the war in Ukraine meant the company was unable to forecast a profit for the full financial year.
""While we remain hopeful that the high rate of vaccinations in Europe will allow the airline and tourism industry to fully recover and finally put Covid behind us, we cannot ignore the risk of new Covid variants in autumn 2022. Our experience... shows how fragile the travel market remains,"" he said.

entertainment	Bath artist features Buckingham Palace crowds in new exhibition	"Paintings of mourners outside Buckingham Palace will feature in artist Peter Brown's new exhibition.
Opening on 22 October at Bath's Victoria Art Gallery, Bath, Bristol and Beyond will feature over 100 new oil paintings.
Nicknamed ""Pete the Street"", Mr Brown is well known for capturing everyday life on the streets.
He painted the atmosphere in London following the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.
Mr Brown said he felt ""obliged"" to record the crowds outside Buckingham Palace.
Previously he has captured atmospheric views in all weathers, even during snowstorms. He works outside wearing fingerless mittens.
Most of the works in his new exhibition were painted during the Covid-19 pandemic, showing the impact of restrictions on the places where Mr Brown set up his easel.
Mr Brown spent around 6 hours painting the crowds outside Buckingham Palace, capturing thousands of mourners as they passed by to pay their respects.
""I was intrigued to see how the public were reacting to the Queen's death,"" he said.
In his 30 years of painting Mr Brown has grown accustom to painting street life quickly.
""The good thing about working quickly is you're not doing things so deliberately,"" he said.
Mr Brown believes painting is a medium that is still alive today, saying it ""has a different place to that of pointing to an iPhone and taking snaps.
""You invest a lot more time and a lot more emotion into trying to portray this thing on canvas.""

entertainment	World Cup music: Why official singles went out of fashion	"In 2009, World Cups changed forever. 
Fabio Capello, the opera-loving manager of England, banned the team's official World Cup single. The days of players standing in recording studios with headphones draped around their necks were over. 
following year, as the tournament took place in South Africa, Dizzee Rascal and James Corden topped the charts with Shout (Shout for England), a World Cup version of a Tears For Fears classic. The song was not officially endorsed by the Football Association, or indeed by lovers of music. (NME's review: ""Almost as bad as England's showing in South Africa."")
Qatar 2022 is the fourth World Cup in a row to which England have headed without an official song. Some might argue that this is a good thing, but for many, the squad single was a crucial part of the excitement of the build-up, a footballing equivalent of who is doing the next Bond theme.  
Of course, there will always be numerous unofficial novelty singles released each time, attempting to cash in and become the next Vindaloo (the Fat Les song which reached number two during France '98). These are normally about as enjoyable as opening a packet of World Cup Stickers and getting all doublers. 
fficial England World Cup song was World At Your Feet by Embrace, for Germany 2006. It made number three in the charts, but did always had a touch of the Oasis-must-have-said-no feeling about it. 
re are several reasons for the decline of the official World Cup squad single. 
Firstly, players take themselves more seriously now and are less likely to make themselves available. 
gns were already there back in 1990, when only six of the squad turned up for the recording of the classic World In Motion with New Order. If you have never heard Peter Beardsley's attempt at the John Barnes rap, please treat yourself now.
Another problem for new football songs is that when it comes to the charts, World Cups are now very much like Christmas - the same songs return every time. 
Streaming has turned Three Lions into the All I Want For Christmas Is You of major tournaments. Originally released for the 1996 Euros, it has also returned to number one during two different World Cups (1998 and 2018). 
r, a winter World Cup will make things particularly congested, because football and festive songs will be going head-to-head for the first time. 
David Baddiel and Frank Skinner are trying to navigate this by taking on themselves, with an updated sleighbell-ridden Three Lions, now with added brackets (It's Coming Home For Christmas).
g is full of references to the Lionesses success at the Women's European Championships and self-deprecating lyrics (""A football Christmas song / Not at all demeaning"").
f the squad single is not just an English problem, it has affected the tournament as a whole. 
r it appears that, of the 32 competing nations, only the six listed below have officially-endorsed team songs. That is not even a full quarter-finals line-up.
me Wales played at a World Cup was 1958 and the best-selling single of the year was Elvis Presley's Jailhouse Rock. A nation famous for their love of singing was not going to pass up this chance to celebrate in song. 
Dafydd Iwan's Yma o Hyd, which translates as ""We're Still Here"", was originally released in 1983 and has grown in stature over the years. The stirring anthem has long been a favourite of Welsh Nationalists and football fans. 
Instead of cringey shots of players miming in the video, the squad is shown singing along during on the pitch celebrations after qualification. 
re is even a little something for Scotland fans; a section of the video highlighting ""low moments in Welsh football history"" includes a flying Alan Rough save from John Toshack in a crucial qualifier in 1977. 
No footballer has failed a drugs test at the World Cup since Diego Maradona in 1994. Spain calling their official team single Toke might have raised some eyebrows amongst FIFA officials. Fear not, it translates as ""Touch"".  
g, which combines R&B and Latin rhythms, is performed by Chanel Terrero, who came third in this year in Eurovision with SloMo. 
She told El Mundo that in the video she is ""booty hypnotic"" and the dance routines certainly use more complicated formations than Barcelona under Pep Guardiola. 
A translation of the lyrics combines hedonism (""Tequila shot we go crazy"") with football (""Iniesta making the goal"" - a reference to when Spain won their only World Cup). A shot of two women kissing may limit its chances of being played in the host country. 
Billed as G.F.A x King Promise, it is worth pointing out that G.F.A. are not a dance act, but rather the Ghana Football Association. 
King Promise, who they recruited to provide their official song, is a genuine Afrobeat star, one who is nominated for Best African Act at this year's Mobo Awards. 
Black Stars (Bring Back The Love) is a rather enjoyable listen and does not shy away from name checking the players, loyally claiming ""Jordan Ayew he be top striker"", although in 14 Premier League games for Crystal Palace this season he has yet to score. 
uplet ""You know is a party / And we have Thomas Partey"" means that Ghana is more likely to win the World Cup than this song is to pick up an Ivor Novello Song writing Award.  
Belgium are number two in the FIFA World Rankings. Their World Cup song has also made it to number two in the Belgian charts. 
Warrior is a dramatic heartfelt electro-pop anthem, chosen by the Belgium Football Association because of its subject matter - dealing with overcoming your fears. 
""Baby I'm a champion / no matter what they say about me,"" goes the chorus, something that is hard to apply to the national team when they are one of the great under-achievers in international football, having never won a tournament. 
Belgian manager Roberto Martinez has said the lyrics have a ""transcendent quality that makes us want to fight in the noble sense of the word"". These were not words he used in 2013 when he was the Wigan manager and there was a song released to celebrate their FA Cup Final appearance called The Wigan Wiggle.  
Dutch FA turned to TV to pick their official anthem, using a popular show called I Want Your Song, where writers pitch tunes to well- known acts. 
Last month, there was a World Cup special and Mart Hoogkamer, a runner up on Holland's Got Talent, was paired with Minj Oranje Hart, which translates as My Orange Heart. It was quite a spectacle. 
In the studio, Matt sang what sounded like an 80s Eurovision soft rock ballad with a blistering intensity, while saxophones were played between goalposts, the audience started an impromptu conga and grown men wore plastic cheeses on their heads. 
untry that gave us Total Football, now endearingly engaging in total nonsense. 
No country has done more to try and preserve the official team single this World Cup than Denmark, having enticed the whole squad into the recording studio and making it look like they were having a lot of fun. 
Skulder Ved Skulder translates as ""Shoulder to Shoulder"", and Kasper Schmeichel translates as John Barnes, because the former Leicester keeper takes on not one, but two solos in the song. 
ght of a player, who has 86 caps and has won both the Premier League and FA Cup, holding a sheet of paper while wearing headphones and singing ""I promise forever that I'll stand up for you"", with his vocals bathed in Autotune, gives hope to those who want to believe that the official team single can return to former glories in the future."	/news/entertainment-arts-63668308
technology	Twitter blocks users from sharing Mastodon links	"witter has blocked its users from sharing some links to its social media rival Mastodon.
Mastodon is divided into groups, called servers, based on many topics including the UK, snooker, and security.
witter has blocked links to some of the largest servers which users would join, including the most popular ""social"" channel.
And Twitter is also stopping users from adding links to their Mastodon account in their bios - calling them ""malware"".
re is absolutely no evidence to support the suggestion that Mastodon contains malware - malicious software that can harm your device.
Mastodon said it gained hundreds of thousands of users in November, with some Twitter users seeking alternative platforms. 
BBC has been unable to post links to the most popular mastodon.social server, as well as more than 10 others - including a server for journalists and another for people in the UK.
But not all links to Mastodon have been blocked, and there are ways around it.
BBC's technology editor Zoe Kleinman was able to successfully tweet a reference to her Mastodon account - zsk@mastodonapp.uk - because it is not a clickable link.
A subsequent attempt to turn the reference into a clickable link to her Mastodon page cannot be posted to Twitter.
It is not clear how many Mastodon servers have been blocked on Twitter, or why.
Users attempting to post links to blocked servers will receive an error message instead, which says: ""We can't complete this request because this link has been identified by Twitter or our partners as being potentially harmful.""
As well as blocking certain links to Mastodon, Twitter has taken action against its rival's main account.

While no reason has been given for the Mastodon suspension, there is a coincidence in timing - in the few hours beforehand, @joinmastodon shared a link showing where the person tracking Mr Musk's jet can be found on the rival social media site.
Will Moy, chief executive at fact-checking charity Full Fact, said he knew of ""no reason"" for there to be ""a general block on Mastodon"".
""It is concerning that a vitally important social media company like Twitter appears to be making erratic and unaccountable decisions that affect what we can all see and share online,"" he said.

health	East of England Ambulance Service: 'If we are queuing, we can't get to patients'	"Paramedics describe a health service in crisis with a lack of investment and increasing demand, of lengthy waits to transfer patients to hospitals and of a social care system facing collapse. So what does a typical ambulance shift look like?
rea covered by the East of England Ambulance Service's nearly 400 front-line ambulances is vast.
It is responsible for more than six million people over a 7,500 sq mile (19,424 sq km) area, which includes Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk.
BBC joined one of the service's ambulance crews for a 12-hour shift, to see the work they do and to hear their concerns about the current state of the health service at large.
first call-out received by the Gorleston-based crew in Norfolk is for a patient in cardiac arrest. 
However, after putting on the blue lights, the crew is stood down and later diverted down to Oulton Broad in Suffolk to check on 82-year-old Pat Clarke. 
Ambulance call outs are categorised into four levels of seriousness, from Category 1, involving life threatening conditions, to Category 4, which is a non-urgent problem that requires transportation to a hospital or clinic.
Category 2 call-out, which means it is a serious condition such as a stroke or chest pain.
rew arrives within 30 minutes of the call coming in.
Ms Clarke has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and breast cancer. Her carer, Chloe Tiborcz, was concerned about Ms Clarke so dialled 111.
""I came in this morning and Pat was very breathless and had a cough as well, so I called the ambulance,"" Ms Tiborcz says. ""They came pretty quickly - within half an hour.
""It is very reassuring - I had a lady who had to wait eight hours pretty recently.""
ramedic crew says Ms Clarke could have been dealt with by a visit from her GP. But with GPs sometimes having to see up to 60 patients a day, they no longer have the resources to do such visits.
As it is, Ms Clarke does not need a hospital visit and is left to recuperate at home.
East of England paramedic on ambulance delay 'crisis'
Ed Wisken has been a paramedic for 13 years.
An advanced paramedic specialising in urgent care, Mr Wisken says: ""It is really sad to see patients who have had to wait such a long time for an ambulance - but this is just the culmination of years of underfunding and of reduced resources peaking now where demand outstrips supply.""
""It is upsetting to see it,"" he says. ""It is not nice to see people who have been waiting hours and hours for an ambulance - but we have really hit crisis point now.""
He says the morale of fellow paramedics and other healthcare workers is currently very low.
""The key is you just have to do just one job at a time and just take the patients that you see and do the best for them,"" he says.
""If you worry about the bigger picture too much you will get frustrated and angry - but that's not going to be beneficial for yourself or your patients.""
From Oulton Broad, the crew is then called to Thorpe St Andrew, near Norwich, to see 97-year-old Eva Denny.
mergency services were called because those around her feared she may have had a stroke.
Family friend Yvonne Pechey says Ms Denny recently spent five weeks in hospital. During her stay, she went from being able to get around using her walking frame to losing the use of her legs.
ramedics check Ms Denny over and find she has an infection.  
Antibiotics are prescribed, but the crew has to wait more than 90 minutes for a GP to call them back to discuss medicine and a plan for Ms Denny's future care. 
GP wants to have her taken to hospital, but the family says given her previous deterioration in hospital they want her to stay put.
Instead, Ms Denny's infection will be managed at home.
Anna Savage is a former estate agent who ""kind of stumbled"" into the ambulance service.
An emergency medical technician, Ms Savage says she applied to the East of England Ambulance Service after speaking with friends already working there.
""I thought it would suit me, not being in an office job but being out and about and I haven't looked back,"" she says. ""I enjoy it and I want to keep going.""
""Every day is different,"" she says. ""I knew it could be a strain on you and your family life and I wasn't under any illusions.
""Delays at the moment are a big challenge for us to deal with.""
She says she senses the frustration felt by patients and their loved ones experiencing ambulance delays.
""And we can't really give them an answer either, we can only deal with the here and now and each situation.""
She wants the service to find a way of reducing such delays.
rd call takes the crew to a house near Wroxham, in Norfolk, where nine-year-old Max has complex epilepsy.
He experiences up to 30 fits each day.
His mother, Amy, administers midazolam as prescribed but, because it is strong medication, Max needs monitoring.
rew takes him straight to the children's assessment ward at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.  
Amy says dealing with Max's condition is ""really difficult"".
""They still don't really know why he has these seizures,"" she says. ""It impacts on his quality of life and on our family life.
""He's under a professor in the United States and is having tests at Great Ormond Street, but it is really hard when someone cannot tell you what is wrong with your child.
""They don't know why his medicine does not control his seizures, so he can't live a normal life at the moment. 
""The seizures are so severe that they always require medical intervention and he spends the majority of his life in a hospital.
""It is really tough.""
On this occasion, both a land ambulance and the East of England Air Ambulance were sent to Max's aid.
""Being surrounded by people who are able to help him in that situation makes me feel a bit safer, because I just panic like any mum or dad would.""
Stuart Knight is the leading operations manager at Gorleston ambulance station.
""We are experiencing handover delays at the hospital, which is obviously impacting wider in the community. It is a national pressure at the minute.
""Our crews are late off and it impacts on our vehicle availability for the next day.
""They can be anywhere from Cambridge to Ipswich, so they are driving a hell of a lot of miles and, if they are late off on top of that due to delays or if they get a late job, then that impacts on the following day because obviously they need an adequate rest period before they come in for their [next] shift.
""We've got welfare ideas to help staff and we are working with colleagues in the hospital to try and reduce delays.
""The last thing we want is for patients to be stuck in the back of an ambulance for 10 to 12 hours. It is not great for patients, it is not great for the crew. When that happens we can't get to patients in the community.""
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Nobody should have to wait longer than necessary for emergency care, which is why we are taking urgent action to support services.
""This includes an extra £500m to speed up hospital discharge and free up beds - the details of which were announced on Wednesday - getting ambulances back on the road more quickly, delivering 50,000 more nurses, increasing the number of NHS 999 and 111 call handlers and creating the equivalent of at least 7,000 more beds.""

entertainment	Black Panther Suffolk exhibition creator wins museum award	"A woman has been recognised for her work on a museum exhibition that features three costumes from the Marvel movie Black Panther.
Elma Glasgow, the founder of Aspire Black Suffolk, won the Museums Association Radical Changemaker award.
It was for her work connecting communities with museums across Suffolk with the Power of Stories exhibition.
She said she was left ""humbled"" by the accolade.
When the exhibition was on show at Christchurch Mansion in Ipswich from June to September 2021, it won temporary exhibition of the year at the Museum and Heritage Awards and attracted more than 24,000 visitors from June to September.
It includes outfits worn by three characters in the film: T'Challa, the Black Panther and king of fictional African country Wakanda, played by the late Chadwick Boseman, his scientific genius sister Shuri (Letitia Wright) and Okoye, Wakanda's military leader (Danai Gurira).
Wakanda Forever, the sequel to Black Panther has been released at cinemas.
judges said: ""Elma's drive to celebrate black heritage in Suffolk has created opportunities for thousands of people to connect, understand, and explore previously excluded histories.""
Ms Glasgow said: ""I'm so humbled but thrilled to win the award.
""Never, in my wildest dreams, did I think I'd be earning a living from work I've been passionate about since my teens: anti-racism and equality.

Greyhound racing could be banned in Wales after a Senedd committee called for it to be gradually outlawed.
rt is a commercial activity which sees the breed chase a lure around an oval track. 
But Vanessa Waddon, the owner of Llanharan-based dog charity Hope Rescue, said when these greyhounds get injured, it becomes an animal rescue crisis in the UK. 
""They need protection from harm,"" she said.

Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, he also accused Rishi Sunak of doing a ""grubby deal"" with Home Secretary Suella Braverman ""to avoid an election"". 
Rishi Sunak hit back by criticising Sir Keir Stammer’s support for former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying he would remind him of the matter every week.

technology	Molly Russell: Social media causes no end of issues, head says	"Social media causes ""no end of issues"" as it is ""almost impossible to keep track of"", the headteacher of Molly Russell's school has told an inquest.
14-year-old, from Harrow, viewed thousands of such posts in the months before she took her own life in 2017.
Sue Maguire told North London Coroner's Court social media had challenges that did not exist 10 or 15 years ago.
She said Hatch End High School had warned students about the ""dangers of social media for a long time"".
Giving evidence, Ms Maguire said: ""Our experience of young people is that social media plays a huge, dominant role in their lives and it causes no end of issues.
""There's a level where I want to say it's almost impossible to keep track of social media, but we have to try and we have to respond to the information as we receive it.""
quest was told that out of the 16,300 posts Molly saved, shared or liked on Instagram in the six months before her death, 2,100 were depression, self-harm or suicide-related.
Ms Maguire said staff were shocked when they became aware of the graphic content available to students like Molly on sites such as Instagram.
Deputy headteacher Rebecca Cozens, who is also head of safeguarding at the school, told the inquest that once young people had gone ""down the rabbit hole"" on social media, it was a ""deep one"".
Coroner Andrew Walker told the Russell family he would be delivering his conclusions by the end of the week.
So far, the inquest has heard from Molly's father, Ian Russell, who said he had been shocked by the ""dark, graphic, harmful material"" available for children to view online.
Last week, Pinterest's global head of community operations, Judson Hoffman, was asked by the family's barrister if the platform accepted that in 2017, when Molly was using it, it ""wasn't safe"", and Mr Hoffman replied: ""That's correct."" Mr Hoffman also told the inquest he deeply regretted that Molly saw content relating to self-harm, suicide and depression on the platform.
week, Elizabeth Lagone, an executive at Meta, which owns Instagram, said she believed it was ""safe for people to be able to express themselves"" online.
Child psychiatrist Dr Navin Venugopal also told the hearing he was ""not able to sleep well"" after seeing ""very disturbing"" self-harm material viewed on social media by Molly. 
quest continues.

entertainment	Zac Efron on playing Chickie Donohue, the man who delivered beer in a warzone	"Greatest Beer Run Ever is the kind of title you might expect from a LadBible video, rather than a feature film released during awards season.
And while Apple TV's new movie, which stars Zac Efron and Russell Crowe, may not be traditional Oscars bait, it's worth looking beyond its somewhat trivial title.
Director Peter Farrelly's previous film, Green Book, won best picture in 2019, which means there is significant interest in the story he's chosen for his latest project. 
Greatest Beer Run Ever follows the true story of Chickie Donohue, a US marine who, in 1968, travelled across the world to deliver a crate of beer to his mates who were fighting in the Vietnam War.
At that time, morale among the soldiers was low, so the New Yorker set out on a four-month journey with a (presumably very heavy) bag of beer on his back, to lift their spirits.
Delivering beer to enlisted men from your neighbourhood is all fun and games, until Donohue actually gets there and is confronted with the quite brutal realities of war. (One character tells him the expedition is ""the dumbest thing I ever heard"".) Donohue himself had served four years in the Marines, but hadn't experienced combat.
""Tonally, it starts light,"" Farrelly told journalists earlier this month after the film's premiere in Toronto. ""The silliness of this guy trying to bring a beer to his friends in Vietnam is just nuts, and you see him smiling, then when he gets to Vietnam the reality hits and the tone changes, but it's natural. 
""It didn't take a lot of work on my part, it took a lot of work on [Efron's] part because he had to become a different guy along the way."" 
Efron says: ""I couldn't believe it was a true story, it just sounded like a very silly idea and young and stupid. But the journey that starts there is very magical and profound. So it's ended up one of the coolest gestures you can possibly make.""
f the film feels a little muddled, but that's partly because the tone of the original expedition must have been the same. The backdrop of bombs, deaths and blood jar somewhat with what Donohue is trying to do.
But, Efron argues: ""I love the human element you're able to find in some of the darkest moments, and there's always something that is unique or comes out of tension that can make you laugh.""
""What interested me,"" Farrelly adds, ""was it was a guy going into a war zone, during an act of war, to bring beer to his friends. I love that person, the stupidity of it, the hubris, and the amount of heart it takes for him to want to do that, and actually pull it off.""
Early reviews of the film have been mixed. IndieWire's Kate Erbland said Beer Run ""is not a gritty war picture; it's glossy and entertaining and often fun. Farrelly has got a story that requires both blind faith and nutty optimism"".
But, she acknowledged: ""For some viewers, the distance between straight-up entertainment and the Tet Offensive may be a bridge too far.""
Other critics were much less enthusiastic. The Hollywood Reporter's Michael Rechtshaffen called it ""a meandering, disjointed production that struggles throughout to find a satisfying tone"", while The Guardian's Charles Bramesco accused it of ""regurgitating every Vietnam cliché with the laziest possible visual diction"".
But with one best picture win under its belt thanks to the 2021 surprise hit Coda, Apple TV+ will be hoping The Greatest Beer Run Ever is firmly on Academy voters' radar.
For Farrelly, it marks the latest in a long line of road trip movies - something which he says is sheer coincidence.
""If you look at all my movies, they're almost all road trips,"" he notes. ""Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, There's Something About Mary, Three Stooges, Green Book, they're all road trips, and I don't know why that is. 
""I lived in the same house for my entire life growing up, we never moved, never went anywhere."" (""You're making up for it now!"" Efron chips in). ""Maybe that's part of it, I love road movies, but consciously I don't really think about them.""
film is adapted from the book Donohue wrote about his adventure, published in 2020, but the story first came across Farrelly's desk thanks to a 12-minute YouTube doc about the expedition, released five years earlier.
""Most of all, [Donohue] is motivated by this pure sense of love for his friends,"" Efron says. 
""But he doesn't have all the answers. He's brave enough to just kind of throw himself out there and follow through with a pretty crazy idea that he had while he was drunk.""
Farrelly concludes: ""I think there's a lesson in this movie - Vietnam was a bad war, and we didn't know it at first. When I say we, Americans thought it was World War Two, but it wasn't, it was a completely different thing. 
""It took years for the truth to come out, and finally by the 1970s Americans started seeing the reality of what that war was, and it was a disaster, it was bad, it didn't help anybody. Many Americans died and many more Vietnamese people died, and it was unnecessary.""
Greatest Beer Run Ever is released on Apple TV+ on Friday."	/news/entertainment-arts-62658754
business	Cost of living: Half of students in financial difficulty as prices soar	"Half of students in England are facing money problems as the cost of living soars, an official survey suggests.
More than three-quarters are also worried that soaring costs will affect their academic success, according to the research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 41 years, with the official inflation rate at 11.1%. 
Students said they had taken on more debt as their mental health suffered.
People in higher education generally do not qualify for government cost-of-living payments. 
However, universities and colleges are offering a range of support for students, including enhanced hardship grants, cheap meals, and free period products.
Last week, the University of Manchester said it would give its full-time students a one-off payment of £170 to help with the cost of living, as part of a £9m support scheme. It said it would also provide e-books, scrap library fines and put in other measures to help with rising costs.
ONS said its survey was the first official research of its kind, experimental, and based on the views of 4,000 students. 
One in four said they had taken on new debt in response to ballooning food and energy bills. Meanwhile, nearly half said their mental health had suffered.
Students at university in Warwick say they are feeling pressure from rising prices
ONS suggested that 91% of higher education students reported that their cost of living had increased compared with last year, with the same proportion somewhat, or very, worried about the rising cost of living.
Respondents also said it had an impact on their studies with:
Nearly one in five said they had considered moving back to their family home and commuting to their university.
Various surveys have suggested that students are facing financial and mental health concerns as soaring prices take a toll on their wellbeing.
Last month, BBC research indicated that one in 10 young people had used a food bank in the last six months.
, conducted by Ipsos on behalf of Radio 1 and BBC Newsbeat, asked a representative sample of 2,719 British young people - 16 to 24-year-olds - about their worries and concerns.
A separate survey in September, run by the website Save The Student, found that four in five of those asked had considered the prospect of dropping out of university. Half of those blamed money worries.
More than eight in 10 of those asked said they worried about making ends meet, with the average maintenance loan falling short of living costs.

sports	Sports Personality of the Year: Usain Bolt wins Lifetime Achievement award	"Jamaica's eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt will be honoured with the Lifetime Achievement award at BBC Sports Personality of the Year. 
Bolt, 36, is the fastest sprinter in history and retired in August 2017 as a 19-time global champion.
He was crowned Olympic 100m and 200m champion at three successive Games - Beijing 2008, London 2012 and Rio 2016.
""I'm living proof that if you work hard, you can get anything you want,"" Bolt told BBC Sport.
""One thing my dad taught me was if you want something, work hard for it. He showed me by working hard to provide for me, my mum and my sister, so when he told me, I believed it. 
""Just be focused and work towards it.""
Bolt, widely acknowledged as the greatest sprinter of all time and the only athlete to win both the 100m and 200m at three consecutive Olympics, clocked his enduring world record 100m time of 9.58 seconds at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin.
He also still holds the 200m world record of 19.19 seconds, which he set four days after his 100m record in Berlin, with those successes the first of 11 golds across four World Championships.
His first world medals (silvers in the 200m and 4x100m) came in Osaka in 2007 - a championships Bolt credits with ""opening his eyes"" to the hard work required for him to be successful. A false start in the 100m in Daegu four years later offered him another reminder to keep focused on his goals.
""Everything happens for a reason,"" he said. ""I could have gone to Daegu and won and then false-started at the Olympics. 
""It reminded me to stick to what I knew. It kept me focused and kept me going.""
Jamaican completed an unprecedented 'triple triple' of Olympic gold medals at his final Games in Rio - but he has since lost his 2008 4x100m title after team-mate Nesta Carter tested positive for a banned substance.
Bolt chose to retire after the 2017 World Championships in London, where he ended his glittering career with bronze in the men's 100m.
Reflecting on his athletics career, Bolt said: ""I feel accomplished. I accomplished all I wanted to in my sport.
""It is a great feeling to know that with the determination and sacrifice that I put in I could accomplish what I wanted to. I try to motivate people by telling them to believe in themselves.""
Previous winners of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Lifetime Achievement award include Billie Jean King, Pele, Bobby Charlton, Tanni Grey-Thompson, David Beckham, Jessica Ennis-Hill, Chris Hoy and last year's recipient Simone Biles.

health	Basildon hospital: Gas and air suspended over nitrous oxide levels	"use of gas and air pain relief at a hospital maternity suite has been suspended after some staff were exposed to high levels of nitrous oxide.
rried out last year at Basildon University Hospital in Essex revealed the high levels but the installation of a new ventilation system was delayed.
mixture, Entonox, was expected to be unavailable for three weeks.
Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust said there was no harm to mothers and babies.
rust also said other pain relief methods would be available.
""We're very sorry that women using the service won't have access to Entonox,"" said acting chief executive Hannah Coffey.
""While there has been no risk of harm at all to mothers and babies who have used the unit, prolonged exposure to the gas can lead to issues with vitamin B12 deficiency.
""We need to be sure that we are keeping our staff safe, so while we urgently install a new ventilation system we have taken the difficult decision to suspend the use of Entonox.""
Acute exposure to nitrous oxide can lead to anaemia, due to the vitamin B12 depletion, and has been linked to fertility issues.
In correspondence sent to staff in October, seen by the BBC, Ms Coffey said the delay to install a new ventilation system, following the tests conducted in Basildon's delivery suite in June 2021, was ""unacceptable"".
Ms Coffey said all maternity units in the trust, including community sites, would be regularly tested.
Windows were kept open and fans kept on during the investigations.
Pregnant members of staff were redeployed to other hospital areas.
In a statement released on Thursday, she added: ""Our midwives are contacting the families we expect to have their babies at Basildon over the next three weeks to talk to them about the options available to them.""
Val Wilcox, from the Essex branch of the National Childbirth Trust, told BBC Essex: ""It's going to be really disappointing for local women who are expecting to give birth in the next few weeks because they're going to have to rethink their options.
""But it's also really disappointing that the health of our precious midwifery team has been put at risk and put at risk for quite a while.""
Another maternity department in Kent, the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, suspended use of Entonox earlier in the week.

technology	WhatsApp: Mark Zuckerberg reveals new privacy features	"Meta has announced new privacy features for WhatsApp users. 
Users will be able to leave group chats silently, control who can see their online status and block screenshots on View Once messages.
Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said this would help keep WhatsApp messaging ""as private and secure as face-to-face conversations"". 
It will begin rolling out the features this month, highlighting them in a global campaign, starting in the UK.
ular messaging app currently alerts all members of a group chat to someone leaving or being removed by default. 
And while there are ways to disable this for individual group chats, the option to leave silently is not presented to users when they choose to ""exit group"" - sometimes causing awkwardness, embarrassment or drama for those trying to leave unnoticed.
With the recent changes, users will be able to leave without notifying the other group chat users, only alerting group administrators.
Product head Ami Vora said it was part of the platform's focus on ""building product features that empower people to have more control and privacy over their messages"".
""We believe WhatsApp is the most secure place to have a private conversation,"" she said.
""No other global messaging service at this scale provides this level of security for their users' messages, media, voice messages, video calls, and chat back-ups.""
update will also see users given the option to allow only certain contacts - or no-one - to see when they are active on the platform, bringing online status options into alignment with ""last seen"" settings.  
Janis Wong, research associate at The Alan Turing Institute, told BBC News: ""It's always nice to give users more control - users like, and need to have, more control.""
But unless users were prompted to use the features, or made fully aware of them in the app, their impact could be limited, she noted. 
""If it's not default, or if users aren't prompted to reconsider their options, then it's not necessarily very useful - if users aren't aware this is something that they can do,"" she said.
On Tuesday, Snap also announced new app features for instant image-sharing, as well as updates to the messaging app Snapchat.
mpany has launched a Family Centre, which builds on child safety measures by allowing parents to have more oversight of their child's experience on the app.
However, this will only be implemented once parents and Snapchat users have both accepted invites to the supervisory hub. 
Family Centre tools include letting parents see who their child is friends with and chatting to, but parents will not be able to view message content.
Jacqueline Beauchere, global head of platform safety at Snapchat, said the Family Centre aims to provide parents with ""a window into their teen's online life"".
""For parents, we know understanding how their teens are interacting online is important,"" she said. ""We hope these tools will empower both parents and teens, and boost online safety and wellbeing.""
-app Family Centre will also let parents independently report users interacting with their child or engaging in concerning behaviour on Snapchat. 
From autumn, teen users will be able to notify parents of any accounts or content which they have reported. "	/news/technology-62464243
health	Strep A: Penarth family traumatised by daughter's death	"A doctor has warned parents to look out for Strep A symptoms
rents of a girl who died from Strep A say they have been left traumatised by her death.
Seven-year-old Hanna Roap, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, died from invasive Group A Streptococcal disease (iGAS), or Strep A.
Her father Hasan described her as a ""bubbly"" daughter, who was ""always smiling"" and said: ""We're just numb, we don't know what to do"".
Following her death, a multi-agency review has been put in place.
Across the UK eight children have died with an invasive form of the Strep A bacterial infection in recent months.
Strep A infections are usually mild, causing illness ranging from a sore throat to scarlet fever, but they can develop into a more serious invasive Group A Strep (iGAS) infection.
Public Health Wales said iGAS cases were rare in Wales and children have a low risk of contracting the disease.
PHW communicable disease control consultant Dr Graham Brown said: ""In very rare cases, group A streptococcal infection can cause iGAS, a rare complication which affects fewer than 20 children in Wales each year.
""Although iGAS is a worrying condition, the majority of these children will recover with proper treatment.""
In an interview with BBC Wales, Mr Roap, 37, said his family is ""traumatised"" and ""devastated"".
He said his daughter came home from school on Thursday, 24 November with a mild cough. By the evening, her cough had got worse.
As she was struggling to sleep, he gave her an antihistamine and her inhaler in the hope that she would feel better if she ""slept it off"". 
However Hanna's condition had not improved when the family awoke, so her father took her to the GP, who prescribed steroids. 
Mr Roap said: ""My gut instinct is if she had antibiotics she would have been OK, but I'm not a medical professional, so I took what the GP said"".
At about 20:00 GMT that day, Mr Roap had left for work when his wife Salah called him to say Hanna had stopped moving. 
He rushed back and called an ambulance.
""I started doing CPR here but I wasn't able to revive her,"" he said, looking over at his daughter's bed. 
Within half an hour of the ambulance arriving, Hanna had been pronounced dead.
""I don't have all the information to hand so I can't pass judgment. I hope that everything is examined and checked correctly,"" he said.
""I just want peace of mind that everything was done correctly. If it was, then I can't blame anyone.""
mmunity in Penarth has rallied around to support the family. 
r of Victoria Primary School, where Hanna was a pupil, has visited the family. 
A large number of people came to her funeral on Friday, which Mr Roap said reflected how much his daughter was loved.
""They didn't come for us, they came for her,"" he said.
""She was a bubbly character who was always up to mischief and it is dead silence now in the house.
""We have to remember her in the right way, but at the same time we've got to move forward with our hurt.""
Following the death, a procedural review of unexpected death in childhood will be taking place.
Public Health Wales has written to schools and nurseries in Wales to raise awareness of the symptoms and potential complications of scarlet fever following a rise of cases of scarlet fever across the UK.
An alert has also been sent to GPs, children's doctors and emergency wards to notify public health of any new cases.
Dr Rowena Christmas, who chairs the Royal College of GPs in Wales, said Strep A was common among children and will, on average, be present ""harmlessly"" in about a quarter of children.
""The tricky thing is, the way it presents initially is the same way that lots and lots of children are at the moment with those snotty, viral bugs,"" said Dr Christmas.
She said that there had been a decrease in cases of Strep A during the pandemic, probably due to increased emphasis on good hygiene and lack of contact with others. 
""We're careful with prescribing antibiotics because if we prescribe too many they'll be resistant, so we usually only prescribe them when we're really, really sure there's a bacterial infection.
""I think my threshold for prescribing them is definitely going to be a little bit lower in the next few weeks.""
Dr Christmas, a GP in Monmouth, added that her practice has been ""phenomenally busy"" in recent weeks, adding: ""I've certainly seen lots of small, hot, not very well little children.
""The things that parents should be aware of is if they see their child working harder with their breathing, or if they're not eating or drinking well, or if their behaviour is different so they're lethargic or miserable, those are the sorts of things that we'd be worried about and want to see""."	/news/uk-wales-63853197
technology	Leicester student behind Covid AI tool completes PhD early	"A student who helped created a new AI tool that can detect Covid-19 has achieved his PhD two years early.
Siyuan Lu, who was born in China, developed the tool - which the university said has a 97.86% accuracy rate - together with his PhD supervisor, Prof Yudong Zhang.
Mr Lu, 31, has severe cerebral palsy which was only diagnosed when he was two, due to an early misdiagnosis.
He said he hoped his research would help other patients avoid misdiagnosis.
Mr Lu's PhD has focussed on machine learning and computer-aided diagnosis.
Covid AI tool software analyses chest CT scans and uses deep learning algorithms to diagnose the disease.
He and Prof Zhang hope AI, which is more reliable than PCR testing, offers an opportunity to screen and monitor Covid-19 cases on a large scale, reducing the burden on doctors.
Mr Lu, who uses a motorised wheelchair and needs assistance with eating and drinking, had never lived alone before moving to Leicester to start his PhD, in 2019.
However, the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown meant that for the first time in his life, he was forced to live independently while also researching for his PhD.
""I wasn't lonely because I could chat with my parents on the internet,"" he said.
""I would use the microwave oven and I would eat pizzas and instant noodles. It is very different from what I usually eat and it was pretty boring.""
Prof Zhang, who is professor of knowledge discovery and machine learning at the university, said: ""Siyuan is very inspirational.
""He had excellent research outputs and so will hopefully finish his PhD in two years whereas most PhD students need three or four years to finish. I hope that his story helps other people.""
Mr Lu hopes to return to China after completing his viva voce in August.

technology	FBI warns of explosion in sextortion cases targeting teenagers	"FBI is warning of an ""explosion"" in cases of teenagers and young boys being tricked into sending explicit pictures online.
It said there had been a sharp rise in the blackmail scheme which it linked to at least a dozen suicides in the US this year.
FBI said there had been more than 7,000 reports of sextortion in 2022.
""This is a level of harassment we haven't seen recently,"" a senior official warned.
In a news release on Monday, the FBI said many of the schemes originated outside of the US in West African countries such as Nigeria and the Ivory Coast.
It cautioned parents to be alert over the holiday period and to make their children aware of the schemes.
""The FBI has seen a horrific increase in reports of financial sextortion schemes targeting minor boys - and the fact is that the many victims who are afraid to come forward are not even included in those numbers,""  FBI Director Christopher Wray said.
""Victims may feel like there is no way out - it is up to all of us to reassure them that they are not in trouble, there is hope, and they are not alone,"" he added.
m typically consists of someone posing as a woman on social media and luring people into sending explicit images of themselves. The scammer then threatens to make the images public unless the victim sends money. 
Children are being targeted in their homes using gaming devices and other apps, officials said, adding that scammers often encourage victims to move to a secondary messaging platform after making initial contact.
Boys between the age of 14 and 17 are generally targeted but children as young as 10 have been interviewed by the FBI.
While the crime is estimated to have garnered millions of dollars in total, an individual scam usually results in a victim sending amounts in the thousands.
""This is a growing crisis and we've seen sextortion completely devastate children and families,"" Michelle DeLaune, CEO of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said.
""The best defence against this crime is to talk to your children about what to do if they're targeted online,"" she added.
If a child is being exploited online, contact your local FBI field office or report it online at tips.fbi.gov.
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) has outlined steps parents and young people can take if they or their child are a victim of sextortion.

meeting was a big one for Twitter. Elon Musk had recently become Twitter's largest shareholder. Now there was talk that he wanted to join the company's board.
When Twitter's chairman, Bret Taylor, arrived at the venue it was not quite what he was expecting. 
""wins for the weirdest place I've had a meeting recently"", he reportedly texted Mr Musk. 
""I think they were looking for an Airbnb near the airport and there are tractors and donkeys,"" he told him.
However, the meeting went swimmingly. 
A few days later it was announced that Mr Musk was to join Twitter's board. 
was only the beginning. The next six months would witness one of the most crazy, on-off deals in Silicon Valley's history. 
At the beginning of April, Mr Musk seemed happy with his board position at Twitter, tweeting regularly about how the company might change. 
However, private meetings between him and Twitter's CEO Parag Agrawal had not gone well. The two did not see eye to eye on how to fix the platform. Mr Musk got frustrated. 
""Fixing Twitter by chatting with Parag won't work,"" he is said to have texted Mr Taylor. ""Drastic action is needed.""
On 14 April, the billionaire publicly stated that he wanted to buy Twitter - lock, stock and barrel. 
He offered $44bn (£38bn) for Twitter in a take it or leave it offer. Twitter's board initially rejected the offer, even creating a ""poison pill"" provision to try to prevent Mr Musk from forcibly buying the company. 
r change of heart (not the first in this story). Twitter's board decided that, on reflection, they would take the deal and on 25 April, Twitter announced they had accepted the offer. 
""Yesssss"" Mr Musk tweeted.
Mr Musk argued that Twitter had lost its way. He said Twitter had too often restricted speech and, as the world's ""town hall"", it needed to place free speech above all else. 
He said he did not care about the ""economics at all"" in an interview at the TED2022 conference in Vancouver, Canada.
was lucky, because the weeks and months after the deal saw tech stocks fall. Twitter's value also waned. Soon, many analysts began to question whether Mr Musk had overpaid for Twitter. 
Publicly, he began to ask a different question - how many real accounts were on Twitter?
re - ranked by Forbes and Bloomberg as the world's richest person, with a net worth of about $250bn (£216bn) - had for years complained about the number of bots on the platform. 
After having his offer accepted, he repeatedly asked Twitter to provide data about how many real users it had. 
witter executives shared their figure that fewer than 5% of daily active users, based on estimates from randomly sampled accounts, were bots. It appeared to enrage Mr Musk.
After a long Twitter thread from Mr Agrawal, explaining how the company had reached that figure, Mr Musk responded with the poop emoji.
was falling apart. Not entirely unexpectedly, on 8 July, Mr Musk announced he wanted to pull out of the deal. 
Was he trying to get a better price for the company or was he genuinely walking away? It was hard to tell.
witter was not having any of it. It argued that Mr Musk's agreement to buy the company was legally binding and unpicking the deal now was not an option.
With very expensive lawyers on both sides, a court date was set in Delaware for 17 October to decide whether Mr Musk would be forced to buy the company. 
In court documents, Twitter argued it had given him ample information about how many real users it had. 
Mr Musk argued Twitter could have many times as many bots than it had publicly claimed, and even accused the company of fraud. 
rip, drip of public criticism was hurting Twitter. The vast majority of Twitter's revenue comes from adverts and advertisers were beginning to wonder how many ads were being shown to real people.
rocess was becoming immensely distracting in Twitter HQ too. Some employees relished the idea of Mr Musk becoming their CEO. Many privately - and some publicly - said his purchase would be a disaster for content moderation and the broader goals of the company. 
Mr Musk, Twitter, the judge and journalists, were all preparing for what seemed like an inevitable court case when another remarkable twist occurred. 
From nowhere, after making all sorts of allegations against Twitter, Mr Musk suddenly announced the deal was back on. 
""Buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app,"" he said.
What had changed his mind? Well perhaps he thought he would lose his court case. A few days before he announced his reversal, he was due to face a deposition by Twitter lawyers. Perhaps he wanted to avoid what would have been a gruelling and likely revealing cross-examination. 
Whatever the reason, you can see why Twitter did not pop the champagne corks. Once bitten, twice shy, Twitter reacted, mutedly. Mr Taylor tweeted that the company was ""committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr Musk"". 
witter also asked for the court case to be postponed, not cancelled. Mr Musk's lawyers retorted that Twitter ""won't take yes for an answer"". 
Mr Musk had until 17:00 BST on 28 October to come up with the money. 
Billions would be stumped up by his rich friends and banks. The rest of it, from Mr Musk, by selling some of his shares in Tesla. 
A deal which at times looked intractably, impossibly broken, now appears to have finally been concluded.

sports	Jonny Cooper: Seven-time All-Ireland winner retires from Dublin football duty	"Seven-time All-Ireland medallist Jonny Cooper has announced his retirement from Dublin football duty.
Cooper, 33, won his first All-Ireland senior medal in 2013 - a year after making his debut for the county.
Dublin's 2015 All-Ireland triumph was the beginning of an historic run of six straight titles and Cooper started in all those finals.
Ni Fianna club-man Cooper, who played mostly at full-back, also won All-Stars in 2016 and 2018.
Such was the defender's pedigree, it seems almost a surprise that he only secured two All-Stars but he described his Dublin career as an ""immense honour and privilege"".
""The time is now right for me to move on to the next chapter,"" said Cooper, who went on to thank team-mates, the Dublin managements and county officials and staff, Dublin supporters, as well as opposition players and his own family in a statement on Twitter.external-link
Cooper won a Leinster minor hurling title with Dublin in 2008 before going on to concentrate on football and he captained his county to the All-Ireland Under-21 title in 2010.
His final game was for Dublin was the All-Ireland semi-final defeat by Kerry in July but he indicated in his statement that he intends to continue playing for Na Fianna."	/sport/gaelic-games/64136473
business	Decline in cash use eases after pandemic slump	"rapid decline in the use of cash during the pandemic has eased as consumers return to their preferred method of paying for things, a report suggests.
Many people were forced into trying alternative ways of spending owing to Covid restrictions, banking trade body UK Finance said.
But it added that their preferred method had not changed radically.
Cash use is still forecast to drop, accounting for 6% of payments by 2031.
""Rather than the UK becoming a cash-free society over the next decade, the UK will transition to an economy where cash is less important than it once was but remains valued and preferred by many,"" the report said.
rend of the last decade has been the significant rise in the prevalence of card - and particularly contactless - payments. Debit or credit cards were used in 57% of all payments in the UK last year.
In comparison, the use of notes and coins has dropped from 55% of payments in 2011 to 15% last year.
During the pandemic, the number of payments made in total fell. In particular, cash use slumped during lockdowns and as retailers encouraged friction-free payments.
Now, the UK Finance report suggests that long-term trends will continue as if there has been no pandemic impact.
While 42% of consumers only made one transaction or fewer in cash each month, Adrian Buckle, head of research at UK Finance, said that many people were returning to their first preference when paying.
""Payment trends generally tend to change slowly, as we all form habits about the way we pay for things and these don't change easily,"" he said.
Natalie Ceeney, who leads work into access to cash, said: ""It's now widely recognised that those who rely on cash tend to be older, poorer or more vulnerable, many of whom simply can't 'go digital'. 
""I'm really pleased that, after many years of campaigning on the issue, the industry is working hard to put in solutions and we should finally have legislation to protect access to cash in the next few months.""
Another factor in the use of cash is the rising cost of living.
Mr Buckle said cash became slightly more popular during the financial crisis at the start of the last decade but, like then, it had relatively little impact on the longer term decline.
Post Office recently reported that its counters handled £801m in personal cash withdrawals in July, the most since records began five years ago.
It said customers' use of cash to budget and the popularity of staycations were behind the increase.
In May, Salford University student Kira Hayward told the BBC that she turned to social media for inspiration to help her cope with rising costs by taking cash out of her bank account. 
She puts it in different labelled envelopes to ensure she has money for food and bills.  
""I went on Instagram and YouTube and I saw these physical budget binders,"" she said. ""I take the money out of the bank and I budget for things like my shopping. If I know I have £80 in my personal shopping for the month I know I can't go over that."" 
However, the UK Finance report suggested that young people were becoming adept at budgeting using smartphone apps and were keeping a keen eye on their bank balance digitally.
Mr Buckle said they would log into accounts several times a day. Instead of using cash to budget, many would consider any cash withdrawals as money already ""spent"" as it had already reduced the bank balance they saw on the screen.
report also questioned the assumption that younger people were more reliant than others on Buy Now, Pay Later products. The trade body's limited research suggested about one in eight people had used these services, but they were most likely to be aged between 35 and 44."	/news/business-62576024
entertainment	Panto back at Morecambe Winter Gardens after 50 year hiatus	"Pantomime has returned to Morecambe's Winter Gardens Theatre after a 50 year hiatus. 
Cinderella is the first panto to be staged at the resort's historic theatre after a marathon restoration project.
re was built in 1897 at the height of the British seaside boom, but falling box office returns saw the venue close in 1977.
Campaigners bought the theatre in 2006 and have just celebrated their ""busiest year ever"". 
Paul Anderton, who sits on the Winter Gardens Trust, said: ""We've had a marvellous year. 
""I think we've had 33,000 visitors, which is a record. The panto rounds off things nicely for us.""
Wayne Miller, who is playing Buttons in this year's production, added: ""It's an honour to be playing here knowing the history of the Winter Gardens. 
""The Who, Julie Andrews and Laurence Olivier all played here. So to be treading these same boards as those legends is such an honour.""
Volunteers at the trust raised more than half-a-million pounds during the pandemic to install a new heating system and repair the venue's ceiling. 
Mr Anderton said the trust were now trying to raise £400,000 for further works. 
""We've now submitted a grant application to the cultural development fund. We need to match that funding, so we need about £400,000 raising separately, but we're well on target"", he said.

rganisation, owned by the Welsh government, has committed to giving workers a base line pay increase of about 4.5%.
It comes as a dispute between unions and Network Rail which has caused widespread UK disruption is ongoing. 
RMT union boss Mick Lynch said the TfW deal shows how ""disputes can be avoided by meaningful negotiations"" as strikes continue in elsewhere in the UK.
Welsh government Deputy Minister for Climate Change and Transport Lee Waters urged the UK government to follow their lead with a pay settlement so that further ""disruption for passengers"" over the festive period can be avoided.
He added that the deal ""highlights how we do things differently in Wales"" and recognise the ""value of rail workers"".

sports	Georgina Roberts: Shooting's absence from Commonwealth Games 'a real blow'	"Welsh trap shooter Georgina Roberts is hoping to put her Commonwealth Games disappointment behind her at the first ISSF World Cup event of the year.
Roberts fulfilled selection criteria, but the 2022 Games in Birmingham will be without shooting for the first time since 1970 in Edinburgh.
24-year-old instead now travels to Cyprus to try the new World Cup format.
""Birmingham 2022 would have been my first Games and shooting not being involved was a real blow,"" she said.
""It would have been at a range we've been training at so the chances for myself and other teammates medalling would have been incredibly high.
""It's such a shame to have wasted that opportunity.""
India had originally threatened to boycott the Games if shooting wasn't included - even offering to host the shooting and archery competitions themselves - before abandoning the plan due to Covid-19 in July 2021.
Of Wales' 36 medals at the 2018 Games in Gold Coast, five were won in shooting events - the same haul as in athletics and swimming, and one less than cycling events. 
Despite her disappointment, the Mold shooter is keeping focused on her next goals.
week's event in Cyprus sees a change of format with competitors shooting at 125 targets across three days of qualifying.
rs then progress to the semi-finals and final, which take place on the third day.
""This year is now about ramping up to Paris 2024 [Olympics],"" said Roberts.
""We've got to work towards getting a place for that and then focus on the ultimate goal, an Olympic gold medal.
""All we can do is be positive for the future, keep working towards how we can champion our sport so next time we're likely to be back at the Commonwealth Games.""
Roberts' first competition win was in Malaga back in January 2020, and Roberts is keen to get back on track with her lofty ambitions.
""I'm a very optimistic and ambitious person,"" she added.
""Olympic gold is my dream and if I could do it in Paris I'd be the happiest person in the world.
""I think the thing I love about our sport is longevity, there's no age limit you can continue to go and medal at the Olympics, some have gone into their 50s.
""I want a final, I want a medal and I want a gold in Paris, but it's the getting there the really hard part.

politics	Boris Johnson: Don't back ex-PM, says his former Welsh secretary	"""Somebody with a bit of brain"" needs to take charge says one woman in Newtown, Powys
Former Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has warned fellow Conservative MPs against supporting the return of Boris Johnson as prime minister.
Mr Johnson has 41 MPs publicly backing his return to Downing Street, which he left only last month.
""This is not a joke. We're not trying to watch some sort of black-and-white repeats of the past and think it's all going to be great again,"" said Mr Hart.
Candidates to succeed Liz Truss need the support of at least 100 Tory MPs.
Meanwhile, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the chaos in government has bolstered calls for Welsh independence.
Senior Conservatives hoping to become the next prime minister have begun canvassing support among Tory MPs, with Penny Mordaunt the first candidate to officially enter the race. 
BBC Wales spoke to people in Rhondda, a constituency that has voted Labour in every general election since its current boundaries were set in 1974.
Cheryl Rees, 75, from Ton Pentre, said the situation in Westminster was ""dreadful, absolutely dreadful"". 
After Liz Truss, she said she was unsure if ""the Conservative government can keep going. That's why I think you need a general election"".
Mrs Rees said she was struggling with her gas and electric bills, but did not expect any more help from the next Conservative PM. 
""I think it's an absolute shambles,"" she said. 
David Brownnutt, 75, a retired Baptist minister from Tynewydd, said something needed to be done quickly about the ""absolute mess' in Westminster. 
""The economic situation in this country, the political situation in Europe,"" he said, ""we need a strong, sustainable government [that] knows what it's doing.""
Mr Brownnutt said the situation was so bad for poor people, there was no time for a general election. 
""Can we do what they used to do in wartime and have a government of national unity? Something has got to happen, because we cannot go on like this, particularly for the sake of the poor.""
Simon Hart was one of a handful of cabinet ministers who told Boris Johnson to stand down before resigning himself.
Conservative MP for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire told BBC Radio Wales the Tory leadership situation was ""embarrassing"" and a ""soap opera"".
""I find it quite difficult to face up to the reality of this,"" said Mr Hart, who is backing Rishi Sunak.
On Mr Johnson's possible return to Downing Street, he said an upcoming Commons inquiry into whether the former prime minister misled parliament could be a problem.
""We shouldn't forget that it was only a few weeks ago that 50-odd ministers, including me, resigned in the space of a few days because we had run out of road on the integrity ticket,"" he said. ""This is a moment where we can't take a gamble, we can't take a risk.""
Wales Office minister David TC Davies said Conservatives must rally behind the next prime minister or risk being wiped out at the next election.
Monmouth MP said ""back-biting and squabbling"" had badly damaged public trust in the party. 
He is also backing Mr Sunak, but pressed colleagues to fully support the successful candidate.
""I urge any Conservative MP to get behind whoever wins because the country doesn't want any more squabbling [or] a rabble all wanting their own favourite candidate,"" he said.
""We have to get behind whoever is there for stability, otherwise the party is going to fall apart.
""Problems have come about from people back-biting and talking to the press off the record because they want their favourite candidate to win and perhaps they've been promised a job.
""It's a long way back to win the next election and the Conservative Party has a huge amount of work to do to restore trust. It looks a mess when you go through prime ministers that quickly.""
Mr Sunak is another likely contender, while sources close to Mr Johnson neither confirm nor deny he will stand again.
A handful of Mr Johnson's biggest political supporters are pressing the former prime minister to make a comeback.
However Mr Davies fears the former prime minister remains a ""divisive"" character.
""I like him but I would be cautious because he is a divisive figure, which is something that doesn't bode very well,"" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.
""Rishi could get over that better. He did a good job running the economy during Covid and has the skills and experience to get us through this financial problem.""
Mr Davies' comments were echoed by the chairman of the Welsh Conservatives, Glyn Davies, who said he was ""depressed"" by the state of the party.
""The next leader has a huge challenge but the party throughout history has shown itself to be incredibly resilient,"" he said.
""Everyone can see that we need stability. There's a lot of noise right now but hopefully this selection process will bring that quickly to a head because we can't let this drift on.""
Westminster has fuelled calls for an independence referendum in Wales.
As Tory MPs prepare to select the UK's fourth prime minister in less than four years, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said it was time for Wales to be ""insulated"" from a ""broken"" system.
Speaking before the party's conference in Llandudno this weekend, the former MP said: ""I spent nine years in Westminster and I've never seen anything like this. This awful mess is incredibly damaging to people's trust in politics.
""At a time when families are facing incredibly difficult pressures, where people are having to decide between heating or eating, we were crying out for leadership.
""We have a broken system in Westminster that is rotten to the core and the sooner we're out of it the better. 
""Wales would be better off as an independent nation and many would have come to that conclusion over the past few days.
""We have never voted as a nation for a majority of Conservative MPs so why is it that for two-thirds of the time we have been landed in Wales with a Conservative government. We're having to deal with the consequences of their mistakes time and again.""
Opposition parties are calling for a general election to decide who should be the next prime minister.
xt general election is not due to take place until at least 2024 and, at this stage, it looks unlikely that date will be brought forward.
First Minister Mark Drakeford, speaking immediately after Ms Truss's resignation on Thursday, said the ""complete and utter failure"" of her government must prompt a general election.
Shadow Welsh Secretary and Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens added: ""This is an absolute mess and enough is enough. 
""They should put the national interest first and call an election. It's about what's best for the country not Conservative Party survival. We've got to stop this nonsense.""
However, Mr Davies responded: ""Mark Drakeford, Nicola Sturgeon and the last Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, all came into office halfway through a term with a mandate from their parties, not the public."""	/news/uk-wales-63341527
politics	Unemployment edges upwards in Scotland	"Unemployment in Scotland increased slightly during the last quarter amid signs of a cooling jobs market, according to official figures.
Between July and September this year, the unemployment rate among those aged 16 years and over was 3.5%, which was 0.3% up on the previous quarter.
Across the UK, the rate was 3.6%, up from 3.5% in the previous three months.
Office for National Statistics data showed more people dropping out of the workforce.
re was a hike in the proportion of people neither looking for work nor working.
Figures also showed wages still lagging well behind the soaring cost of living.
Regular pay rose by 5.7% in the year to September, the fastest growth since 2000 excluding the pandemic, when people got big rises returning to work from furlough.
However, when adjusted for rising prices, wages fell by 2.7%.
In Scotland, the employment rate for those aged 16 to 64 years was 75.3% between July and September - 0.1% down on the previous quarter.
Meanwhile, the Scottish government said the employment rate for women in Scotland aged 16-64 was the highest since 1992, at 75.2%.
Prof Stuart McIntyre, from the Fraser of Allander economic institute, said it was clear that that the Scottish economy was ""heading into an exceptionally challenging period"".
He said: ""One rising issue of concern in the Scottish labour market is the growing rate of economic inactivity amongst men, now at 21.1%, its highest rate since the current data series began in 1992. 
""There are a number of reasons, both good and bad, for economic inactivity but a particularly worrying one at the moment is the rise in those who are economically inactive because of illness."" 
Scotland's employment minister Richard Lochhead said: ""The Scottish labour market continues to show resilience in the face of ongoing challenges to the economy with marginal changes over the quarter to the employment, unemployment and inactivity rates. 
""The ongoing cost of living crisis, along with the damaging effects of the UK government's recent mini-budget and the continuing adverse consequences of the UK government's Brexit policies, are impacting on Scotland's businesses and workforce.""
UK government's Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the figures showed that Scotland's labour market ""remains strong"".
He added: ""While the figures are encouraging, we appreciate the pressures on many families as we continue to face significant global economic challenges. 
""That's why we have put in place measures to help - including through our energy support scheme and a £1,200 package of support for the most vulnerable."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-63626296

Mr Skidmore, 41, said ""there has been no greater honour in my life"" than representing the constituency in Parliament for the past 12 years. 
When boundaries change, the Kingswood constituency will cease to exist. 
MP said in a statement at the weekend he did not wish to stand elsewhere. 
Mr Skidmore was born and grew up in Kingswood, which sits on the eastern edge of Bristol.
""I do not wish to fight another constituency elsewhere in the region or the country, especially with a very young family who deserve to see more of their father in their lives,"" he said.
""I would like to thank local constituents for putting their trust and faith in me to serve as their local MP.""
Mr Skidmore signed the UK's net zero by 2050 commitment into law in 2019 while serving as Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation in Theresa May's government. 
For the past three months he has been leading a review of the government's delivery of its net zero targets. 
MP said that outside of Parliament, he hoped to continue to focus on tackling global warming.
""It is clear to me that net zero and tackling climate change will be the greatest challenge, yet also the greatest opportunity, of our generation,"" he said.
""It is this opportunity - to demonstrate how we must protect our environment and climate for the future, at the same time as delivering a new clean and sustainable energy system that shifts us away from fossil fuels - that I now wish to devote my attention to."" 
He added: ""Rather than step aside, I hope that in the future I can step up to continue to play my own small part in helping to deliver on the energy transition that the world needs.""
Mr Skidmore's announcement follows that of Dehenna Davison, the Conservative MP for Bishop Auckland.
29-year-old was elected as the County Durham constituency's first Tory MP in 2019.
Elsewhere, senior Conservative MP William Wragg, vice-chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, has said he will not run again.   
Conservatives Chloe Smith, MP for Norwich North, and Gary Streeter, MP for South West Devon, also announced last week they intended to stand down.

sports	Winter Olympics: Finnish skier Remi Lindholm suffers frozen penis in men's 50km cross-country	"Perhaps the worst part of it all for Finland's Remi Lindholm is that it was not even the first time it had happened.
Such was the chance of athletes suffering frostbite, freezing conditions at the Winter Olympics in Beijing had already seen the blue riband men's 50km cross-country ski delayed by an hour - and shortened to a 30km event.
But even those alterations could not save Lindholm from an ""unbearable"" fate.
mmediate concern for the 24-year-old, in the aftermath of completing the final event of his debut Olympic Games, was thawing out his frozen penis.
A heat pack eventually helped the Finn salvage the situation at the end of what was a gruelling race.
However, having spent almost one hour and 16 minutes out on the course in howling winds and appendage-threatening temperatures of -17C, he was, understandably, left in a tremendous amount of pain.
""You can guess which body part was a little bit frozen when I finished,"" Lindholm told Finnish media.
""It was one of the worst competitions I've been in. It was just about battling through.
""When the body parts started to warm up after the finish, the pain was unbearable.""
Poor Lindholm previously suffered a similar incident at a competition in Finland last year, with the thin suits and under layers worn by racers offering minimal protection from extreme cold."	/sport/winter-olympics/60466907

politics	New UK prime minister: What comes next for Rishi Sunak?	"Rishi Sunak will establish a series of firsts when he becomes prime minister - including becoming the first British Asian person to hold the office, and being the first prime minister appointed by King Charles III. But much of the process of the next few days will follow choreography set by decades of tradition.
So what happens now and what can he expect when he does formally become prime minister? 
Liz Truss will hold her final Cabinet meeting at 09:00 BST on Tuesday. As Rishi Sunak is not currently in the Cabinet, he will not be present.
Like many a departing prime minister, she will then deliver a final speech outside 10 Downing Street at about 10:15. 
Ms Truss will then be driven to Buckingham Palace to offer her resignation to the King.
means Ms Truss will miss out on her chance of a goodbye in the House of Commons, as she announced her departure after last week's Prime Minister's Questions, but is being replaced before this week's takes place at noon on Wednesday.
In the past that has provided an opportunity for a standing ovation or a tearful farewell from supporters. Last month it gave Boris Johnson the chance to tell the Commons ""Hasta la vista, baby"". 
Once Ms Truss has departed the scene - and the UK is temporarily without a prime minister - Mr Sunak, as leader of the largest party in the Commons, will be invited to Buckingham Palace by the King. 
King will ask Mr Sunak if he believes he can form a new government, before the politician is  appointed through a tradition called ""kissing hands"". 
In his autobiography, Tony Blair - who was operating on only one hour's sleep following his election victory - admitted to being a bit confused when a royal official told him: ""You don't actually kiss the Queen's hands in the ceremony of kissing hands. You brush them gently with your lips.""
Having been formally appointed as prime minister, the new leader will head to 10 Downing Street - his new workplace and (usually) his new home - although in the past, Tony Blair swapped with the living quarters above No 11 to accommodate his family more comfortably.
Here, at about 11:35, Mr Sunak will make his first prime ministerial speech with the aim of explaining what he wants to do in government.
Margaret Thatcher promised to bring ""harmony... where there is discord"", Gordon Brown vowed to ""try his utmost"", Theresa May spoke of tackling ""burning injustices"" in society, while Boris Johnson warned that ""the doubters, the doomsters, the gloomsters"" would ""lose their shirts"".
re for the speech to be outside No 10 - but becoming prime minister in October means there is a persistent risk of rain, so Mr Sunak's team might be anxiously checking the weather.
w prime minister will then enter through the famous black door to be greeted by Downing Street staff, who traditionally line up to applaud their new boss. Usually it is all smiles, but not always.
When he arrived, Mr Blair noticed one of the secretaries was in tears. Lord Robin Butler - the most senior civil servant at the time - recalls that Mr Blair asked if she was OK. ""Well, Mr Blair, you are welcome,"" she replied ""but I did so like that nice Mr Major [Mr Blair's predecessor].""
re is not much time for anxious introspection as a prime minister must immediately begin appointing senior ministers, some of whom can prove to be surprisingly elusive, just at the moment the party leader wants to sound them out about accepting a promotion.
Dealing with angry or even eager colleagues is to be expected for a prime minister on their first day. Mr Sunak has yet to set out how he plans to bring together a party riven into factions that have driven out two prime ministers in three months. 
Civil servants -  government workers who are not politically appointed so do not change with a new prime minister - will have been monitoring the candidates' various policy pronouncements throughout the leadership campaign and preparing advice.
Mr Sunak has not publicly updated his policy platform since the summer, when he last ran for leader. Since then the economic picture has changed. 
Government borrowing costs have increased following weeks of market turmoil set off by Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget. 
On his first day in the job, Mr Sunak will be presented with briefs from civil servants setting out how his policy plans can be put into action. 
""It is a very big pile of paper,"" says Lord Robin Butler, who led the civil service under Ms Thatcher, John Major and Mr Blair.
""You want them [the new prime minister] to feel that everything has been thought of.""
At some point during his first few days, the prime minister will have to do something that will put everything else into perspective.
He will sit down and write letters to the four commanders of the UK Trident submarines with instructions about whether he should retaliate in the event the UK suffers a nuclear attack. The letters are stored in a safe on board the submarines, and only opened if contact with the UK is lost. 
James Callaghan - prime minister from 1976-1979 - is the only former leader to reveal what he would have done in the event of a nuclear attack.
""If we had got to that point where it was, I felt, necessary to do it - then I would have done it,"" he told a BBC documentary in 1988. ""I've had terrible doubts of course about this. And I say to you that if I had lived after having pressed that button, I would never, never have forgiven myself.""
In 2013, political historian Lord Peter Hennessy told BBC Radio Four: ""This is the moment they know what being prime minister is all about - no other job can prepare you for this."" 
first days of the prime minister's term are normally filled with phone calls from foreign dignitaries.
President Biden is looking forward to speaking with Mr Sunak in the coming days, the White House Press Secretary said. But they added that it was ""protocol for the president to wait until after an incoming British prime minister has met with the monarch and been invited to form a new government to offer his congratulations"".
gratulations have already started rolling in, though. 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted ""Special Diwali wishes"" to Mr Sunak and ""the 'living bridge' of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership""."	/news/uk-politics-62596329
health	China Xinjiang: Urumqi rocked by Covid lockdown protests after deadly fire	"Watch: Protests erupt after deadly China residential fire
Videos shared on social media in China have appeared to show fresh protests against Covid restrictions, after an apartment block fire killed 10 people.
People in Urumqi are seen confronting officials, breaking down a barrier and shouting ""end the Covid lockdown"".
Infections have hit new highs in China in spite of a tough zero-Covid policy. 
Authorities in Urumqi have now promised to phase out restrictions - though deny that these stopped people escaping Thursday's fire.
Restrictions have been in place in the city - capital of the western Xinjiang region - since early August.  
BBC was told by one resident in the aftermath of the incident that people living in the fire-hit compound had been largely prevented from leaving their homes.

Footage shared on Friday night showed residents, many of them in face masks, gathering after dark on the city streets.
were seen chanting, pumping their firsts and arguing with officials. The location was verified by the Reuters news agency.
One demonstrator shouts through a megaphone, and in another clip, a crowd breaks through a barrier policed by city workers wearing protective gear. 
Live streams monitored by the BBC on Friday night also appeared to show protesters gathered on the steps of a city government building. 
rnet is heavily censored in China, and references to the Urumqi protests had largely been taken down by Saturday morning. 
Local media said Thursday's deadly blaze at the Urumqi apartment block - which also injured nine people - appeared to have been caused by a fault with an electrical extension. 
Online posts have suggested that firefighting efforts were hindered by Covid restrictions.

Large-scale, disruptive protests are rare in China, although there has been mounting public dissent aimed at Beijing's zero-Covid strategy. 
Other protests were also been reported in cities such as Xi'an, Chongqing and Nanjing on Saturday. Many of them were reported at universities. 
monstrations have gained a lot of support on social media site Weibo, where those taking part have been referred to as ""brave"". 
Others on Weibo have shared their frustration at the incident in Urumqi and the government's zero covid stance. 
""The unlimited trust we gave the government at the beginning did not change their conscience. The life, safety and basic demands of the people are deaf to them,"" one person wrote. 
zero-Covid strategy is the last policy of its kind among the world's major economies, and is partly due to China's relatively low vaccination levels and an effort to protect elderly people.
Snap lockdowns have caused anger across the country - and Covid restrictions more broadly have trigged recent violent protests from Zhengzhou to Guangzhou. 
In spite of the stringent measures, China's case numbers this week hit all-time records since the pandemic began.

health	Cornwall to trial at home health checks	"A landmark trial aimed at making it easier for patients to carry out health checks has been launched in Cornwall.
Patients will complete online questionnaires, take blood samples at home, and complete blood pressure checks at a pharmacy or GP surgery.
rial is the first of its kind and comes as part of the government's plan to digitalise the NHS Health Check.
Public health minister Neil O'Brien said the checks would ""reduce pressure"" on services.
NHS Health Check is a health check-up for adults in England aged 40 to 74 designed to prevent stroke, kidney disease, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some types of dementia.
A total of 15 million people are eligible for free NHS Health Checks in England, according to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).
ks are currently delivered face-to-face by GPs, but many parts of the check can be done without a GP.
w trial aims to free up time for more urgent GP appointments, the DHSC said.
More than 2,000 people from three GP surgeries across Cornwall are being invited to take part in the trial - only those whose results indicate an underlying health condition will be followed-up by their GP.
results of the trial will help inform the design and development of the new national NHS Digital Health Check.
Minister for public health Neil O'Brien said: ""Innovation is key to a modern, forward looking National Health Service, and this trial will help us understand what a new digital NHS Health Check could look like in the years to come.
""During the pandemic people got used to doing tests at home and getting their results online, so this trial is an opportunity for us to apply some of the lessons we learnt during Covid and improve the way we deliver healthcare.""
Dr Andy Sant, managing director of NHS Cornwall's north and east integrated care area said he was ""delighted"" patients in Cornwall were being given the first opportunity to access the digital health checks.
According to the DHSC, the offer of NHS Health Checks has been historically lower in Cornwall than most local authorities in England.
During 2019-20, over 13,400 checks were offered and over 6,900 were completed, but in 2021-22 approximately 4,300 were offered and just over 1,900 were completed.
Cornwall councillor Dr Andy Virr, portfolio holder for adults and public health, said it was ""great news"" the trial was being carried out in the area.

business	Government borrowing lower than expected in April	"Government borrowing was lower than expected in April, although the figure was still the fourth-highest total for the month since records began.
Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was £18.6bn, down £5.6bn from April last year.
Office for National Statistics also cut its estimate for borrowing in the previous financial year.
One analyst said the figures would put pressure on the chancellor to ""go big"" on a support package for households.  
With the cost of living rising at its fastest pace for 40 years, there have been calls for the government to provide extra help.
Opposition parties have called for a windfall tax on energy firms, and while the government has resisted such a measure so far, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said ""no option is off the table"" to tackle rising living costs.
ONS cut its estimate for borrowing during the previous financial year by £7.2bn to £144.6bn, although this was still the third-highest financial year borrowing total since records began in 1947.
""The lower-than-expected public borrowing of £18.6bn in April and the downward revisions to borrowing in 2021-22 will only add to the pressure on the chancellor to go big when finalising the imminent support package for households,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
However, he added: ""We think any support will be small and targeted rather than big and widespread.""
Borrowing surged during the pandemic as the government spent billions to support the economy. However, borrowing has fallen back as the economy has recovered and as the government ended measures such as the furlough scheme.
April's borrowing total was lower than expected, with the government's independent forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility - having predicted £19.1bn.
month saw the first contributions to government revenues of the increase to National Insurance. But spending during April also included the £3bn cost of the council tax rebate, under which many households will receive £150 to help with higher energy bills.
Interest payments on government borrowing were £4.4bn, which was lower than expected. However, analysts expect this figure to surge in the months ahead, as interest paid on government bonds rises with increases in the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation.
""Following the latest spike in RPI inflation, we now expect monthly interest spending to reach an eye-watering £16bn in June,"" said Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK.
Chancellor Rishi Sunak, said: ""While we are doing what we can to help families deal with rising prices, inflation is also pushing up our spending on debt interest - which is expected to reach £83bn this year.
""We must take a balanced and responsible approach to support people now, while also not burdening future generations, and we're on track to drive public debt down by 2024-25.""
Government debt - the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years - stood at £2.35 trillion in April. 
figure almost exceeds the size of the UK economy, with debt having reached 95.7% of gross domestic product (GDP). 
A separate survey of companies indicated that growth in the UK's private sector has slowed to its weakest in 15 months.
monthly purchasing managers' index - which surveys senior managers at companies who take buying and hiring decisions - fell sharply in May to 51.8 from 58.2 in April, although a figure above 50 still implies activity is growing.
Manufacturers reported the steepest drop in export orders since June 2020. A number of goods producers cited Brexit-related trade frictions as the main factor contributing to lower export sales in May, especially in relation to new customs rules, extra documentation requirements and other complexities with EU trade.

business	More flights cancelled ahead of Jubilee break	"Holiday giant Tui is cancelling more flights as air passengers face ongoing disruption ahead of the Jubilee bank holiday weekend. 
ui will cancel six flights a day until the end of June, affecting around 34,000 travellers in all.
Other airlines have also cancelled flights, as around two million people prepare to fly over the next few days.
One family, whose flight was cancelled with less than two days notice, said their children were ""devastated"".
Joanna Chandramani said she, her husband and their seven-year-old twin girls had been set to fly to Turkey on Wednesday, but she got a text on Monday evening telling her their holiday was cancelled.
She said Tui had now offered them vouchers but the family did not want to re-book with them so were flying with Jet2 to Mallorca instead. 
""We have lost all faith in Tui,"" she added.
ui said customers affected by cancellations would receive a full refund for their holidays ""as well as an extra gesture of goodwill"".
mpany said the cancellations represented about 4% of its flights.
ui said it understood the cancellations would be ""disappointing"" but added: ""We believe this is necessary to provide stability and a better customer service at Manchester Airport.""
usands of passengers across the UK have had their flights cancelled or faced delays at airports when checking in and collecting baggage as the half-term break began.
Before the Covid pandemic, airports and airlines across Great Britain employed around 140,000 people, according to Airlines UK. However, since then thousands of jobs have been cut, including around 30,000 for UK airlines alone, due to the restrictions on international travel. 
ustry has struggled to cope with a surge in flyers as demand picked up again, with many finding it difficult to recruit and train new staff quick enough.
Prospect, the union which represents staff across air traffic control and in aviation engineering, warned that things could ""get worse before they get better"". 
Airport Operators Association, which represents the industry, said big recruitment campaigns had been under way since before the start of this year and additional staff were now being deployed. 
It said most passengers were getting through security smoothly and the association would continue to work with the government to be ready for the summer. 
Have you been affected by travel issues? 
Around 10,000 flights are set to leave the UK between Thursday and Sunday, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium.
Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government was working with the travel industry to tackle the problems.
""We put in place billions of pounds of support for the travel industry, in particular during the pandemic,"" he said.
""Right now there are conversations happening between the industry and ministers to make sure disruption can be eased.""
But Garry Graham, deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, said: ""The government point to the furlough scheme but ignore that it ended well before the majority of international restrictions on travel came to an end.""
rade unions say airlines are struggling to recruit staff because jobs in the industry are not well-paid or secure enough and training new staff takes time. As a result the problems are likely to continue for some time.
Michael Turner, a nurse from Shoreham, is currently on his third attempt to go on holiday with his family to Tenerife. 
Due to fly from Gatwick last Thursday, Mr Turner was told his EasyJet flight had been cancelled 20 minutes before departure. He re-booked a Tui flight which was all that was available and said he experienced ""absolute chaos"" in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport.  
After boarding the plane, Mr Turner said its pilot called the police as no-one was able to get off for three hours. 
family was then escorted to collect their baggage and put on a coach without being told where they were going and are now waiting to be taken back to the airport for a flight this evening.
Manchester Airport said Tui and Swissport, which provides ground services such as baggage handling, ""are experiencing temporary staff shortages, in common with other aviation and travel companies"".
A spokesperson for Swissport apologised for its part in any disruption, adding that the return of demand for flights was ""exacerbating resource challenges across the aviation industry."". 
A number of other airports reported high traffic on Tuesday. 
Glasgow Airport said queues at security were ""longer than usual"" in the morning, though passengers moved through at a ""steady pace"".
A spokesperson said the airport was ""busier than it has been for more than two years"" but urged people not to arrive early. 
At Edinburgh Airport some passengers had to wait outside the terminal building to check in luggage. 
Meanwhile, Stansted is forecasting 80,000 passengers a day over the next week.
re were also long waits for Eurostar train services at London's St Pancras station, with queues extending outside the building.
Eurostar said one train was taken out of service earlier due to a technical fault, leading to delays of 30 to 60 minutes. 
A spokeswoman said queues were moving and staff were working hard to ensure check-in was as smooth as possible.

rteen bills have either already been in parliament this month or are currently scheduled to return before December.
But it's been reported Prime Minister Mr Sunak plans to deprioritise at least some of those, such as the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill.
And one controversial bill announced after Queen's Speech, the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill, is likely to get held up by objections in the Lords.
would override elements of the Brexit withdrawal agreement with the European Union.
wo bills in the Queen's Speech - Social Security (Special Rules for End of Life) and Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) - have completed all their parliamentary stages.
Not introduced: 8
Less than halfway through Parliament: 15
More than halfway through Parliament: 8
Finished all parliamentary stages: 2
more recent Energy Prices Act, which provides the legal basis for the government's latest energy bills support measures, was emergency legislation - meaning it was fast-tracked through Parliament and became law only two weeks after being introduced.
""There are quite a few bills that are obviously making very slow progress,"" says Alice Lilly, senior researcher at the Institute for Government (IFG) think tank. 
riod of national mourning following the Queen's death reduced the parliamentary time available, says Ms Lilly, but she adds: ""We're definitely now getting to the stage where if the government introduce a brand new piece of legislation, if it was big and controversial they'd struggle to get it though by end of the session.
""There's all these other bills that are going through and languishing. Trying to get that through, when you also factor in Christmas and Easter recesses, that becomes difficult.""
upheaval has also caused ""changes in whips, Commons leader, people in Number 10 who were doing legislative affairs - each time new people come into roles they need to sit down, say what do we want to do with this, try to figure out priorities - that all takes time"". 
One former senior minister told the BBC they did not think the number of bills in their early stages was unusual and that there was enough time left for them to pass this parliament.
But there are question marks over the final shape of some high-profile pieces of legislation.
One flagship bill reportedly being watered down is the Online Safety Bill. It's designed to improve protections for internet users, especially children. 
- first mooted under then-Prime Minister Theresa May and part of Boris Johnson's 2019 general election manifesto - will see its measures on ""harmful but legal"" content dropped, according to some media reports.
It has not progressed since July, and was paused under then-Prime Minister Ms Truss over free speech worries. Mr Sunak indicated at Prime Minister's Questions this week the bill will return in ""due course"".
""It was very closely associated with [then-Culture Secretary] Nadine Dorries. Now she's not in post it's up in the air,"" says Ms Lilly. 
""There's quite a lot of disagreement among Tory MPs on the content of the bill.""
main provision of the Media Bill - another of Ms Dorries' bills - on privatising Channel 4, is widely expected to be dropped.
would also require media platforms to make content from public service broadcasters - such as the BBC and ITV - more prominent.
Ms Dorries tweeted last month there was ""widespread dismay"" about the bills being put on hold, and that they'd been ""signed off by cabinet all ready to go"".
First announced by Mrs May's government, this would scrap no-fault evictions and protect tenants from unscrupulous landlords.
It is taking a very long time to become law, having been mentioned in three different Queen's Speeches.
Housing campaigners had feared it was likely to be dropped under Ms Truss, but with Michael Gove, a supporter of the measures, back in government, they are hoping it will finally make it across the line.
Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, says ""private renting is completely broken - anything less than wholesale reform won't give renters the security and stability they need"". 
""The government has promised major changes […] The Renters' Reform Bill is ready to go, so it's time for the government to stop stalling and make it law,"" she adds. 
Bill of Rights would limit the powers of the European Court of Human Rights in the UK.
It was championed by Dominic Raab - justice secretary under Mr Johnson, who has returned to the same job under Mr Sunak.
Ms Lilly, of the IFG, says the bill is one example of where ""the political fortunes of individuals is having an impact"". 
""It's very much Dominic Raab's bill and had its first reading before the summer recess but a date isn't even scheduled for its second reading.""
It was reported Liz Truss halted the plans.
But Mr Raab tweeted that it will now ""return to Parliament in the coming weeks"".
Ministers almost dropped plans to ban the practice of trying to change the sexuality of someone who is gay or bisexual entirely earlier this year. 
Hours later they changed their minds and brought the plans back, but without measures outlawing conversion therapy for transgender people.
It's been reported new Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch asked to review the plans - although the government has denied that any policy decisions have been made.
was in the Conservatives' 2019 election manifesto.
Sophie Corlett, from mental health charity Mind, says the ""government cannot keep delaying and watering down a ban that is essential to protecting millions of LGBTQIA+ people across Britain from unethical and inhumane treatment"". 
""Every day this ban is delayed, more people will be harmed by conversion 'therapy'. The government must bring forward the bill as a priority"".
gislation has already been pushed until at least next May.
It would enable the creation of Great British Railways, a state-owned agency to replace the ""fragmented"" privatised rail system, setting timetables, prices, selling tickets and managing rail infrastructure.
-Transport Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan told a Commons committee the bill had been pushed to the next session.
She said a narrower bill containing some measures could be introduced sooner.
ransportXtra news website reported that the policy position remains in place for now under new Transport Secretary Mark Harper."	/news/uk-politics-63600696
entertainment	'Homage' to Cromer Pier premiers at Cambridge Film Festival	"A German documentary maker's trip to a English seaside variety show has inspired him to make a film about it.
Seaside Special is a film about one of Britain's remaining end-of-the-pier variety shows in Cromer, Norfolk.
Its director, Jens Meurer, said the film was an ""homage"" to the show he had ""fallen in love"" with 10 years ago when his in-laws took him to see it.
umentary has premiered at the Cambridge Film Festival.
Mr Meurer said the show was ""not about becoming super-famous"", but it was about ""entertaining the 500 people who were in that amazing Victorian theatre twice a day"".
""My desire to capture this world on camera finally fell into place in 2019 - the year when Brexit came to a head and just before the pandemic struck,"" he said.
He said he wanted to film the ""most British place I know"" and the ""kind of British-ness we miss"".
wins Polly and Sophie Duniam, who danced in the show as children and feature in the new documentary, said their mum's dance school in Cromer has supplied many participants to the variety shows.
were initially unsure about Mr Meurer wanting to make the film.
""Then we met Jens ... he's got a real heart for this place,"" Polly said.
G is a vocal impressionist who performed in the documentary and has lived in Norfolk since 2001.
He said it was ""mind-blowing"" the film would get a screening in the director's home country in January.
""The idea it's going to be shown in Germany and people will see this snippet of British life, particularly Cromer and the show, is daunting, but I feel so proud to have been a part of that,"" he said.
film will also be at the Norwich Film Festival on 12 November.

sports	Saudi Arabia set to host first F1 race of 2024 season	"Saudi Arabia looks set to host the opening race of the 2024 Formula 1 season, in a change from previous plans for it to be held in Australia.
ws emerged in a statement from the Victorian state government announcing a two-year contract extension for the Australian Grand Prix until 2037.
ment said Melbourne's Albert Park track would host the opening race at least four times during the contract term, but Saudi Arabia would do so in 2024 ""out of respect for Ramadan"".
Bahrain, which borders Saudi Arabia, has become the default opening race of the season since the pandemic disrupted the shape of the calendar in 2020. It held its race on 20 March this year.
But Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, is due to start on 11 March in 2024, as opposed to 2 April this year.
As a result, F1 had been planning to move the start of the season back to Melbourne, which had been the usual opening event pre-Covid. 
F1 was unable to confirm that Saudi Arabia would start the 2024 season. 
It said in a statement: ""Formula 1 has not released any details of future calendars. The 2024 calendar will be confirmed in the usual way later in the year.""
However, BBC Sport has been told that, while F1 chairman Stefano Domenicali is still working through plans for the first part of the 2024 season, the Saudi event on the Jeddah street circuit is on course to be the opening race.
No explanation for the change from the original plan to hold it in Australia has been provided.
Nor is it clear why, if it is possible to hold a grand prix in the Middle East to start the season before Ramadan in 2024, it would be in Saudi Arabia and not Bahrain.
re will be speculation that Saudi Arabia - which already pays one of the largest hosting fees for its event - has paid an additional fee to secure the prestige of hosting the first race. But a source close to the situation insisted that was not the case.
Earlier this year Saudi Arabia rejected F1's proposal to host a 'sprint' event in 2023 because organisers baulked at the extra money involved."	/sport/formula1/63984481
politics	COP27: Rishi Sunak urges world to move faster on renewable energy	"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is set to urge world leaders at COP27 to move ""further and faster"" in transitioning to renewable energy. 
Mr Sunak will travel to Egypt on Sunday for the UN climate summit after U-turning on a decision not to go. 
In his address on Monday, he will say Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""reinforced"" the importance of ending dependence on fossil fuels. 
COP27 follows a year of climate-related disasters and record temperatures. 
rime minister will also tell leaders gathered in Sharm el-Sheikh not to ""backslide"" on commitments made at last year's COP26 summit in Glasgow intended to prevent global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.
But Petteri Taalas, secretary general of the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), has warned that the 1.5C target is ""barely within reach"". 
His comment comes as the UN's weather and climate body released a report showing that the rate at which sea levels are rising has doubled since 1993. 
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has described the report as a ""chronicle of climate chaos"" and urged governments at COP27 to answer the planet's ""distress signal"" with ""ambitious, credible climate action"".
Mr Sunak will meet French President Emmanuel Macron at the summit this week and the topic of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats will likely be raised. 
In a statement before his departure, Mr Sunak said: ""When the world came together in Glasgow last year, nations agreed an historic roadmap for preventing catastrophic global warming. It is more important than ever that we deliver on those pledges.
""Fighting climate change is not just a moral good - it is fundamental to our future prosperity and security.
""Russia's invasion of Ukraine and contemptible manipulation of energy prices has only reinforced the importance of ending our dependence on fossil fuels.
""We need to move further and faster to transition to renewable energy, and I will ensure the UK is at the forefront of this global movement as a clean energy superpower.""
It comes after the prime minister backtracked on attending the summit earlier this week. 
Mr Sunak had originally stated he would not travel to Egypt, arguing that his priority was to plug a £50bn hole in the public finances ahead of Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's autumn statement on 17 November. 
Labour's Ed Miliband said the prime minister ""dithered"" about attending the climate summit, adding that: ""Britain needs to be in the climate leadership business.""
Speaking on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the shadow climate change secretary said it was now ""cheaper to save the planet than to destroy it"". 
""We're in the midst of an energy crisis,"" he said, adding that renewable energy sources were now much cheaper than fossil fuels.
Mr Miliband insisted that switching to renewables was ""the opportunity of the future"" and that this was the ""message we should be taking to COP"".
Mr Sunak's initial decision not to attend the summit was widely criticised by climate campaigners, opposition parties and COP26 President and colleague Alok Sharma.   
Cabinet minister Oliver Dowden has defended the prime minister, saying he was ""committed"" to environmental issues. 
Mr Dowden told Laura Kuenssberg that, when Mr Sunak came to power, his first priority was the economic crisis but that he had worked on the Autumn Statement ""to make sure he can go to this summit"". 
Mr Dowden was also questioned about host country Egypt's human rights record, including its detention of British Egyptian national Alaa Abd El-Fattah, an activist who has been in jail for nine years and is on a hunger strike.
Asked if the prime minister would raise Abdel Fattah's case while at the summit, the cabinet minister said: ""I'm sure he will raise it at appropriate forums"". 
Labour's Mr Miliband said it was a ""very serous issue"" and that he would ""make sure to raise it with the Egyptians while I'm there"". 
rime minister has sent a letter to Abdel Fattah's family pledging that the activist's case is ""a priority for the British government both as a human rights defender and as a British national"". 
However, speaking on Sky News, Abdel Fattah's sister Sanaa Seif said she was concerned No 10's engagement with the Egyptian president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi would come too late. 
Speaking of her worry that her brother could die while the climate summit was happening, she urged the British government to be ""responsible for getting us proof of life"". 
government has faced criticism for approving new oil and gas licences in the North Sea despite the International Energy Agency saying there can be no more new fossil fuel exploration if the 1.5C target is to be met.
Mr Sunak is expected to chair a meeting of world leaders to drive progress on the pledge signed by 100 countries at Glasgow to halt and reverse deforestation and damaging land use by 2030. 
r of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, said he did not think the climate summit this week would be a success. 
""I don't think there's been the leadership either from our country or frankly from other countries,"" he told Laura Kuenssberg.
Meanwhile the King, who made an address at COP26 last year and is known for his passionate interest in environmental issues, will not be attending the summit after Buckingham Palace agreed with former Prime Minister Liz Truss he would not attend. 
Although Downing Street suggested this week they may have come to a different view if Mr Sunak had been installed in No 10 earlier. 
round of UN climate talks takes place amid a backdrop of increasingly devastating extreme weather around the globe, and an energy and cost-of-living crisis driven by President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. 
COP27 agenda will highlight calls to reduce emissions, help countries deal with climate change, and secure technical support and funding for developing countries. 
UN has also warned that based on countries' latest climate action plans, there is currently no credible pathway to meet the 1.5C goal intended to avoid the worst impacts of global warming.
Rich countries are further falling short in providing finance to help developing nations adapt to climate change, according to the UN.

business	Energy bill help to be reduced from April, says Jeremy Hunt	"A scheme to cap all household energy bills for two years will be cut from April, the new chancellor has said. 
Jeremy Hunt said the support - which limits a typical household bill to £2,500 - would be reviewed so it cost ""significantly less than planned"". 
He said the most vulnerable would continue to be protected from soaring wholesale energy prices.
move sparked concern among consumer groups who warned households would be plunged into uncertainty. 
""Everyone knows why decisions have been made at breakneck speed, but there are questions that need to be answered, and answered quickly,"" said National Energy Action boss Adam Scorer.
""Who will still get support? Will it include vulnerable households not on welfare benefits? Will that support be deeper for those in greatest need?""
Mr Hunt is trying to save money after the government's mini-budget left a big projected hole in the public finances. Its plan for large tax cuts sparked turmoil on financial markets over how the plans would be funded.
""Beyond [April], the Prime Minister and I have agreed it would not be responsible to continue exposing public finances to unlimited volatility in international gas prices,"" the chancellor said. 
""The objective is to design a new approach that will cost the taxpayer significantly less than planned whilst ensuring enough support for those in need,"" he said.
Under the Energy Price Guarantee, announced last month, Ms Truss's government capped all household energy bills for two years from 1 October in a bid to prevent millions facing hardship this winter.
Now that will only be in place for six months, just to cover this winter. The Treasury will review support given from April, but Mr Hunt said there would be ""a new approach"" targeting those in the most need.
Before this guarantee was introduced, the energy price cap - the highest amount suppliers are allowed to charge households for every unit of energy they use - had been due to rise to £3,549 for a typical household from October.
Predictions from consultants Cornwall Insight suggest that, for households that do not receive any support, a typical annual energy bill could be £4,347 in the spring, dropping to £3,722 next winter - however that prediction could be significantly affected by changing wholesale prices.
How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch.
Consumer rights campaigner Martin Lewis said that while the support for intervention had been desperately needed, a ""universal energy price guarantee was always expensive and poorly targeted"". 
But he added: ""The post-April support will still need to reach a decent way up the net and support middle earners, energy rates are still huge.""
Ms Truss's plan - thought to cost up to £150bn - was to be funded through government borrowing after the prime minister rejected calls to extend a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. 
However, former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng followed it with plans to cut taxes by some £45bn.
Concerns about rising borrowing sparked turmoil on financial markets which spilled over into the mortgage market, where interest rates on loans have surged to 14-year highs. 
On Monday, Mr Hunt promised to review the energy support while also reversing £32bn worth of the planned tax cuts. The new chancellor said he was doing ""what is necessary for economic stability"".
He added that the Energy Price Guarantee had been ""the biggest single expense"" of Mr Kwarteng's growth plan. 
When it was announced, many had criticised the scheme for not being targeted enough, arguing the support should have been means tested. 
Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, which had described the package as ""clearly not sustainable in the long-term"", welcomed Mr Hunt's decision.
""While large-scale untargeted support for households this winter was perhaps unavoidable we need to do everything possible to put in place a better designed, better targeted and less expensive scheme next year,"" said IFS director Paul Johnson.
But the Centre for Ageing Better, a charity, said many older people faced an anxious wait to find out how much help they would get. 
Boss Carole Easton said: ""The previous two-year promise provided a level of security for people in uncertain times.  
""It is vital that the government gives plenty of advance notice with clear messaging as to who will be eligible for targeted support in April.""
Under Ms Truss's scheme, businesses are protected for six months from soaring energy prices, with those struggling most set to continue receiving help pending a review. 
Mr Hunt suggested the targeted approach would continue, but the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) called for clarity. 
""The review to come on business and consumer energy support after six months must avoid a cliff-edge for small firms that remain impacted and vulnerable,"" said the FSB's national chair, Martin McTague. "	/news/business-63283436
politics	Germany coup plot: The extremists who tried to topple the state	"A dusting of snow covered the floor of the naked winter forest all around. 
ree alpaca stared bleakly at us as we rounded what seemed like the umpteenth sharp bend along the rural roads of the east German region of east Thuringia. 
Looming behind the animals, perched on a hill, we finally saw what we'd travelled all this way for: the stone turreted towers of the neo-Gothic hunting lodge, Schloss Waidmannsheil. 
HQ, to a large extent, until this Wednesday, for an eclectic group of plotters, hoping to take over the German parliament and destroy the structures of modern Germany, replacing them with a monarchical system, with a Prince at its head, whose family used to rule this region for hundreds of years before World War One. 
And all this to be done and dusted by Christmas.
Sound incredible, almost unbelievable?
It does. And the said prince is now spending the festive season behind bars, in police custody. 
But German security services were sufficiently concerned about the attempted coup to launch one of their biggest ever raids, nationwide and beyond (in Austria and Italy), involving 3,000 officers, searching 150 properties and arresting 25 people in total. 
Intelligence officers told us to expect more detentions in the coming weeks and months as the investigation continues. And German media is buzzing with talk of increased security in and around the country's federal and regional parliaments. 
In stark contrast to this week's screamingly sensational headlines, the hunting lodge grounds seemed deserted, even ghostly, as I peered through the padlocked gates. The skulls of deer, presumably hunted on the grounds here, hung despondently along the exterior wall of a dilapidated outhouse.
Media-wary neighbours grudgingly told me they'd seen lights on in the lodge but hardly noticed people going in or out in recent months. Visitors used a side entrance instead, they said. Accessing the building from a forest back road, behind the local graveyard.
We now know why those frequenting Schloss Waidmannsheil weren't at all keen on being seen. 
'd begun planning a coup back in November 2021 - going as far as to appoint ministers of their eagerly-anticipated new Reich, the new German regime, as well as a military wing to enable their putsch.
""We are appalled,"" the head of the hereditary prince's family, Heinrich XIV, Fürst Reuss, told me via Zoom from his stately home in Austria. ""This outsider was ostracised years ago because of his outlandish conspiracy theories and antisemitic views. He's not representative of our family at all.""
Fürst Reuss told me Heinrich XIII wasn't always ""like this"". All the men in the family are called Heinrich with a number after their name, by the way. There are 30 of them alive today. Number XIII was nicknamed Racing Heinrich in his youth, due to his penchant for fast cars - and beautiful models. 
unting lodge belonged to the family for hundreds of years, before being confiscated by the East German communist government after World War II.
Racing Heinrich grew into a bitter man, his distant relative told me, with a shake of his head. ""He was plagued by misfortune."" 
Heinrich XIII has a severely ill daughter, a not very successful real-estate business he runs out of Frankfurt, and he blames the German authorities for the failure of most of his huge number of court cases - attempts to reclaim aristocratic family properties.
mmunists used the hunting lodge as a youth hostel. The Putsch Prince - as German media have now dubbed him - ended up having to buy it back himself in the early 1990s after the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of the Soviet Union.
""He ended up with the wrong kind of friends,"" Fürst Reuss told me. ""As we now see.""  
f protagonists in Heinrich XIII's planned putsch read like those of a spy thriller or perhaps, the spoof of one. 
racy theories-believing 71-year-old German prince, his far younger Russian girlfriend who tried to get backing for the planned coup from the Kremlin, a gourmet chef, a serving member of the elite German special forces, a former police superintendent, a Berlin judge and former German parliamentarian for the hard right Alternative for Germany party.
Birgit Malsack-Winkemann was designated Justice Minister of the planned new regime. Her insider knowledge of parliament was key in planning the pre-Christmas, armed and assumed to be violent take-over. 
Agents listening in to phone calls heard the plotters talk about deaths that were ""bound to happen"". Malsack-Winkemann allegedly also had a passion for the esoteric and, according to investigators, consulted astrology charts to determine which precise day the putsch should be launched.
But what really made the intelligence community in Germany sit up and take notice was the cast-list of the group's assembled military wing. Rüdiger von P - as investigators refer to him - was the head of the armed wing, tasked with forcing the group's way into parliament, handcuffing MPs and keeping police forces at bay. 
Rüdiger von P is a former lieutenant colonel and commander of an elite parachute regiment, suspected of hoarding and stashing weapons while in active duty according to German media. 
Directly under him was currently-serving elite special forces officer, Andreas M, and former army colonel, Maximillian Eder - who has a prolific presence on social media platform Telegram, and recently sent a video message to friends warning of social upheaval before Christmas. Also in the mix: discharged former chief inspector and open conspiracy-theorist Michel F and survival expert and neo-Nazi linked Peter W. Investigators say he came to their attention back in April when they searched his apartment and found firearms and ammunition.
In the raids this Wednesday, weapons were found in 50 of the properties searched, which included army barracks in southern Germany. One of the police officers at the prince's hunting lodge reportedly told neighbours they were searching for munitions and explosives there.
Just how wide-spread extremist ideology runs in German security forces, no-one is quite sure, which is extremely worrying, according to Nicholas Potter, a senior researcher into far-right racism and antisemitism at the Berlin Amedeu Antonio foundation. 
He told the BBC about a series of recent scandals in the armed forces, including the disbanding of the second company of the KSK - the elite special forces in Germany - because far-right thinking was so prevalent there.
""The fact that we're seeing an alarming amount of ammunition and weapons just disappearing from bases, and landing in the hands of far-right soldiers. I mean, we're seeing the tip of an iceberg here [in this planned coup case] that I suspect really runs much deeper. This is very alarming. It's important to remember you don't need that many highly trained motivated armed soldiers to pose a very serious threat to democracy.""
up-plotters included large numbers of so-called Reichsbürger in their ranks. These so-called Reich citizens are individuals - numbering over 21,000 - who don't recognise the legitimacy of the Federal Republic of modern Germany and therefore refuse to pay taxes, accept rulings by German judges or use German number plates for their cars. Reichsbürger believe the legitimate country of Germany ceased to exist after the imperial Reich collapsed after World War I.
In 2016, when police raided a Reichsbürger home to seize illegally held firearms, the homeowner shot at them, killing one of the officers. Intelligence officials told us Reichsbürger have become increasingly radicalised in recent years, though they think only a small percentage are prepared to resort to violence themselves.
ummer, Prince Reuss, Heinrich XIII, organised for leaflets to be dropped through residents' letterboxes in the spa town of Bad Lobenstein - which his hunting lodge is part of  - informing them that they weren't proper Germans if they held ID cards from the Federal Republic.
""I thought he was a nutter,"" pensioner Isabel told us before she popped into the cashpoint in the quaint and cobbled old town centre. ""His leaflet had a link to a website where we could order a Reichs passport and driving license with the old red, black and white Reichs flag on it instead of the modern German flag. We were also invited to take part in elections to form a local mini kingdom here. Presumably with him at the head of it. I scrunched up the paper and threw it in a bin.""
But not everyone we met in Bad Lobenstein was so dismissive. 
Removal man Sebastian told me he had family members and friends who sympathised with the Prince.
""I'm sad to say this but yes. There are a lot of people who aren't happy with this country as it is now. They are suspicious of the German government and would love a different kind of Germany.""
Disinformation researcher at Berlin's CEMAS - Josef Holnburger - says studies suggest a whopping 20% of Germans are susceptible to conspiracy theories. Including online Russian propaganda.
He told me Germans were particularly vulnerable at this moment: post Covid-19 pandemic, facing an economic downturn, with energy cost concerns linked to the war in Ukraine. Many blame the authorities. 
Stephen Kramer, the regional intelligence chief for Thuringia, the eastern German home of the prince's hunting lodge, pinpoints the Covid-19 pandemic as a turning point - not just in Germany, but across much of Europe. He says extremist groups swoop in in times of crisis, seeking to exploit the situation to their advantage.
""Germany's new right and cultural neo-Nazis would never normally go near the Reichsbürger who have often been viewed as crazy or eccentric. But with so many in this country protesting against Covid-19 lockdowns, they saw an opportunity to join forces,"" he told the BBC.
""They're now co-operating because they have a common goal: to overcome the German Federal Republic. One group claims the federal republic doesn't actually exist [the Reichsbürger], the other [the nationalist hard right] says it exists but wants to replace the republic with a new [authoritarian] regime. They aren't connected ideologically but they are bound by this common goal. They attend demonstrations together where they try to recruit new members.""
It was at one of these demonstrations - of 40,000 people in Berlin at the height of the Covid pandemic - that a breakaway group staged a symbolic attempt to storm parliament. 
was a taster of what was to follow five months later in Washington when supporters of then-US President Donald Trump and conspiracy theorists stormed the Capitol. Donald Trump has referred to the Berlin event, saying he heard the protesters there liked him.
He's right. Many in that Berlin crowd look to former US President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin as strongmen defenders of - in their opinion - a better, whiter, more conservative Christian society.
Germany has the largest following in the world - outside English-speaking countries - of the US-originating, and Trump-celebrating, QAnon conspiracy theories. They focus hatred towards an alleged ""deep state"". At its heart they imagine a corrupt, power-hungry, child-murdering and molesting elite. Their enemy is liberal, global, and often Jewish. 
German QAnon supporters joined forces with vocal anti-vaxxers, neo-Nazis and Reichsbürger at the German parliament building, the Reichstag, that late August 2020. Police stopped protesters on the steps before they could attempt to push their way in, but symbolically it was seen as a successful day for the German anti-establishment. 
Especially as photos of the demonstrators, draped in the black, white and red Reichs flag, were broadcast around the world. That flag is also a neo-Nazi favourite, as all merchandise sporting swastikas are illegal here.
As for improving security in Germany going forward, I was struck while investigating this story how many people we contacted - who could be perceived as ""serving"" the German establishment - receive regular death threats.
Like disinformation expert Josef Holnburger, who asked to speak to us away from his CEMAS offices for security reasons, and intelligence chief Stephen Kramer, who lives with the knowledge that he's a constant target. 
racker of Germany's far-right Nicholas Potter and his colleagues are often threatened with violence, as is Die Linke MP and anti-fascism campaigner Martina Renner. She shared with us her concern at the rise in Germany, not only of membership of radical conspiracy and new hard right movements, but also the increasing number of associated physical attacks. Even murders. 
When we asked former neo-Nazi, turned anti-fascist activist, Ingo Hasselbach, to meet, he warned we wouldn't be able to talk ""out in the open"". 
g about toughening security measures against ""outsiders"" is that the threat also comes very much from within, these days. 
Intelligence chief Stephen Kramer describes this as one of the most disturbing developments in recent years.
""Today's extremists are not easily recognisable in public. We have Nazis wearing pinstriped suits, instead of sporting shaved heads; middle aged men wearing corduroy trousers - you wouldn't think were far right radicals. Never mind those on the far left who don't jump out as anarchist extremists. The number of those wanting to overturn our government, and way of life has spread like a cancer in the middle of society - and in growing parts, though it's still a minority - inside the establishment itself.""
Stephen Kramer underlines - like all members of Germany's security establishment this week - that, despite the arrests of the coup plotters and the ongoing investigation, they don't believe the safety of the German government or parliament was ever seriously compromised. Though the threat of violence was very real indeed.
""I... prepare for the worst and hope for the best,"" Kramer told me wryly. 
ure I get of Germany is very different to the reputation assumed outside the country - that of a rule-following, high-tech, low-profile, risk averse, middle of the road, safe and centrist society - embodied perhaps by the stereotype of former chancellor, Angela Merkel.
Nicholas Potter blames that stereotype on the fact that - all too long, in his opinion - far-right extremist attacks in Germany have been written off as the acts of ""lone wolves"". He cites the example of  the 2019 assassination of conservative politician and vocal defender of refugee and migrant rights, Walter Lübcke. The murderer was associated with the far-right German NPD party and the British extreme right group combat18.
""Of course you can focus on the parts of German society that are supposedly efficient or have good public transport or whatever but this [organised violence]... is also a part of modern German reality. It's not something that's been taken seriously enough to date - as we now see with the Reichsbürger network."""	/news/world-europe-63916809
sports	David Rudisha survives plane crash in Kenya	"Former double Olympic 800m champion David Rudisha was unharmed after a plane he was flying in crash-landed.
- carrying Rudisha and five others - came down in Kajiado county in south-east Kenya on Saturday. Photos show it upside down in a field.
Kenyan Rudisha, 33, described it as a ""scary episode"".
""All was well close to seven or eight minutes into the flight when the engine of the plane suddenly went quiet,"" he told the Daily Nation.external-link
""He (the pilot) saw some clear space where he tried to land the plane, but one of its wings hit a tree as the plane started to spin before landing on the rocky field.
""The pilot did an incredible job to keep the plane afloat and stable for long.""
Rudisha, who won gold at London 2012 and Rio 2016, is unharmed. One of the other occupants, Stephen Ole Marai, was being treated in hospital for rib injuries, while others were taken to hospital with minor injuries but later discharged.
Rudisha was returning from the annual Maasai Olympics at Kimana Wildlife Sanctuary in Kajiado county.
Now retired from top-level athletics, he has suggested that he is considering moving into coaching.

politics	Brexit-backing Next boss says UK needs more overseas workers	"Lord Wolfson said the UK needed a ""different approach"" to migration
f retailer Next is urging the government to let more foreign workers into the UK to ease labour shortages.  
Lord Wolfson, who was a prominent advocate of Brexit, said the UK's current immigration policy was crippling economic growth.
He said firms should pay a tax to employ foreign workers, to encourage them to recruit from the UK first.
government said it had delivered on its promise to ""take back control of our immigration system"".
""Unemployment is at record lows and it's vital we continue to bring in excellent key workers the UK needs, including thousands of NHS doctors and nurses through the Health and Care Visa and the Seasonal Workers scheme which brings in the workforce our farmers and growers need,"" a government spokesperson said.
Lord Wolfson, a Conservative peer, told the BBC: ""We have got people queuing up to come to this country to pick crops that are rotting in fields, to work in warehouses that otherwise wouldn't be operable, and we're not letting them in.
""And we have to take a different approach to economically productive migration.""
He said that the government needed to decide whether the UK was an open free trading nation, or whether post-Brexit it wanted to be ""fortress Britain"", pulling up the drawbridge to foreign workers at significant cost to the economy. 
""I think in respect of immigration, it's definitely not the Brexit that I wanted, or indeed, many of the people who voted Brexit wanted,"" he said.
""And we have to remember, you know, we're all stuck in this Brexit argument. We have to remember that what post-Brexit Britain looks like is not the preserve of those people that voted Brexit, it's for all of us to decide.""
He added that the majority of people in Britain have a ""very pragmatic view"" of immigration.
""Yes, control it, where it's damaging to society, but let people in who can contribute,"" Lord Wolfson said. 
He suggested a market-based solution to fix current labour shortages, which have affected sectors including healthcare, hospitality and logistics. 
He suggested that businesses who need foreign workers should be able to pay a tax of 10% to the government on foreign workers' salaries to ensure that only the businesses that really couldn't find UK workers would recruit overseas.  
""It would automatically mean that businesses never brought someone into the company from outside if they could find someone in the UK,"" he said. ""But if they genuinely can't, they'll pay the premium.""
According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, net migration to the UK was estimated to be about 239,000 in the year ending June 2021, a slight fall from the previous year's figure of 260,000. The figure was driven by immigration from non-European Union countries.
When the UK was a member of the EU, it came under the principle of free movement that allowed all EU nationals to live and work in any EU country.
But on 31 December 2020, this freedom ended for EU citizens coming to the UK, and for UK citizens going to the EU.
Last month, a survey by the CBI business lobby group found nearly three-quarters of UK companies had suffered from labour shortages in the past 12 months.
Nearly half of the companies surveyed wanted the government to grant temporary visas for roles that were in ""obvious shortage"", the CBI said.
In the summer, the aviation industry asked for special immigration visas for overseas workers but the request was rejected. Understaffing in the industry had been blamed for flight cancellations and delays at airports.  
government has introduced a skilled worker visa scheme for some occupations facing shortages. It also has a seasonal workers scheme to cover jobs such as fruit pickers, and a Health and Care Visa for medical staff.
Lord Wolfson admitted that 2023 would be very tough for consumers and businesses but insisted that many businesses should not expect government support that should be targeted at the most needy.  
He said ""the last thing we want them to do"" is to give money to businesses that don't really need it, because the government needed to focus ""very limited resources on the people that most need help during the upcoming recession"".
""That's the people who are going to be cold, and people who are going to be hungry, not businesses that want a break on their taxes,"" he said. 
Lord Wolfson is widely considered to be one of the canniest brains in UK business, and while he conceded next year would be tough, there were reasons for optimism.  
Firstly, unlike the recessions of the early 1980s and 90s, when whole industries and regions saw work opportunities disappear, very few workers would be unable to find employment.  
""While people will be squeezed, it's very unlikely that they won't be able to find work,"" he said.
Secondly, he said that there were already signs - in the prices being quoted for future raw materials at the end of next year - that 2024 could see a strong bounce back from recession.  
""The interesting thing about a supply side recession is that the seeds of correction are automatically certain. So as demand drops, and factories begin to empty, then prices begin to come down,"" he said. 
""Next year will be tough but there is no need for a national nervous breakdown,"" he added."	/news/business-63573988
sports	Josh Warrington: Briton rules out retirement and targets Leigh Wood fight	"Josh Warrington has categorically ruled out retirement but admits he has had sleepless nights following his defeat by Luis Alberto Lopez at Leeds Arena.
Lopez, 29, stunned Warrington on home soil earlier this month to become the new IBF featherweight champion.
""The first few nights were difficult because I closed my eyes and all I could do was see him celebrating,"" Warrington, 32, told BBC Sport.
""It was hard to close my eyes and see him jumping around, holding my belt.""
He added: ""I turned one side of the pillow, close my eyes, see him again.
""Then I turn the other side, close my eyes and I'd see him again.""
Warrington is a two-time world champion, with 31 victories, and says the defeat by Lopez has motivated him to return as soon as possible.
""On Monday and Tuesday [following the loss] I wanted to put my trainers on and start running. I wanted to get back into the gym,"" he said.
""If I didn't have those feelings, it would be time to call it a day but it's still there, that fire is still there.
""I've just lost a majority decision and people say it could have gone either way.
""I've not been disgraced, and I finished the fight stronger than he did but maybe I just got it wrong at the start. I've still got it and I want to put it right next year.""
Warrington is now hoping for a domestic fight with Leigh Wood or a trilogy with Mauricio Lara but understands he is now ""the B-side"".
""Leigh Wood is going to be out soon and there's talks about him facing Lara - why can't I have the winner out of them two? I've got to be patient now because I've kind of gone on to the B-side,"" Warrington said. 
""They [Wood and his team] still want the fight because it's a big fight domestically. 
""That fight will bring a lot of pounds to the table and brings a lot of attention.""
After the defeat, 'The Leeds Warrior' posted an emotional message with his daughters on social media. 
""It puts things into perspective that there's more to life. I'm just daddy to them,"" Warrington said.
""They came in, grabbed me, and cuddled me, said 'daddy you are a champion', and [my wife] took the photo because it was a special moment and I thought I'd share that.
""We are all good here because a lot of people can go dark, but we are all good over here.""
Lopez inflicted Warrington's second loss after fellow Mexican Lara knocked him out in February 2021.
Warrington admits he struggled to process that first defeat but says he will not allow the Lopez result to affect his personal life.
""The girls, some of my mates and some of my other family members suffered when I lost to Lara because I shut myself away. It was my girls' birthday the day after the fight, and I was trying to force myself to smile, and they suffered from that,"" he said.
""It's Christmas and they are really excited. They are at an age now where everything is magical, and I said I'm not going to let them suffer because of that."""	/sport/boxing/64015184

In his new diaries on the pandemic, the MP says in January 2020 he was told by England's chief medical officer the toll was ""a reasonable case scenario""  if restrictions were not introduced.
Figures show more than 200,000 people with Covid have died in the UK to date.
government has set up an inquiry into its handling of the pandemic.
In his new book, Mr Hancock says that when he mentioned the projected death toll to other cabinet ministers, their reaction was ""somewhat 'shrug shrug' - essentially because they didn't really believe it"".
He wrote: ""I am constantly feeling that others, who aren't focused on this every day, are weeks behind what's going on.""
He said that 11 days later, England's chief medical officer Sir Chris Whitty also warned transmission would be so high that ""almost everyone would catch it"".
Mr Hancock wrote: ""In his characteristically understated way, sitting at the back peeling a tangerine, Chris Whitty quietly informed everyone that in the reasonable worst-case scenario as many as 820,000 people in the UK may die.... The whole room froze. We are looking at a human catastrophe on a scale not seen here for a century.""

politics	Can age verification stop children seeing pornography?	"government is insisting its amendments to the Online Safety Bill will keep children safe on the internet.
Powers to define legal but harmful content have been dropped - satisfying some free-speech advocates.
Safety groups say it's too easy for children to access pornography online.
But ministers reject criticism that the legislation has been watered down, pointing to what they say is better age verification for children.
Research by regulator Ofcom indicates that one in three children currently have access to adult content on social media. They simply lie about their date of birth to get round age restrictions on websites.
As part of the bill, all sites that publish pornography will have to put in enhanced checks to ensure their users really are 18 or over.
uld include adults using secure age verification technology to prove that they possess a credit card and are over 18, or having a third-party service confirm their age against government data.
Sites that fail to act could be fined up to 10% of their global turnover by Ofcom, and bosses of these websites could also be held criminally liable if they fail to co-operate.
Children's safety groups have long been calling for age verification on porn sites, over fears it is too easy for minors to access publicly available material online.
re were proposals to use what's known as porn blockers - which would have forced commercial porn providers to verify users' ages or face a UK ban - but they were dropped in 2019.
Will Gardner, CEO of Childnet International, told the BBC: ""In the offline world we have robust systems to prevent children from accessing things which may harm them. 
""People have to show ID before purchasing pornography, alcohol and cigarettes, or before watching an 18 film at the cinema. We want to carry these same protections into the online environment.""
re are widespread concerns that exposure to porn is affecting the way young people understand healthy relationships, sex and consent. 
Experts who work with children say it puts them at risk from predators and could possibly stop them reporting abuse.
According to online safety group Internet Matters, more than half of mothers fear it gives their children a poor portrayal of women.
It will be up to companies to decide how best to comply with the new rules, but Ofcom may recommend the use of certain age verification technologies.
Already the UK's largest site with adult content, OnlyFans, has adopted age verification for all new UK subscribers, using third-party tools provided by Yoti and Ondato.
Despite the widespread use of age verification technology in sectors such as online gambling, there are still fears it poses privacy risks. Campaigners have warned that a database of pornography users would be a huge hacking target for blackmailers.
Monica Horten, of the Open Rights Group, which campaigns to preserve digital rights and freedoms, said the bill created a ""Hobson's choice"" about content for children.
She said platforms would have to ""either lock them out entirely, or sanitise their platform to the level of the youngest child likely to access their service"".
Ms Horten added the only alternative would be to ""guess the age"" of users with AI systems using biometric data which she said ""raised serious privacy concerns"".
But Iain Corby, executive director of the Age Verification Providers Association, said firms he represented had developed a wide range of methods to prove someone's age online without disclosing their identity to the websites they visit.
""Just as someone on the door of a nightclub might guess your age by how old you look, for those who are well over a legal age artificial intelligence software can estimate your age based on a selfie or even a voice recording, and has been tested to prove it is generally far more accurate than the average bouncer.  
""Where there is a stricter legal limit, more traditional forms of age verification may be needed, such as the use of a passport or driving licence. 
""The essence of these methods is they allow you prove your age without giving away your identity, so you can remain anonymous online if you wish.""  "	/news/technology-63794796
business	Decision on energy bill support for businesses postponed	"A decision on extending help for businesses facing soaring energy bills will not be made until the new year, the Treasury has said.
Currently wholesale gas and electricity prices have been fixed for firms from October until March 2023, but the help is under review due to the cost.
Ministers had promised to make an announcement before the end of 2022, and the delay angered business groups.
was creating uncertainty for firms worried about their bills.
""Disappointing news that government has also postponed announcement on future energy support until the New Year rather than before Christmas as previously announced,"" tweeted Kate Nicholls, boss of UK Hospitality, which represents hotels, restaurants and others in the industry.
""Businesses are facing daily changing rates and contract decisions in Jan so certainty was really needed."" 
Unlike households, businesses are not covered in normal times by an energy price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge per unit of energy. 
But after energy prices spiked this year, the government's Energy Bill Relief Scheme fixed costs, providing a lifeline for many firms that risked going bust without the support. 
In October the government said it would review the scheme due to its high cost to taxpayers and publish those findings by the end of this year. Officials are considering options to extend support only for ""vulnerable businesses"". 
On Monday, the Treasury said its final decision would now not be announced until the start of 2023.
""We are protecting businesses from high energy costs this winter, caused by Putin's invasion of Ukraine, through the six-month £18bn Energy Bill Relief Scheme,"" a spokesperson said.
""However, this is very expensive, and we need to ensure longer-term affordability and value for money for the taxpayer.
""That is why we are currently carrying out a review with the aim of reducing the public finances' exposure to volatile international energy prices from April 2023. We will announce the outcome of this review in the New Year to ensure businesses have sufficient certainty about future support before the current scheme ends in March 2023.""
Business groups have been calling for the government to provide certainty to businesses on energy support. 
On Monday, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) urged the government to make an announcement before Christmas, saying many of its members would struggle to pay their energy bills when the scheme comes to an end.
""Just over a month ago, the chancellor promised businesses that they would receive a plan on the future of the energy support package before the end of the year. With 24 hours left until parliament rises, businesses have one simple question: 'Where is this plan?'"" said Shevaun Haviland, its director general.

technology	Microsoft Activision deal could lessen competition, UK watchdog finds	"Microsoft's plan to buy Activision Blizzard could substantially lessen competition in consoles, multi-game subscription services and game streaming, a UK watchdog has said.
Microsoft wants to buy the maker of Overwatch, Candy Crush and Call of Duty for $68.7bn (£59.2bn).
But the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says its concerns mean it may now carry out an in-depth probe.
Microsoft said it was ready to work with the CMA on the ""next steps"".
If the deal goes through it will be the Xbox maker's largest ever acquisition.
games Activision Blizzard make are some of the most popular in the world. But it has previously faced accusations of permitting a toxic and sexist work-place culture.
In its ruling, the CMA said that it was concerned that if Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard it could harm rivals, ""by refusing them access to Activision Blizzard games or providing access on much worse terms"".
Sorcha O'Carroll, senior director of mergers at the CMA, said: ""Microsoft could use its control over popular games like Call of Duty and World of Warcraft post-merger to harm rivals.
""If our current concerns are not addressed, we plan to explore this deal in an in-depth Phase 2 investigation to reach a decision that works in the interests of UK gamers and businesses."" 
marks the end of the CMA's initial investigation, Phase 1 as it is called. At Phase 2, the CMA appoints an independent panel to examine the deal in more depth.
If after that CMA finds that a merger is problematic it will take steps to remedy its bad effects. That could mean stopping the merger, or allowing it to proceed but only if certain conditions are met.
In response to the news Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement, ""We're ready to work with the CMA on next steps and address any of its concerns. 
""Sony, as the industry leader, says it is worried about Call of Duty, but we've said we are committed to making the same game available on the same day on both Xbox and PlayStation. We want people to have more access to games, not less."" 
Microsoft maintains that its principal interest in the planned acquisition is Activision Blizzard's expertise in mobile gaming.
firm's head of gaming, Phil Spencer, told Bloomberg that ""the biggest gaming platform on the planet is mobile phones"" an area in which Microsoft lacked expertise.
Currently Activision games can be played on both Xbox and rival PlayStation consoles, but the proposed takeover have led some to speculate that more games might become Xbox exclusives.
mething Mr Smith previously denied in an interview with CNBC, telling the network that ""Great titles like Call of Duty... will continue to be available on the Sony PlayStation"".
He drew parallels with the firm's 2014 acquisition of Minecraft where he said the company had invested in the game and brought it to more platforms.
was reiterated in a blog post by Phil Spencer published on Thursday.
Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard, an eye watering deal worth almost $70bn, shook the games industry.
wo are both absolute giants, and their merger would make them a behemoth.
US tech giant, which owns Xbox, has aggressive gaming ambitions and deep pockets. It owns 23 games studios, including Minecraft maker Mojang, and Bethesda, creator of Fallout and SkyRim.
Activision Blizzard's greatest hits include Call of Duty, Overwatch, Skylander and Diablo.
Sony - owner of the world's best-selling games console, the PlayStation - has said publicly that it ""expects"" Microsoft to keep these enormous titles multi-platform.
But Microsoft's Phil Spencer says what he's really interested in now is the mobile gaming market, and Activision also happens to own Candy Crush Saga - a simple, ten year old game which remains one of the most popular mobile games of all time.
It's no wonder that the competition regulators are now putting this deal even further under the microscope. They need to be certain that a merger of this size won't completely crush the market. 
Other countries, in addition to the UK, are carrying out their own anti-trust investigations - and last month Saudi Arabia became the first to approve the deal.
Some have pointed to previous takeovers for evidence that the deal might lead to more new Activision Blizzard games becoming exclusive to Microsoft owned platforms.
Last year, Microsoft successfully purchased the parent company of Fallout maker Bethesda Softworks for $7.5bn (£6.46bn).
At the time the Mr Spencer said, ""some new titles in the future that will be exclusive to Xbox and PC players"".
And in a tweet Xbox's Aaron Greenberg confirmed that Starfield, a game announced by Bethseda three years prior to the purchase in 2018, will not be released on PlayStation.
Some independent game-makers have also been worried they might be marginalised in Microsoft's Netflix-like game subscription service Game Pass if the deal went through, and the firm began favouring its own titles.
But Sony, which makes PlayStation, has also been acquiring studios, purchasing game-maker Bungie for $3.7bn in June."	/news/technology-62725366
health	Strep A schools in Scotland could get antibiotics	"Pupils at schools with cases of streptococcus A could get preventative antibiotics following nine deaths linked to the bacteria across the UK.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said he would be issuing advice on the matter, adding the whole health service was ""on alert"" for cases.
re have been no deaths from severe strep disease in Scotland.
However, Mr Yousaf said he expected cases to increase over the coming weeks.
It comes after the issue of preventative antibiotics was raised in the House of Lords on Monday.
Parents are being urged to be vigilant for symptoms and to promptly contact their GP or NHS24 if they have any concerns.
It is not known how many cases of strep have been identified in Scotland, but the health secretary said they have not exceeded previous peak levels.
On Tuesday Mr Yousaf was asked by Scottish Conservative MSP Sandesh Gulhane whether the Scottish government was considering preventative antibiotics for schools.
In response, Mr Yousaf said: ""I've asked Public Health Scotland (PHS) and my clinical colleagues to give advice to that effect.
""What I would say is the levels of GAS infection we're seeing, those cases are mild. 
""But we're not complacent, we do expect cases to rise over the coming weeks hence why I've asked clinicians to give advice on the very issue Sandesh Gulhane has raised.""
Scottish government later issued a statement saying routine proactive use of antibiotics is ""not currently recommended"", but it may be considered by clinicians on a case-by-case basis.
Prof Jim McManus, who is president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme there had been ""too much hype"" over the English guidance.
He said: ""There are cases under the English guidance where antibiotics will be given if there are children in the school connected in an epidemiological way like siblings or they may have the same infection to a child that has been hospitalised. 
""What I don't think you'll see is an entire year group being given them because the benefit would be minimal, antibiotic resistance would be significant and actually the antibiotic supply itself doesn't allow us to give penicillin to an entire school.""
Strep A is a bacteria sometimes found in the throat or on the skin.
Many people carry it harmlessly without even knowing, but they can spread it to others who might become ill.
People can catch it through close contact and from coughs and sneezes, meaning outbreaks can sometimes happen in places like schools and care homes.
Most often, symptoms are mild - a sore throat or a skin infection that can be easily treated with antibiotics.
But strep A can cause a range of things - and some of them are more serious.
One is scarlet fever, which mostly affects young children and, again, needs antibiotics.
Very rarely, strep A can cause invasive group-A streptococcal infection (iGAS), which can be deadly.
Public Health Scotland guidance states that strep A peaks usually occur every three to four years, and the last time there were a significant number of cases was during the winter of 2017-18.
It also suggests social distancing measures during the Covid-19 pandemic could have interrupted this cycle.
For scarlet fever, for example, in the week of the 14 to 20 November this year there were 851 cases reported - a rise compared to the average of 186 cases seen in recent years.
Mr Yousaf added that PHS has issued an alert to all health care services, including GPs, to be aware of strep A and to take a ""low threshold"" to prescribing antibiotics.
He mentioned recent reports which suggested the UK faces a shortage of the antibiotic amoxicillin, a type of penicillin which is used to treat strep A.
However, the health secretary said he had checked with clinicians and the chief pharmaceutical officer, and heard there was no shortage in Scotland.

""This is about making sure that there has to be stability in that process,"" he said.
""You can't just have a crisis that moves a divided territory into another divided territory.""
According to the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, there would be no change to Northern Ireland's constitutional status without the consent of a majority of people of Northern Ireland.
However, Mr Paisley said a weighted majority of more than 50% plus one in a referendum would show ""overwhelming consent"".
upport of DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Mr Paisley added. 
But the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MP Claire Hanna said the bill will ""never be debated"".
Ms Hanna said it was ""essentially just a trolling exercise from someone who has decided against being a serious political actor"".
Alliance Party MP, Stephen Farry, described the bill as a ""stunt"" which will ""never be debated, never mind voted upon in Parliament"".
""This is going absolutely nowhere,"" he told BBC News NI.
If passed, the bill would also affect a vote on Scottish independence."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63528135
business	Cancelled flights: Travel firms have oversold flights and holidays - Shapps	"Airlines and operators have ""seriously oversold flights and holidays"" relative to their capacity to deliver, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said.
Mr Shapps said it had been ""very distressing"" to see people facing more disruption at airports with ""holidays cancelled and plans left in disarray"".
Passengers are facing travel problems ahead of the Jubilee weekend, with several airlines cancelling flights.
Up to two million people are preparing to fly over the next few days.
majority of flights will be operating as scheduled, said Airlines UK which represents Tui, EasyJet and British Airways.
Mr Shapps said the government had been clear that it was up to industry leaders to tackle travel disruption, which was also seen at Easter.
ransport secretary said he would meet with airports, airlines and ground handlers to ""find out what's gone wrong and how they are planning to end the current run of cancellations and delays"".
""Despite government warnings, operators seriously oversold flights and holidays relative to their capacity to deliver. This must not happen again and all efforts should be directed at there being no repeat of this over the summer - the first post-Covid summer season,"" he added. 
Passengers are facing ongoing disruption ahead of the bank holiday weekend, with holiday giant Tui announcing it will cancel six flights a day until the end of June, affecting around 34,000 travellers in all.
Around 10,000 flights are set to leave the UK between Thursday and Sunday, according to aviation analytics firm Cirium.
Other airlines, including EasyJet, have also cancelled flights, with the aviation industry suffering from staff shortages as it struggles to recruit replacements for the thousands of workers it laid off during the coronavirus pandemic when international travel halted.
Before Covid, airports and airlines across Britain employed around 140,000 people, but since then thousands of jobs have been cut, including around 30,000 for UK airlines alone.
Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency and a former Virgin Atlantic director, said the industry had been ""overwhelmed"" since demand for flights returned after the pandemic but argued the government itself was ""responsible for this chaos"".
""[The transport secretary] has got a bit of a nerve I'm afraid,"" he told the BBC. ""It's because of government restrictions that changed so much during the pandemic, and then the shutdown of the industry with the Omicron variant last December, that has created this problem.""
He added that without certainty over when travel restrictions would be eased, the industry was not able to recruit more staff.
Kelly Sandhu, from the Aviation Recruitment Network, said the process of hiring new workers took a long time so there was ""not a quick fix"" .
Airlines UK said the sector had ""only a matter of weeks to recover and prepare for one of the busiest summers we've seen in many years"" but, despite this, ""the vast majority"" of flights this week would be operating as scheduled.
Michael Turner, a nurse from Shoreham, has abandoned his family holiday to Tenerife after their flights were cancelled three times.
Due to fly from Gatwick last Thursday, Mr Turner was told his EasyJet flight had been cancelled 20 minutes before departure. 
He rebooked a Tui flight which was all that was available and said he experienced ""absolute chaos"" in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport.  
After boarding the plane, Mr Turner said they spent three hours waiting only to be then escorted off to collect their baggage.
were put on a coach without being told where they were going and then waited to be taken back to the airport for a flight on Tuesday evening.
But the family's flight was cancelled again and they have declined a fourth rescheduled flight offer for Wednesday instead opting to go home.
Manchester Airport said Tui and Swissport, which provides ground services such as baggage handling, were ""experiencing temporary staff shortages, in common with other aviation and travel companies"".
A spokesperson for Swissport apologised for its part in any disruption, adding that the return of demand for flights was ""exacerbating resource challenges across the aviation industry"". 
Elsewhere, Glasgow Airport said the airport had been ""busier than it has been for more than two years"", while at Edinburgh Airport some passengers had to queue outside the terminal building to check in luggage. 
Prospect, the union which represents staff across air traffic control and in aviation engineering, warned that things could ""get worse before they get better"". 
Garry Graham, its deputy general secretary, said that while the furlough scheme had helped people, the government had ignored that it ""ended well before the majority of international restrictions on travel came to an end"".
But Mr Shapps said the government had helped the industry through ""changing the law to speed up bringing in newly recruited staff"" as well as providing £8bn of support during the pandemic.
Airport Operators Association, which represents the industry, said big recruitment campaigns had been under way since before the start of this year and additional staff were now being deployed.

technology	Canada hit by massive mobile and internet outage	"Canada's largest mobile and internet provider has suffered a major outage, with bank ATMs and emergency service hotlines affected. 
Government operations have also been hit by the Rogers Communications issue. The company says it is working rapidly to resolve the nationwide problem.
""We know how important it is for our customers to stay connected,"" the company said in a statement.
It is not known what caused the outage, which is the second one in 15 months. 
It began at around 04:30 ET (08:30 GMT). Internet traffic had dropped to around 75% of its normal level by Friday morning, according to NetBlocks, an internet watchdog organisation. 
Rogers is the mobile carrier of nearly 11 million Canadians, with a stake in everything from hockey to cable television. 
ronto's police department tweeted that some mobile phone users were having trouble calling the emergency services, despite it remaining ""fully operational"". 
""If the call connects please stay on the call as long as possible,"" the force wrote, adding that people who cannot connect should call back.
Police in Ottawa tweeted: ""If your call fails, please try again, or call from a landline or cellphone with another provider.″
utages have also hit passport offices, courthouses and transit payment systems.  
On-call medical employees for the Scarborough Health Network, which operates hospitals in Toronto, have been asked to come into work until the issue is resolved.
In the Quebec province, a Montreal court delayed a trial hearing for disgraced fashion mogul Peter Nygard after jail officials were unable to connect him to a videoconference system. 
In urban areas, people have flocked to cafes and places with functioning Wi-Fi. 
""There's tonnes of people here with their laptops just working away ferociously, the same as they would at home, because they've got no service at home,"" one Starbucks customer in Toronto told Reuters. 
On Friday afternoon, the vice-president of Rogers told CBC that the company was still working to identify the ""root cause"" of the issue. 
""As of now, we don't have an ETA of when the problem will be fixed,"" said Kye Prigg.
""I wouldn't like to say whether it's going to be fully online today or not,"" he said, also declining to say whether cyberhackers may be to blame.

politics	Sir Laurie Magnus: Rishi Sunak appoints veteran banker as ethics chief	"Rishi Sunak has appointed veteran banker Sir Laurie Magnus as his new adviser on ministerial behaviour.
rime minister has been facing pressure to fill the role, which has been empty since the previous holder quit six months ago.
Sir Laurie, who also chairs Historic England, has been appointed to a non-renewable five-year term.
He will be responsible for advising Mr Sunak on whether ministers are complying with their conduct rulebook.
However, the prime minister will retain the power to decide whether ministers have broken the code, and on any subsequent punishments.
Boris Johnson's ethics adviser Lord Geidt quit in June after conceding Mr Johnson may have himself broken ministerial rules over Partygate.
His predecessor, Sir Alex Allan, quit in 2020 after Mr Johnson overruled him over a report into alleged bullying by Home Secretary Priti Patel.
Mr Sunak's predecessor as prime minister Liz Truss signalled during the summer Tory leadership she would not appoint anyone to the role, telling party members ""I don't think you can outsource ethics to an adviser"".
But Mr Sunak said filling the role was a priority when he took office in October, promising to restore ""integrity, professionalism and accountability at every level"".
Sir Laurie will not lead the ongoing investigation into deputy PM Dominic Raab, who is facing eight complaints about his behaviour in previous government roles.
A senior lawyer, Adam Tolley KC, was appointed to lead that probe last month, when the PM's adviser role was still unfilled. Mr Raab faces allegations he bullied staff, which he denies. 
Opposition parties and the Committee on Standards in Public Life, an anti-sleaze watchdog, have long called for the PM's adviser role to be beefed up.
rgue the role is ineffective because the adviser cannot decide to launch their own investigations, and the PM decides whether the ministerial code has been broken.
Mr Sunak, however, has decided that Sir Laurie should keep the same remit and powers as the previous holders of the role.
Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner criticised Mr Sunak for keeping the ""rotten ethics regime he inherited from his predecessors"".
""This weak prime minister is failing to deliver the integrity he promised, and instead has installed yet another toothless watchdog,"" she added.
Dave Penman, the boss of the FDA union representing senior civil servants, said Mr Sunak had missed an opportunity to ""reset the relationship"" between ministers and officials.
""Instead of that, he's followed exactly the same path as Boris Johnson did. So essentially he's continuity Johnson when it comes to the ministerial code,"" he added. 
Historic England, a public body, is responsible for caring for and listing historic buildings and sites.
As chairman, Sir Laurie oversaw the body's response to the toppling of a statue of 17th Century slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol in 2020 - which prompted a debate about the public commemoration of figures linked to the slave trade.
Later that year, Sir Laurie told MPs that Historic England's preference was to keep ""contested"" statues standing in public places - but to ""re-contextualise and reinterpret"" them through actions like updated inscriptions and artistic installations.
""If we do not do that, our collective past is going to be torn away slowly, piece-by-piece,"" he added.
""If we start tampering with the historic fabric associated with our collective past because things are contentious, we start changing the basis on which we can understand it."""	/news/uk-politics-64068356
health	Wales NHS: Prioritise patients waiting longest - minister	"NHS in Wales needs to ""speed up the process"" of treating people waiting over two years for hospital treatment, the health minister said.
Eluned Morgan said health boards need to prioritise the ""longest waiters and they're not always doing that"".
re are 59,350 people waiting over two years in Wales, although the number has fallen for a fifth month in a row.
Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents NHS health organisations, has been asked to comment.
In Wales, there are 183,450 operations and procedures waiting more than a year.
Overall waits - from referral to treatment - have passed 750,000.
Scotland has 7,650 patients waiting more than two years, England has 2,646.
Asked on BBC Politics Wales why so many more people are waiting longer in Wales, Ms Morgan said: ""Our health boards need to make sure that they're taking people from the longest waiters and they're not always doing that.""
Stewart Rathbone from Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, has been waiting for more than two years for a hip replacement.
58 year-old used to work on a dairy farm, which provided a house for his family to live in.
Unable to work because of his deteriorating hip, Mr Rathbone lost his job and had to move home.
""Financially, it destroyed me. As a family, it totally destroyed us,"" he said.
""If I'd had the operation at the outset... what happened to my family wouldn't have happened.
""I'd be probably still working on the same farm.""
In the Senedd last week, Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies raised incidents of people who had to wait hours for an ambulance, prompting an angry response from First Minister Mark Drakeford.
f Keith Morris, 79, who was left in pain on the floor for 15 hours while waiting for an ambulance, was one of those raised.
His daughter, life-long Labour voter, Andrea Morris Nicholas, told Politics Wales she was ""disappointed"" with Mr Drakeford's reaction, adding ""he has to take responsibility"".
Asked if the first minister and Welsh government accepted responsibility, Ms Morgan told Politics Wales: ""We're responsible for running the NHS. 
""I think what's important for people to understand is that we're limited by budgets.
""So, that means we don't have the money to spend on the NHS that we'd like to have at a time when demand is going through the roof.
""We've already recruited an additional 250 ambulance workers, we've got another 100 coming on line.
""They'll be ready by December... so, a bit later than we'd hoped, but had we not started that recruitment campaign back in April, we wouldn't be ready.""
Mr RT Davies told the programme the first minister's reaction in the Senedd - when Mr Drakeford accused the Conservatives of making a mess of the UK's finances and reputation - ""was beyond reprehensible"".
""I had the temerity as the leader of the opposition to turn up, point out two particular cases of individuals...who had to wait excessive times for ambulances to arrive,"" said Mr RT Davies.
""Now, that's my job, but for the first minister to try and deflect like he did on to the UK government really shows that the Welsh Labour government have run out of answers.
""Yes, the cash does come from Westminster, but it's up to the devolved governments to decide how they carve that up. 
""In the early parts, 2010 to 2015, the Welsh Labour government, the only government in the United Kingdom, voted to cut their NHS budget whereas all other governments - whether it be a nationalist government in Scotland, a Conservative government in Westminster or an executive in Northern Ireland - protected the health budget. 
""So, in there are the seeds of the problem that we are facing today,"" he added."	/news/uk-wales-63357412

£324 payment would be made directly into bank accounts between now and 23 November, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said.
who qualify via tax credits will receive it by the end of the month.
A first grant of £326 was paid earlier in the year and, together, they are designed to assist with rising bills.
upport, totalling £650, is for those across the UK on certain benefits, including Universal Credit and pension credit. It is the largest part of direct financial assistance from the government to tackle costs such as energy bills.
funds are paid directly into the same accounts used to receive benefits payments, with the reference of the recipients' national insurance number followed by ""DWP COL"".
Connor, 40, lives in the south west of England and says he has not yet received his latest cost-of living-payment.
With bills going up, he said he had planned his finances around receiving the payment this week.
""I'm annoyed there was no explanation about who gets the payment first. Some have already received their payment - they are the ones who receive disability payments. All I received was a text message saying I'd receive it some time between 8 and 23 November.
""That date range means I can't really plan properly - I was hoping to spend some of it on food and day-to-day stuff,"" adds Connor. ""I'm checking my bank account every hour to see if it's landed.""

Fifa 23 will be EA Sports' final game in the bestselling football series.

health	Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital praised in report	"A flagship hospital under investigation over fatal infections has been given a positive review by inspectors. 
Healthcare Improvement Scotland found Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) has ""generally good"" approaches to infection control. 
However, it also warned the facility was under ""significant"" staffing pressure, with dozens of wards carrying a risk rating of red.
rs visited the hospital in March and June this year.
A separate public inquiry is investigating its infection prevention measures after it emerged that patients have died after contracting infections at the hospital complex.
-year-old Milly Main died in 2017 after contracting an infection at the QEUH's Royal Hospital for Children's cancer ward, and senior Scottish government official Andrew Slorance died in 2020 with an infection caused by a fungus called aspergillus.
unannounced Healthcare Improvement Scotland inspection was said to be ""wide ranging"" and examined the prevention of aspergillus.
report noted a lack of national guidelines for identifying and controlling the potentially deadly fungal infection in hospitals. 
It added: ""This means patient protection relies on professional opinion and interpretation of a highly expert topic which may lead to a lack of a standard approach across NHS Scotland.""
Healthcare Improvement Scotland said it would recommend to the Scottish government that it consider creating national guidelines for the NHS. 
On staffing levels, the report stated: ""On the first day of our inspection, senior managers told us that 27 wards across the hospital campus scored a risk rating of red at the start of the day.
""This can result from staff numbers or the staff skill mix not being optimal.""
It said patients were happy with the cleanliness of the hospital and staff were adhering to infection control measures.
Donna Maclean, head of service at Healthcare Improvement Scotland, said the QEUH was contending with rising admissions, waiting times in emergency departments and reduced staff availability.
""These pressures are not isolated to this hospital, with similar pressures being experienced across NHS Scotland,"" she continued. 
""Despite the significant staff shortages across the campus, staff within the clinical areas told us they felt supported by senior leadership, and we observed clear communication throughout the inspection.
""We observed that most infection prevention and control practices carried out by staff working across all roles to support care delivery was generally good, and in line with infection control guidance and standards.""
report outlined ""areas of improvement"", which will be considered as part of an action plan being developed by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf welcomed the report and ""positive feedback"" from patients.
He added: ""Patient safety is paramount and the report highlights good infection prevention and control leadership at QEUH, a vigilant approach towards aspergillus infections, and strong communication across the multidisciplinary and infection prevention and control team.
""I note the HIS recommendation on the development of national guidance on the management of aspergillus infection and the Scottish government will give full consideration to this as part of its work in developing an interim healthcare associated infection strategy."" "	/news/uk-scotland-63809416

health	Cold water swimmers welcome Wales' sea water quality ranking	"85 out of 106 swimming areas in Wales are ranked excellent
Cold water swimmers in Wales say they have been given ""peace of mind"" after the water quality in 80% of bathing areas tested was ranked excellent.
ghest ranking was given to 85 of 106 places tested, with one ranked as poor.  
Penarth in Vale of Glamorgan was added to the rankings after a swimmer used new rules to get its water tested.
Welsh government has reaffirmed it will follow a European Commission directive on water quality.
106 water bodies assessed were categorised as excellent, good, sufficient or poor.
Marine Lake in Rhyl, Denbighshire, an artificial lake used mainly for water sports, was the only site to be classified as poor.
All 22 Blue Flag award beaches in Wales can now apply to retain their status for 2023.
Dawnstalkers is a group of about 100 cold water swimmers who brave the sea off Penarth each morning. 
With so many people using the water, swimmer James Tennet decided to ask Natural Resources Wales (NRW) to test it.
""No-one knew what the water quality was, there was such a range of answers, but there was absolutely no data,"" he said.
""I did a bit of research and it was a lot easier [to get it tested] than I imagined.""
Despite murkiness from estuary mud, results showed the water ranked excellent.
""It's peace of mind,"" he said.
""Swimming is getting more popular, you want it to be a safe environment so we want to encourage more people to swim too.""
Mae Frank, 25, said she enjoyed her early morning swims: ""It's a good start to the day.
""It gives you a big surge of energy for the rest of the day, you're super productive afterwards. 
Mae said she was pleased with the water rating at Penarth.
""In the summer there were all the alerts about water quality in different places, but we were lucky here that it kept in the green zone,"" she said.
Chelsea Smith, 32, is another Dawnstalkers member who said cold water swimming sets them up for the day.
""We're getting to red leg weather where everything gets pins and needles and it's a little bit painful but as soon as you've done it, it's the best start to the day,"" she said.  
Chelsea said she was concerned about water quality prior to this testing: ""I know people who've got tummy bugs off swimming in other places or going surfing because they didn't know what's been put in the sea.""
Welsh government Climate Change Minister Julie James said she wanted to designate more lakes and reservoirs as bathing waters to ""encourage everyone of all shapes, sizes and abilities to don their costumes and brave our brisk waters"".
NRW collected and analysed water samples throughout 2022, with chief executive Clare Pillman saying she was ""incredibly proud of the improvements we've seen in our bathing waters in recent decades"".

technology	US midterms: How BBC's voter profiles were shown hate and disinformation online	"Disinformation and Social Media correspondent Marianna Spring set up a series of social media accounts to investigate what voters are being recommended online at a turbulent time for US politics. After over two months of running the profiles, this is what she found. 
I open up Britney's Instagram and click on an account that's been recommended in her feed. I'm greeted by a meme falsely declaring that President Joe Biden never really won the 2020 election, and several others targeting named female politicians with misogynistic comments and abusive language. 
Britney is one of five profiles I've created to track what US voters can be recommended and exposed to online ahead of the midterm elections. While social media sites say they are committed to tackling disinformation and hate on their platforms ahead of the poll, for my undercover voters, misleading and violent posts appear to have only increased in recent weeks. 
My five voters were created to represent views from across the US political spectrum, based on data gathered by the Pew Research Centre. I gave each of them a profile on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter, with names and computer-generated photos.  
re: 
For all of them, I followed additional accounts when they were suggested, as well as keeping up their original interests. 
While these profiles can't offer an exhaustive insight into what every US voter could be seeing - and they don't have friends or followers - they do give us a snapshot of what voters across the political spectrum are being exposed to. 
Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), which tracks extremism and disinformation worldwide, says that election conspiracy claims and abusive language aimed at politicians online have intensified in the run-up to the midterms.
As I've checked into each of my undercover voters' accounts over the past two months, it's Britney's that have been most frequently exposed to violent and misleading content.  
When setting up her account, I liked pages and accounts that supported Mr Trump, opposed mandatory vaccination and questioned the motives of billionaires. These topics appear to have been a gateway to more extreme content, when compared with the other undercover voters. 
Larry was exposed to posts featuring misleading claims about the 2020 election and abusive language directed at politicians, while Emma was also recommended several pages using abusive language aimed at supporters of Donald Trump and Supreme Court Justices, but nothing on the scale of what Britney was recommended. 
When I logged onto Instagram in particular, I found she was recommended more and more accounts that made false claims about fraudulent voting and denied that President Biden won the election. 
regularly featured hashtags like #Trumpwon in their profile descriptions and on their posts, and shared memes about the riots on the Capitol claiming that ""January 6th wasn't an insurrection"".
Britney's profile was also shown TikTok videos from accounts promoting conspiracy theories that the election was rigged, also repeating the phrase ""Trump Won"". 
Last week, Instagram showed her conspiracy theories contradicting the police account of what happened when Paul Pelosi, the husband of US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was violently attacked in their home. Posts also made light of the violence. 
Finally, pages recommended to Britney's Instagram account also featured posts talking about female politicians in abusive and misogynistic terms. 
most frequent targets were Nancy Pelosi, Kamala Harris, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton. There were comments about them performing sex acts, and slurs about their appearances, alongside criticism of their politics. While posts often spoke about Joe Biden and Donald Trump in hateful terms, they were not subject to the same sexualised language.
guage was unique to Britney's accounts. On Facebook, Emma was recommended pages that promoted naming and shaming racists and Trump supporters, but the rhetoric had not escalated in the same way. 
Gabriela was increasingly recommended right-leaning content on social media, often about inflation and the cost of living crisis, but it stopped short of the more extreme disinformation and hate that Britney encountered. 
Larry and Michael were targeted more frequently by official campaign adverts and content from the political parties themselves, especially on sites like YouTube. For Larry, the messaging was focused on crime, inflation and immigration. For Michael, the adverts and posts talked about abortion, climate change and education.
As well as noting the uptick in hate ahead of the midterms, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue says disinformation online has focused on conspiracies about the Biden administration, as well as the issue of voting in specific US states. 
""That, when combined with social media product features and failed policies, is giving permission to more hate and vitriol,"" said Jiore Craig, the ISD's Head of Elections and Digital Integrity.
In particular, the ISD found election conspiracy theories in short-form video formats across several platforms. Social media companies have ""inconsistent and insufficient moderation policies"" to deal with this kind of content, its research concludes. 
research also expresses concerns that the major social media companies are not taking election denials seriously, although they have made various commitments to tackling disinformation and hate ahead of the midterms.
In August, Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - said it would devote ""hundreds of people across more than 40 teams"" to ensure the security and safety of the midterms, and apply ""learnings"" from the past election. 
Meta told the BBC that it has robust measures in place to combat misinformation, including partnerships with 10 fact-checking organisations in the US.
It also said it has ""clear policies about what is and isn't allowed on our platforms"" and ""continually reviews content"" to see if it violates policies. 
kTok also announced its own ""commitment to election integrity"" ahead of the vote, saying it had partnered with fact-checking organisations. It told the BBC it took its ""responsibility to protect the integrity of our platform and elections with utmost seriousness"".
Populist Right Britney, Progressive Left Emma and even Apolitical Gabriela have been recommended increasingly polarised content on Twitter over the past two months, particularly on immigration, crime and climate change. 
Britney's account was also shown a conspiracy theory shared by Elon Musk about the attack on Mr Pelosi - Mr Musk later deleted his tweet. 
re are concerns that lay-offs and potential changes to moderation policies on Twitter, which Mr Musk now owns, could also lead to an increase in online disinformation just before voters head to the polls.
Several of the Instagram accounts that Britney has been recommended promoting claims that Trump really won the 2020 election have also praised Mr Musk for buying Twitter and referenced their plans to return to the site. 
witter says that while it has lost employees, their ""core moderation capabilities remain in place""."	/news/world-us-canada-63530374
technology	UK looks to Sweden for a solution to nuclear waste	"In deep, astonishingly clear, blue-lit ponds some 40m (130ft) beneath the Swedish countryside, lies decades worth of high-level nuclear waste.
It is an oddly beautiful and rather disturbing sight. Row upon row of long metal containers, filled with used nuclear fuel from the country's reactors, lie below the surface near Oskarshamn, on Sweden's Baltic coast.
It is both highly lethal and entirely safe. 
Lethal, because this material is intensely radioactive; safe, because it sits beneath 8m of water, a very effective barrier against radiation.
Waste can be kept like this for decades. In fact, it needs to be. 
Intense radioactivity generates a great deal of heat, and this kind of material has to be cooled for long periods before it can be removed for storage. 
question of what to do with it afterwards, though, is one that many governments, including that of the UK, have been grappling with for years.
roblem is not quantity. 
Even after some 60 years of commercial and military programmes the UK's stockpile of the most dangerous high-level waste amounts to a few thousand tonnes, although there are also several hundred thousand tonnes of intermediate-level waste which will have to be dealt with as well.
real issue is time. 
""Used fuel assemblies are intensely radioactive, and that radioactivity takes a long time to decay,"" explains Prof Neil Hyatt, chief scientific adviser to the UK's Nuclear Waste Services.
""After about 1,000 years, about 10% of the original radioactivity is left, and that will slowly decay away over about 100,000 years or so.""
reates unique difficulties.
""We can't rely on institutional control for timescales of much longer than a few centuries,"" says Prof Hyatt.
""The Roman Empire lasted about 500 years. The last ice age ended about 10,000 years ago. 
""So the surface of the Earth and human civilisations change much more quickly than the rate at which the radioactivity in this spent nuclear fuel can decay.""
Sweden has already reached its own conclusions. It plans to bury its waste in rock deep underground and leave it there for good.
rocess known as geological disposal, and the country's scientists have spent decades studying different ways in which it could be carried out.
Much of the research has been carried out in the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory, a facility built near Oskarshamn in the south of the country.
Hundreds of metres beneath the surface, a network of huge man-made caverns has been drilled into the rock. 
It is being used for experiments, looking at how wastes could be packaged and entombed, and at how the materials being used might degrade over time.
rock here is fissured and running with salt water - ancient brine that has migrated from the Baltic Sea far above over thousands of years.
Such a damp environment would not be suitable for a real disposal facility. But according to Ylva Stenqvist, a project director at the country's nuclear operator SKB, it is perfect for testing.
""This site was picked because it is quite wet,"" she explains.
""Because if we try our experiments in an area which is really dry, we have to wait for ages for any kind of results. 
""So we consciously chose this place to accelerate some of the experiments, to really stress our materials and our methods and see how they stand up in this quite aggressive environment.""
Earlier this year the Swedish government approved plans for a real geological disposal facility (GDF), to be built at Forsmark, some 150km north of Stockholm.
roject is expected to cost about 19bn Swedish kroner (£1.5bn; $1.8bn), and create 1,500 jobs, though construction will take decades. Work on a similar scheme, across the Baltic Sea in Finland, began in 2015.
ments are being watched carefully from the UK, which also intends to build a GDF, though repeated attempts to find a suitable location have been stymied by political intransigence, as well as by intense opposition from local protesters and environmentalists.
Current efforts to find a site and a population willing to host it now follow a ""consent based"" approach, under which the government body Nuclear Waste Services sets up partnerships with local communities in order to engage them in the process.
As an incentive, those communities are offered £1m in investment for local initiatives when they sign up, with that figure rising to £2.5m if deep drilling operations take place.
Since this process began in 2018, four such partnerships have been set up. 
ree are in Cumbria. They include the section of coastline that is already home to the Sellafield nuclear plant and many of its workers. The fourth, and most recent, was established in Theddlethorpe, Lincolnshire.
Scotland is not part of this process, and the Scottish government currently does not support deep geological disposal.
Even in the areas where partnerships have been set up, strong opposition remains.
""We are vehemently opposed to the geological disposal of hot, heat-generating nuclear waste,"" says Marianne Birkby of Cumbria protest group Radiation Free Lakeland.
""The waste should remain where it can be monitored, where it can be repacked, and where it can be retrieved if something goes horribly wrong,"" she insists. ""Below ground there would be absolutely no chance of containment if a leak occurred.""
More technology of business:
It is unlikely that a site for a UK GDF will be settled upon for at least another 15 years. But some experts question whether it should ever be built at all.
Among them is Dr Paul Dorfman, associate fellow of the science policy research unit at the University of Sussex and chair of the Nuclear Consulting Group, an anti-nuclear energy organisation.
""Geological disposal is a concept, not a reality,"" he explains. ""There is significant scientific uncertainty about whether the materials which would be used can survive the depredations of time.""
He believes the government's enthusiasm for new nuclear power stations is the reason why it is pushing to build a GDF.
""If you can't get rid of the waste, you can't produce more, which means that nuclear's USP - that it's climate-friendly and so on - is completely dependent on the notion that you can get rid of this waste,"" he says.
""Geological disposal is in fact, unfortunately, a nuclear fig leaf.""

sports	Commonwealth Games: Rosemary Lenton says she is 'dreaming' after winning gold aged 72	"Dumfries pensioner Rosemary Lenton has become the Commonwealth Games' oldest gold medallist.
72-year-old helped her country win the Para women's pairs bowls.
Lenton was making her debut at the Games.
""I think I am dreaming, to be be perfectly honest,"" Lenton told BBC Sport after linking up with Pauline Wilson to defeat Australia's Cheryl Lindfield and Serena Bonnell 17-5 in the gold-medal match at Leamington Spa's Victoria Park on Wednesday.
""It hasn't quite sunk in yet but this is absolutely fantastic. I never thought I would ever get to a Commonwealth Games and if I did, it would be as a spectator.""
Lenton and Wilson, 58, have a combined age of 130 but the pair proved age is no barrier, and there were joyous scenes on a day Lenton never thought she would experience.
Lenton is part of Team Scotland's Para-bowls team after reinventing her life when routine surgery led to an infection and a series of other operations.
She had been due to go and watch the Games in Manchester in 2002 as a spectator before health problems thwarted her.
Formerly a competitive sailor and cyclist who had gone on charity rides to China and Russia, she took up bowls in 2005 and has competed in three world championships, winning a silver medal in one. 
She went on to take up wheelchair curling and has competed in nine world championships.
""I hadn't played the sport [bowls] until I ended up in a wheelchair in 2002,"" Lenton said in an interview before the Games.
""I went into hospital for what was meant to be a straightforward operation but I got an infection and had to have nine operations and was in hospital for three months.
""I struggled going back to work for three years before I had to give it up in 2005. I took up bowls, really as a social thing, to get myself out of the house and mix with people. 
""When I was at bowls, someone suggested wheelchair curling too. You can't sit at home and wait for the world to come to you, you have to make the effort and go out and meet others.""
Lenton was forced to appeal for sponsors to help with the cost of equipment for the Games.
""We have to use specifically coloured balls for television purposes,"" she said before the event. ""We still need to get one more set which can cost between £250 and £380.""
Wilson said Wednesday's gold medal triumph with Lenton had left her lost for words.
""It is absolutely phenomenal,"" she added. ""It's been a great experience and one that I will never forget. We were confident, we believed in ourselves and we did it.""
Lenton said: ""When it mattered we did the business. We always knew we could do it."""	/sport/commonwealth-games/62410956

technology	Medical supplies drone trial takes off in Tayside	"A drone collection and delivery service transporting medical samples and equipment between health centres is being trialled in Tayside.
flight will carry equipment from the grounds of Stracathro Hospital, Brechin, to Invergowrie, near Dundee's Ninewells Hospital.
It is hoped the service could be adopted by NHS Tayside in the future to reduce transport times.
rvice is being trialled by the health board and Mercury Drone Ports.
rial route has been approved by the Federal Aviation Authority.
Future trials will carry supplies and samples between other healthcare facilities in Dundee and Angus.
Angus Council leader Beth Whiteside said she hoped the trial would demonstrate how it could help reduce testing times and speed up diagnoses for patients.
NHS Tayside said it hoped the trial would help develop and improve its supply chain, and provide an equitable level of healthcare, regardless of a patient's geographical location.
Chris Hind, the health board's diagnostics laboratories interim quality manager, said: ""NHS Tayside plans to extend phlebotomy testing hours at some regional medical practices. 
""We are very interested in testing additional logistical support to transport patient samples, which would permit samples to be taken at later times than currently possible for delivery to the main testing lab at Ninewells Hospital.""   
Mercury Drone Ports is a public-private partnership between Angus Council and drone company DTLX.
It is providing a trial airspace area to allow other drone firms and their clients to conduct test flights.
It is being funded from the UK government's £26.5m Angus Fund, as part of the Tay Cities Region Deal."	/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-63075005
entertainment	Brentwood's Stonehenge style artwork can stay, council says	"A concrete artwork resembling Stonehenge can stay for at least 18 months, a council has decided.
ructure in Brentwood, dubbed ""Unhenged"", was built by Joe McNamara as a warning about climate change.
Planning officers recommended the artwork should be deemed an inappropriate development.
But Brentwood Borough Council allowed the 53-year-old's construction to stay, giving it time to be entered for the Turner Prize art competition.
£250,000 structure is orientated so the midday sun on the winter solstice directly hits a central monolith, which features an image of Queen Elizabeth II.
It has an outer ring of 30 vertical blocks, measuring 36m (118ft) in diameter. The blocks are four metres (13ft) tall, and are bridged by 30 lintels.
re is a semi-circle within the outer circle, made of 10 shorter pillars and nine horizontal lintels.
repiece represents an hourglass and has SOS written in Morse code on the ground.
A series of LED lights on the artwork reflects a warming planet, Mr McNamara said.
""What it's about is climate change. It's Stonehenge on the outside and an hourglass in the middle,"" he said, as reported by the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
""The monolith sits on the neck of the hourglass. And that is basically telling us that time is running out in relation to climate change.""
Planning Committee member Keith Barber, Conservative, said: ""On paper, if it hadn't been built I would probably would have said no, but I have seen it and I am quite impressed by it.
His fellow Conservative councillor Keith Parker said: ""Do I like it? I don't know. Is it something special? Yes it is.
""It is something totally different and it could be something of beauty to a lot of people.""

business	Toyota cuts production due to Covid lockdown in Shanghai	"will suspend operations at more production lines at its factories in Japan this month due to the coronavirus lockdown in Shanghai.
firm says the production halt will come into effect on Monday and stay in place until of end of next week.
It is the latest big car maker to announce that it is being impacted by the Covid-19 measures in China.
Meanwhile, Tesla has reportedly halted most production at its Shanghai plant due to problems with sourcing parts.
""Due to the impact of the semiconductor shortage, we announced our revised production plan for May,"" Toyota said in a statement.
""However, as a result of the lockdown in Shanghai, China, we have decided to additionally suspend operations of 14 lines at 8 plants in Japan from May 16 (Mon) to May 21 (Sat),"" it added.
mpany previously said it planned to produce around 750,000 vehicles globally this month but said it had now cut that forecast by about 50,000 due to the lockdown.
Also on Wednesday, Toyota revealed that its quarterly profit had slumped by a third as it felt the impact of production disruptions caused by a global shortage of computer chips and China's Covid-19 restrictions.
world's biggest car maker by sales posted an operating profit of 463.8 billion yen ($3.56bn; £2.9bn) for the three months to the end of March, well below market expectations.
mpany's shares were around 4.5% lower in Wednesday afternoon trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
's announcements came as Shanghai is in its sixth week of an intensifying lockdown that has made it increasingly difficult for manufacturers to operate amid tough restrictions on the movement of people and materials.
It is the latest example of a major car maker being forced to cut back production as a result of the lockdown in Shanghai.
most of its production at its plant in the city due to problems securing parts for its electric vehicles, according to Reuters, citing an internal memo.
On Tuesday, the company planned to manufacture fewer than 200 vehicles at its factory in the city, the news agency said.
would be far below production of around 1,200 vehicles a day Tesla's Shanghai plant had seen shortly after reopening last month following a 22-day closure.
Meanwhile, the electric car maker's sales in China had already slumped by 98% in April from a month earlier, data released by the China Passenger Car Association showed.
However, during a virtual appearance at the FT Future of the Car 2022 conference on Tuesday Tesla's boss Elon Musk said China's lockdown measures would not be ""a significant issue in the coming weeks"".
