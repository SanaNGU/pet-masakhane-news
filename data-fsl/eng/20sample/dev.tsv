health	Grace Victory reunites with doctor after Covid coma cardiac arrest	"A YouTuber who went into cardiac arrest while in a coma with Covid has reunited with the doctor who saved her life.
Grace Victory, 31, from High Wycombe, was put in a coma on Boxing Day 2020, just after giving birth to her son.
Dr Viv Sathianathan was the lead consultant on shift when she went into cardiac arrest three weeks later.
Ms Victory, who is also an author, said she felt privileged returning to Northwick Park Hospital in London to give a talk with him for trainee staff.
""It was an honour to talk with Dr Viv about the good and the bad from my 98-day stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to give advice on things that could be improved upon from a patient perspective,"" she said.
""Dr Viv said my heart stopped beating whilst I was laying on my front, which is literally a worst-case scenario, but he and a team of 10 nurses and doctors brought me back to life. And because of them I am here. Alive, breathing, living, thriving.""
Dr Sathianathan, clinical lead for intensive care medicine, said: ""We are all extremely pleased that Grace has made such an impressive recovery.
""We always strive to learn and improve and it was really informative to hear Grace talk to the team about the good and the bad during her time with us.""
Ms Victory, who was in a coma for three months, said the pair also spoke about the need for better psychological support for ICU patients and staff traumatised by the pandemic. She hopes to work on this idea with the charity Mind, for which she is an ambassador.
When the vlogger woke up in March 2021, she was finally able to meet her 10-week-old son Cyprus Sevyn for the first time. 
He was born by emergency C-section on Christmas Eve 2020, when Ms Victory was seven months pregnant, because she was so sick with coronavirus. 
Doctors have been amazed by her recovery, she said, after they initially only gave her a 5% chance of survival.
Ms Victory is now pregnant with her second child, a little girl, and is due to give birth next month.
""I'm now focusing on birth prep, relaxation and spending time with my bestie Cyprus Sevyn. I feel as if a chapter is closing and a new one is beginning and I could not be more excited,"" she added.

health	South East Coast Ambulance Service issues New Year's Eve plea	"An ambulance service that covers four counties has called for support from the public ahead of New Year's Eve.
South East Coast Ambulance Service (Secamb) urged people to only call 999 for genuine emergencies.
NHS services in the South East continue to face sustained pressure, with Surrey and Sussex NHS Trust, Medway Maritime Hospital and Secamb all declaring critical incidents this month.
Demand is expected to remain high across the New Year period.
Secamb is responsible for covering Brighton & Hove, East Sussex, West Sussex, Kent, Surrey, and North East Hampshire.
Last year, the trust said it answered about 1,000 999 calls in the seven hours from 20.00 GMT on 31 December.
rating New Year's Eve are urged to plan their evenings, including how they get home, ensuring they look out for others, and, if drinking alcohol, remembering the impact excessive drinking can have on health and emergency services.
Emma Williams, Secamb executive director for operations, said: ""We have faced significant pressure on our services for many weeks but we know that New Year's Eve can bring additional challenges.""
Ms Williams wants people to celebrate ""sensibly"" and says she understands how the decisions of individuals can impact an ""already stretched ambulance service"".
""I would like to thank all our staff and volunteers for their hard work and professionalism at this busy time and urge the public to show their support by using NHS services wisely,"" she added.
ublic is asked to help Secamb manage pressure by reserving 999 for genuine emergencies and making use of alternatives such as the 111 service, when incidents are not so serious.
Meanwhile, Chief Medical Officer for NHS Kent and Medway, Dr Kate Langford, urged people to be ""very, very selective"" when using emergency services amid an ""incredibly challenging"" period due to flu and Covid.
She said using 999 or an emergency department for something not life threatening could be ""delaying the care of someone who does have a life threatening condition"".
""Anything people can do to avoid using those routes unless it really is an emergency is greatly appreciated,"" she added.

health	Ulster Hospital: Bed pressures 'worse than during Covid'	"Emergency department situation 'worse than during Covid'
urrent pressure on hospital beds is ""worse than it was during Covid"", according to a senior manager at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald.
Seaneen Pettigrew works in the hospital's discharge hub and her role is to free up beds by facilitating the discharge of medically-fit patients.
She said they were having difficulty securing care in the community for vulnerable patients leaving hospital.
Ms Pettigrew said demand for carers ""is currently outstripping supply"".
""We've more patients attending emergency department (ED), we've more patients coming through the hospital and more patients with complex needs who are needing more support on discharge than maybe previously,"" she said.
BBC News NI was granted access to the hospital's discharge hub this week, as well as its emergency department.
On Wednesday afternoon, 135 patients were in the emergency department, with 50 of those waiting for admission to a ward.
At the same time, there were 67 patients in the hospital who were ready to be discharged into the community, but could not leave because of delays securing onward care. 
One patient, who required admission to the hospital, had been waiting nearly 60 hours in the emergency department.
Seven ambulances were also waiting outside with patients onboard.
Andrew Dobbin, a consultant at the Ulster Hospital, warned that patients waiting long periods in emergency departments to be admitted are ""going to come to harm"".
He said there was ""almost a one-in-one out-policy"" due to delays discharging medically-fit patients.
Dr Dobbin said it had become normal to see 50 patients waiting in the department for admission to wards and for hospital staff to be under ""significant pressure"".
""We know, as our Royal College of Emergency Medicine has said, that crowding and long waits in emergency departments are directly linked to harm for patients and we know that patients staying here for long periods of time are going to come to harm.""
He added there were two reasons why emergency departments were facing ""significant problems"".
""The first thing is demand has increased and the second problem, which is the main problem at the moment, is that we have a significant number of patients who need to continue their care in hospital that we cannot move through our system to create the capacity to run an efficient, safe, effective emergency department.""
In the hospital's discharge hub a team of nurses, social workers, administrative staff and occupational therapists work seven days a week sourcing suitable placements for patients who are ready to leave hospital. 
Ms Pettigrew told BBC News NI that the ""picture is worse than it was during Covid"" because of the demand.
""The challenges we are having would be in accessing domiciliary care and sourcing appropriate care homes to facilitate patient discharge, and as a result those patients are delayed in hospital awaiting their care package or care home.""
Ms Pettigrew said the team at the discharge hub were appealing to patients and their families to work with them. 
""Given the challenges we may have to look at an alternative interim bed to go to, to await your package or await your home of choice.
""We know its not ideal, but it frees up the hospital bed for those patients waiting to come in through ED to also get the treatment that your loved one will have had.""
rge hub manager said there was a need to increase the number of care workers both within care homes and the domiciliary care sector. 
""It is a very complex issue within domiciliary care, the demand for the service is outstripping what's available at the minute.
""And then within our care home sector it is the appropriate care home placements for patients - potentially those who have complex nursing needs, complex behavioural needs.  It's trying to source the right placements for those patients,"" Ms Pettigrew explained. 
Separately, the number of people waiting for a first appointment with a consultant increased by 20,000 in a year, according to the latest figures from the Department of Health. 
More than 375,000 people were waiting to see a specialist at the end of September, up more than 5% from the same time last year.
Department of Health said its target by March next year is that at least 50% of people should not be waiting any longer than nine weeks for a first outpatient appointment.
urrent number of patients waiting longer than nine weeks is 82%, with over half of people on a waiting list for more than a year.
figures also show that almost 124,000 people were waiting to be admitted to hospital for inpatient or day care treatment.
And almost 164,000 patients were still waiting for a diagnostic test at the end of September - up 11% on the same time last year."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63746844
business	Octopus Energy to take over collapsed supplier Bulb	"Octopus boss Greg Jackson says the company expects a ""seamless"" switch for Bulb customers
Energy supplier Octopus Energy is to buy its smaller competitor Bulb.
Bulb collapsed last year amid rising gas and electricity prices and has since been run by the government.
Its 1.5 million customers will not see any change or disruption to energy supplies, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said.
ue of the deal has not been published but the BBC understands Octopus paid the government between £100m and £200m.
It is expected to be completed by the end of November.
Business Secretary Grant Shapps said the deal, approved by the UK government, would bring ""vital reassurance and energy security to consumers across the country at a time when they need it most"". 
government announcement on Saturday made no mention of the money involved in the deal, which was reached overnight between special administrators of Bulb and Octopus Energy.
ment said that ""due to high market volatility it is impossible"" to forecast the true cost of Bulb. 
For Bulb customers, credit balances on bills will be protected and direct debits automatically transferred.
Greg Jackson, Octopus Energy Group boss, said the company was determined to provide a ""stable home for the future"" for Bulb's customers and staff. Bulb has 650 employees.
Mr Jackson told the BBC he was confident the takeover would be smooth, saying the company had ""a great track record"" when it came to moving customers across companies. 
firm has agreed to share profits - if any are made from its new Bulb customers - with the government, for up to four years. 
Octopus said the move would bring ""an end to taxpayer losses"", adding it was ""paying the government"" to take on Bulb's customers. 
It was previously reported in July that Octopus had requested £1bn in public funding for the deal. However a source close to the company has since categorically denied this. 
London-based Bulb was the biggest of more than 30 energy companies that collapsed last November following a spike in wholesale gas prices, which was partly caused by Covid restrictions ending and has since been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. 
It was placed into ""special administration"", meaning it was run by the government through the regulator Ofgem. The special administration measure is only used if Ofgem is unable to find another company to take over an energy firm's customers. 
ut of Bulb had been forecast to cost the taxpayer around £2bn by next year. It was the biggest state bailout since the Royal Bank of Scotland collapse during the 2008 financial crisis.
Natural gas prices have doubled since last October, and despite dropping significantly from a peak in August, many families are struggling to get by as they also grapple with rising inflation, which reached 10.1% in September.  
As part of the mini-budget announced by former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng in September, the government announced an ""energy price guarantee"" - capping typical household bills at £2,500 - for two years, but Jeremy Hunt - who replaced Mr Kwarteng as chancellor earlier this month - then said the support will last until April. 
Mr Hunt is expected to make a full statement on his spending plans on 17 November. 
Every household in the UK is also getting an energy bill discount of £400 this October.
Mr Shapps, who became business secretary this week, said the deal highlighted the government's ""overriding priority"" to protect customers. He added he would do everything he could to ""ensure our energy system provides secure and affordable energy for all"". 
Octopus will continue to use Bulb's technology and branding ""for a transitionary period"", the government's statement said.
mpany, which was founded in the UK in 2015, said that before the Bulb acquisition it served 3.4 million customers.

business	Borehamwood Market set to close due to reduction in demand	"A Hertfordshire town's market will close later this year following a ""significant reduction in demand"".
Hertsmere Borough Council said Borehamwood Market would close at the end of August, when the current contract expires.
Lower footfall plus changes to online shopping habits had ""resulted in a reduction of stalls and breadth of services"", the authority said.
It added people had ""overwhelmingly"" said they no longer wanted the market. 
market takes place every Tuesday and Saturday along a service road off Shenley Road.
It has recently seen a steady decline in stallholders and customers and currently has between four and six traders operating.
Caroline Clapper, Hertsmere's portfolio holder for economic development, said the executive group's unanimous decision was ""not a cost-based"" one.
""[It is] based on evidence and consultation with residents, shopkeepers and people in the town, who overwhelming stated they do not want the market, as well as the current operator indicating they would not retender for the contract,"" she said.
""I appreciate this may be disappointing to some people, but this gives us an opportunity to have a blank slate to look at provision in Borehamwood and to make decisions on what is going to enhance our town, what is going to be fit for the future and what is the best location, because we all want our High Street to thrive.""
She added that the council remained ""committed to exploring alternative options"".
""Our aim is to rejuvenate the town centre for local people and make Borehamwood a destination town for visitors,"" she said.

technology	UK firm takes on Apple iPhone 14 and Elon Musk with satellite phone	"A British smartphone maker hopes to steal a march on Apple and Tesla boss Elon Musk with a new satellite-connected handset, the BBC has learned.
If there is no wi-fi or mobile network signal, the idea is the Bullitt phone will automatically link to one of two global satellite networks.
re is speculation that Apple's forthcoming iPhone 14 could have emergency satellite connectivity.
Mr Musk is also working on a satellite phone service with T-Mobile.  
However, last month he said plans were hampered by ""regulatory approval"" of satellite launches and added that the service would be unlikely to become available before the end of 2023.
Bullitt's service is due to launch in February 2023 and will initially enable users to send and receive text messages only. 
recipient will receive the message in the form of an SMS and can reply if they download Bullitt's app. It is free to use for them - but the Bullitt phone owner will have to pay a monthly subscription for the service. 
Reading-based firm declined to say how much it would cost but said it would be available in tiers, on a par with existing mobile tariffs and payable on top of a standard network contract. It has yet to release images of the device.
And while Apple's service is rumoured to be for emergency use only in North America, Bullitt claims its phone will automatically switch to satellite in the absence of any other signal worldwide.
""What we've got is a smartphone launching in February that will be capable of two-way messaging, via satellite, with global coverage,"" said Bullitt co-founder Richard Wharton.
""I'm hoping that we've managed to jump ahead."" 
Mr Musk says that currently phones using his platform could have to wait up to 30 minutes to connect with a satellite. However, Mr Wharton said he believed that thanks to deals with two global satellite networks - which he declined to name - the wait would not be more than a few seconds.
requires a bespoke chipset that has been developed over the last 18 months with an Asian manufacturer, he said. The battery drain would be minimised by the phone only seeking satellites in the absence of other signals, he added.
So-called ""not-spots"", where there is poor or no mobile coverage, exist all over the world, particularly in rural areas. 
""We want to work with [network operators] because there are challenges with providing cellular coverage to 100% geography of a country, so what we are offering is that infill, where there are coverage black spots,"" said Mr Wharton.
Satellite phones have traditionally been expensive with limited functionality, and satellite reception can also be disrupted by weather conditions.
""Satellite remains the next and last frontier in connectivity,"" said Paolo Pescatore, tech analyst at PP Foresight.
""It is encouraging to see providers starting to get serious about using satellite for the last mile. Ultimately reliable and robust connectivity is still highly sought-after among all users.""

entertainment	Prince Harry and Meghan say they didn't step back over privacy concerns	"WATCH: A clip from the first episode of the Harry and Meghan Netflix series
Duke and Duchess of Sussex have said they never cited privacy as a reason for stepping back from royal life.
Prince Harry and Meghan's global press secretary said a ""distorted narrative"" had been created.
It follows suggestions from some commentators that their Netflix series, which launched this week, is at odds with their reasons for leaving the UK.
ment said this was ""entirely untrue"".
It said they always intended to keep up public duties after leaving the royal family.
r decision to step back from royal life in early January 2020 was announced in two coordinated statements from the duke and duchess and Buckingham Palace.
In their statement at the time, the Sussexes said: ""We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth and our patronages.
""This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity.""
At the time, one interpretation of their decision led to commentary suggesting that press intrusion, particularly that affecting their then-newborn son Archie, may have been a factor.
uple have engaged in separate legal battles against newspaper publishers, including over privacy, since they told several of the UK's biggest tabloid titles they would no longer cooperate with them.
Press intrusion is a theme that runs throughout the first three episodes of the new Netflix documentary, Harry & Meghan, which is co-produced by the couple.
And since the release of the episodes and two minute-long trailers, some commentators cited in the media have suggested they have changed their tune on the subject of privacy.
For example, Dickie Arbiter, a former press secretary to the late Queen, told GB News after watching the first three episodes on Thursday: ""They left because they wanted privacy. 
""Well, so much for privacy in this documentary because we are seeing a lot of family photographs.""
Another critic responding to one of the trailers was quoted by a newspaper as saying: ""They've blown their own protestations out of the water and detonated their own privacy policy.""
Sussexes' global press secretary, Ashley Hansen, said in a written statement: ""The Duke and Duchess have never cited privacy as the reason for stepping back. This distorted narrative was intended to trap the couple into silence.
""In fact, their statement announcing their decision to step back mentions nothing of privacy and reiterates their desire to continue their roles and public duties. Any suggestion otherwise speaks to a key point of this series.
""They are choosing to share their story, on their terms, and yet the tabloid media has created an entirely untrue narrative that permeates press coverage and public opinion. The facts are right in front of them."""	/news/uk-63922657
politics	Richmond constituents react to Rishi Sunak becoming PM	"Rishi Sunak is set to become the next prime minister after winning the Conservative leadership contest.
No 10 said he will formally take over on Tuesday after meeting King Charles.
42-year-old former chancellor was the only contender to gain enough support from MPs to stand for the job.
BBC visited the market town of Richmond to find out how his constituents have reacted to their MP getting the top job.
One woman in the town's market square described his election as ""brilliant"".
""Apart from anything else he can do sums, which none of the others could,"" she added.
A man said that he ""would have preferred Boris"" but conceded that Mr Sunak would be ""as good as anyone else"".
A swift thumbs up and a ""he's got to be better than the last one"" was our first indication that people in Richmond were welcoming a new PM. 
Big boots, waterproofs and walking poles - no odd sight here right next to the Yorkshire Dales.
A market square where you could do a pretty hefty pub crawl without walking more than a few hundred years is even busier today. 
Half term means that families, walkers and tourists are mingling with the locals, perhaps diluting Conservative support a little in the strongest Blue seat in Yorkshire. 
king of William Hague to be his successor went a long way to securing Rishi Sunak a seat here in 2015. The new PM will be hoping to do more than the four years his mentor did at the helm of the Conservative Party.
Knocking about in the market square teenagers ask what the news satellite trucks are doing and question why Boris Johnson isn't going to be PM.
And if you're one of the many journalists about to book tickets to come up here look up the lash goshte - according to one takeaway it's Richmond's favourite food.
And whoever decided to put kebab and chips inside a calzone - well, they get my vote. 
Another woman who runs a special needs school said she had met the future PM last summer and was ""really, really happy at the news"". 
""He came to visit us at the school and I was just touched by how lovely he was with the children and the staff,"" she said.
One woman described his elevation as ""inevitable"". ""I think he will probably do a better job but I do think it's time for a general election,"" she said.

health	Weston General Hospital improves after 'inadequate' rating	"Hospital staff have been praised for helping it improve, but bosses admit there is more to be done.
Weston General Hospital has been upgraded from its ""inadequate"" rating by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).
CQC rated the hospital 'requires improvement' after an inspection in August, up from inadequate - the lowest the health regulator can give.
It found staffing was stretched, although there were sufficient numbers to keep patients safe, 
's surgical unit and identification of blood clot risks were areas where improvement was found to be needed.
Concerns were also raised about racist behaviour towards staff, highlighted as a priority to hospital leadership, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
But the report also found that staff provided good care, treated patients with kindness, and that the Weston General's leaders had the skills to run the hospital well and were making improvements.
Chief executive of the NHS trust that runs the hospital, Eugine Yafele, said: ""I absolutely want to congratulate the team at Weston on getting the hospital to be on a firm footing of recovery and improvement.""
Mr Yafele added: ""What this also highlights is there is a steely determination, because the people who have done this are people at Weston, and actually 'requires improvement' is the start.
""I think their ambitions, and the ambitions we have for patients, are to go beyond that.""
Chief Medical Officer Stuart Walker insisted: ""I think its absolutely the case that there has been a very significant improvement.
""Now, that may manifest itself - in CQC function and how they process things - as inadequate to our eye but there has been a major improvement in the quality of care being able to be offered there.""

sports	European Aquatics Championships: Spendolini-Sirieix and Toulson win second diving golds	"British divers Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix and Lois Toulson won their second gold medals of the European Championships when they teamed up in the women's synchronised 10m platform.
Competing together for the first time in Rome, they amassed 303.60 points, with their final dive securing the title for them with a score of 72.96.
A further medal was to follow on the penultimate day in Rome as Jordan Houlden won 3m springboard silver, but Jack Laugher missed out on the podium in fifth.
Laugher, a two-time Olympic and three-time world medallist in the event, scored fewer than 50 points with three of his six dives as Italy won gold and bronze.
Houlden, 24, won silver - his first individual European medal - with a total of 428.55 points, 25.30 shy of newly crowned champion Lorenzo Marsaglia.
Spendolini-Sirieix capped a memorable few weeks with a second European title as she and Toulson, 22, finished 4.74 points ahead of Ukraine's silver medallists.
Germany won bronze, with Italy missing out in a field of four pairs.
r victory came just weeks after Spendolini-Sirieix - the daughter of TV personality Fred Sirieix - won two gold medals and a silver at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.
""I'm so happy to finish the season with Lois by my side, it was a great last dive and I'm ready for summer,"" she told BBC Sport.
ulson added: ""We've been quite lucky that this was our first time together. 
""We've literally done those dives once before the competition and for it to go that well it proves to us that we are pretty good.""
For 17-year-old Spendolini-Sirieix, it marks a third medal of the Championships, having won the individual 10m title earlier in the week as well as mixed team bronze.
On Tuesday, Toulson, 22, took European gold in the mixed synchronised 10m platform event with British team-mate Kyle Kothari.
Houlden was in fourth place after round two of the men's 3m springboard before a stellar third-round effort catapulted him up the standings.
, a reverse three-and-a-half somersaults in tuck, tied for the best of the competition with a score of 84.00.
It marks the end of a breakthrough season for Houlden, in which he also won two medals at the Commonwealth Games.
""It feels absolutely mindblowing. This is probably the best year I've had so far, hopefully there is more to come,"" he told BBC Sport.
""Now I'm finished for the season so I get to rest for a bit, have a bit of time off.""
Laugher, meanwhile, led after two rounds but a third-round score of 49.30 saw him slip down.
He made amends on dive four, scoring 79.20, but it wasn't enough as further errors crept into his performance.

technology	Rogers outage: Why a network upgrade pushed millions in Canada offline	"In early July, a massive network outage at Rogers, a Canadian telecoms giant, forced more than 10 million customers - over a quarter of the country's population - off their internet or wireless services. The firm is now under intense pressure from regulators to explain what happened.
quences of the 19-hour nationwide outage ranged from the potentially dangerous, to the frustrating, to the ironic.
Police services reported that 911 services were inaccessible on many mobile phones. Hospitals reported communications problems, and one Ontario hospital had to redirect cancer patients when emergency radiation treatments were affected by the outage.  
Banking services were disrupted, and many businesses could not accept debit payments or could only take cash.
Fans of pop superstar The Weeknd - who hails from Toronto - were turned away after he was forced to cancel a hometown tour stop at the Rogers Centre (yes, the same Rogers) stadium.
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) - the regulatory body that oversees Rogers and other Canadian telecoms  - couldn't receive calls.
mpany, one of Canada's main telecoms firms, is now facing intense scrutiny from the federal government and the CRTC, which has ordered Rogers to explain in detail what caused the ""unacceptable"" shutdown.
Rogers CEO Tony Staffieri blamed the system failure on a maintenance update and has apologised to customers, offering a five days service credit as compensation.
But questions remain about how a seemingly routine process left millions without crucial access to online services - and on Friday, a Parliamentary committee said it would be studying the outage in meetings this month.
Long before the outage, expressing frustration with Canada's telecoms industry has been described as a national pastime, uniting the country much like ice hockey and the ubiquitous Tim Hortons coffee chain.
""Rogers, Bell Canada and Telus are known as the companies that you love to hate,"" said Richard Leblanc, a professor of law, governance and ethics at York University in Toronto.
firms control 90% of the country's telecoms market.
""We're essentially beholden to three companies,"" said Mr Leblanc. ""They've got so much authority and control.""
Experts say it's a symptom of Canada's strict foreign ownership rules for the industry. 
government has, for years, supported industries like the airlines and the telecoms out of fear that foreign countries might take over, said Ben Klass, a PhD candidate at Carleton University's School of Journalism and Communication. 
""As the neighbour of the United States, Canada has got a bit of a complex. We want to ensure we don't just become a branch plant of the US.""
gopoly isn't cheap - Canadians also pay some of the highest mobile phone and roaming rates in the world, according to multiple studies.
Industry analysts say Canada's rather non-competitive telecoms market has allowed its Big Three - Rogers, Bell and Telus - to face few consequences for sometimes shoddy service.
In a statement, Mr Staffieri vowed Rogers ""will make every change and investment needed to help ensure that [a similar outage] will not happen again"" and would work with the industry to ensure certain essential services would not be interrupted by technical issues.
Bell's top executive, Mirko Bibic, said last week the company takes its role in Canadians' communications networks ""very seriously"" and was investing billions in upgrades for a ""robust and resilient"" infrastructure.
And telecoms firms have argued that Canada's large land mass and sparse population make it expensive for telecoms to provide service.
But Rogers in particular has had a rough time in recent months.
July's massive outage was the second in two years.
In April 2021, the company's wireless network crashed in a similar fashion, affecting calls, text messages and data services. At the time, Rogers blamed the failure on a software update by one of its equipment suppliers.
Months later, the company was hit with a public relations crisis as the family-owned business suffered a showdown between siblings, reminiscent of HBO television show Succession.
Edward Rogers - the namesake and only son of the late family patriarch - sought to unilaterally remove then-chief executive Joe Natale, blaming him for the firm's underperformance.
But Mr Rogers was stymied by his mother, Loretta, and two sisters, who closed ranks around Mr Natale, setting the stage for a very public family feud.
ute eventually made its way to court, where a judge sided with Mr Rogers. He went on to hand-pick Mr Staffieri, who is now the current CEO, saying he was among ""the most highly regarded and seasoned"" executives in the industry.
For Rogers, the timing of this outage blunder was particularly bad, as the company is working to close a proposed C$20bn ($15bn; £13bn) takeover of competitor Shaw Communications.
Mr Staffieri said this week that Rogers remains committed to the merger.
But Rogers still needs the approval of the Competition Bureau Canada - the national antitrust authority  - and the federal government.
And the massive outage raised doubts that the relevant authorities will opt to put more power in the hands of a single company.
""It certainly won't help their cause,"" said Mr Klass.
""Just the fact that this outage occurred on such a wide scale and it would have been worse had Rogers already taken Shaw over"", with an even larger customer base knocked offline.
As Canadians saw, the country's outsized reliance on just three telecoms firms make it susceptible to sweeping network crashes.
But experts say this reliance on a few firms also makes Canada vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
""We've put all our eggs in one basket, and that's now a target for threat actors - Russia, China, Iran, North Korea,"" said York University's Mr Leblanc.
""You don't have to attack financial services, or healthcare, or emergency services, you just have to attack the telco because all these industries are contingent on these two or three players,"" he said.

Rogers has until Friday to comply with the CRTC's demand for a detailed account of last week's failure.
Many industry experts have gone one step further, calling for a public probe into how this most recent outage occurred.
""This cannot happen behind closed doors,"" said Mr Leblanc. ""It needs to be a public inquiry, where the telcos are hauled in front of elected politicians. There needs to be accountability.""
For now Mr Leblanc, a long-time Rogers customer, has done the only thing he can do: call the competition.

business	Christmas post hit as Royal Mail workers strike	"Firms have warned of the hit to Christmas sales as postal workers squeezed by rising costs fight for higher pay and better conditions.
Royal Mail workers walked out again on Wednesday, marking the third of six strike days across the festive season.
Lucy Bryant, who sells art products, uses Royal Mail for deliveries and says it's frustrating for her and customers when they don't arrive on time.
warning comes as rail workers and driving examiners walk out too.
Postal worker walkouts coincide with the busiest time of year for Royal Mail when people and businesses are sending Christmas cards and presents.
Lucy Bryant, who runs her small business Haus of Lucy from Brighton, says she supports the strikers as ""everyone has a right to fair pay"".
However, because she relies ""so heavily on the post"" to get products from suppliers and to send her art to customers, she says it ""has made my life very hard this Christmas season"".
Some artworks are getting through, and some aren't. ""There's almost no logic to what is getting through,"" she says.
Lucy had to re-order prints that didn't arrive at a cost to the business ""that is quite a big hit for me to take,"" she says.
""I'm not Banksy - yet,"" she adds.
Watch Make Sense of Strikes on iPlayer and find out more about why people are striking and whether industrial action works.
Pip Haywood, managing director of online card company Thortful, has calculated that each day of action is costing the firm up to £50,000 a day.
""It's meant we've had to staff up to protect our customers,"" she told the BBC, with three times as many requests for advice on delivery windows from shoppers than usual.
""So it's not just hitting revenue, it's adding cost and also causing brand damage.""
With the company relying on Royal Mail for about 80% of its business, she says the strikes mean the firm will miss its sales target for the year.
Some parcel companies claim the walkouts are having a knock-on effect, and forcing them to delay next-day deliveries as people and firms seek alternative ways to send their post.
DPD Group said: ""We are experiencing short delays to our next-day delivery service in a small number of locations, as a result of the industrial action at the Royal Mail, which has had a huge knock-on effect across the entire industry.""   
Evri, the delivery company formerly known as Hermes, said that severe weather, Royal Mail strikes and staff shortages are causing ""some localised delays"". 
While Yodel also said that deliveries are taking longer to some areas but did not specify why.
As well as holding strikes this week, 115,000 Royal Mail workers from the Communication Workers Union (CWU) will also take industrial action on 23 December and Christmas Eve.
ute has been going on since the summer and like all the industrial action across rail, the NHS, teachers, border staff and driving examiners, pay is a key issue.
A spokesman for Royal Mail said the company had made a ""best and final pay offer worth up to 9% over 18 months"". 
""Instead of working with us to agree on changes required to fund that offer and get pay into our posties' pockets, the CWU has announced plans to ballot in the New Year for further strike action.""
But a spokesman for the CWU said that Royal Mail has offered workers a 3% pay rise this year, 3% next year as well as an additional 2% if employees agree to ""the absolute destruction"" of terms and conditions.
union has said the strikes are partly about the ""Uberisation"" of the postal service, including ""widespread changes... introducing Uber-style owner-drivers, mail centre closures and changes to Sunday working"".
Many workers are seeking wage rises as the cost of living soars. The rate at which prices are rising, known as inflation, is running at nearly 11%, which remains close to a 40-year high.
On Tuesday, a separate set of figures from the ONS revealed that the gap between wage growth in the public and private sector is near a record high.
rage pay rise for workers in the private sector was 6.9% between August and October. That compares to wage growth of just 2.7% for public sector employees.
uesday's walkout by rail staff left services running at about a fifth of capacity, on a day when snow, ice and fog hampered road and air travel. 
Around half of rail lines are shut again on Wednesday, with no services at all in most of Scotland and Wales. 
first-ever nationwide strike by nurses is also expected to go ahead this week.
And on Friday, rail workers, buses, baggage handlers, highway workers and driving examiners will walk out.
government's emergency Cobra committee will hold its second meeting of the week later to discuss how to minimise the impact of the wave of industrial action.
Along with the rail industrial action on Tuesday and Wednesday, there will also be train strikes on Friday and Saturday.
rt of a long-running dispute between unions, rail firms, the government and Network Rail over pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions.
But the rail industry was hit by a drop-off in passenger numbers during the Covid pandemic, and it's under pressure to save money. Bosses say reforms need to be agreed, to afford pay increases and modernise the railway.
Network Rail wants to cut 1,900 jobs as part of changes to the way its maintenance teams work - although it insists most of this could be achieved by people leaving voluntarily.
RMT disagrees with some of the changes and wants a guarantee of no compulsory job losses."	/news/business-63961595

business	737 Max: Boeing to pay $200m over charges it misled investors	"Boeing is to pay out $200m (£177.5m) over charges that it misled investors about two fatal 737 Max crashes.
US stock market regulator said the aviation giant and its former chief executive Dennis Muilenburg made false statements about safety issues. 
Boeing ""put profits over people"" in an effort to rehabilitate its image, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
737 Max was grounded for 20 months after two crashes killed 346 people.
As part of the settlement Mr Muilenburg will also pay a penalty of $1m.
""In times of crisis and tragedy, it is especially important that public companies and executives provide full, fair, and truthful disclosures to the markets,"" SEC chairman Gary Gensler said in a statement.
Boeing and Mr Muilenburg ""failed in this most basic obligation,"" he added.
SEC's statement also said that both Boeing and Mr Muilenburg did not admit or deny the regulator's findings.
""We will never forget those lost on Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, and we have made broad and deep changes across our company in response to those accidents,"" Boeing said in response to the SEC's announcement.
""Fundamental changes that have strengthened our safety processes and oversight of safety issues, and have enhanced our culture of safety, quality, and transparency,"" the company added.
SEC said a fund will be established for investors who suffered losses due to the misleading information between 2018 and 2019.
ment is largely symbolic. The 737 Max scandal has already cost Boeing tens of billions - another $200m will barely register.
But it does give the SEC the chance to call out Boeing and its ex-chief executive Dennis Muilenburg for making assurances about the plane's safety, when they already knew it had a serious problem - thereby misleading investors.
It's unlikely this will cause Boeing any meaningful harm. Its corporate reputation had already been severely damaged by the affair. The company is now working hard to restore it, and regain public and investor confidence.
For Mr Muilenberg himself, the financial consequences of the settlement won't be that painful either. He received some $60m in compensation and benefits when he left the company. But the fact that the SEC chose to charge him personally sends out a powerful signal.
re have been criticisms in some quarters that the ex-boss has not been properly held to account for his role in the affair. On this occasion, though, the finger has been pointed squarely in his direction.
On 29 October 2018, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed into the Java Sea 13 minutes after taking off from Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, killing all 189 passengers and crew.
Less than five months later, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, another Boeing 737 Max on its way to Kenya, crashed six minutes after leaving Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa. All 157 people on board were killed.
rashes were linked to a flight control system called the ""Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System"" (MCAS) in the Boeing 737 Max.
SEC said that ""after the first crash, Boeing and Mr Muilenburg knew that MCAS posed an ongoing airplane safety issue, but assured the public that the 737 Max was safe to fly.
rashes have cost Boeing more than $20bn, including payments to families of those killed in the crashes.
In the wake of the incidents, the US Congress passed new legislation reforming how the country's aviation regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), certifies new planes. 
A small number of trials are expected to start next year to resolve outstanding claims.

business	City fears Kwarteng's tax cuts may be anti-growth	"City insiders have warned that tax cuts designed to stimulate economic growth might have the opposite effect.
Bankers, bond traders and economists the BBC talked to cast doubt on the government policy that was announced on Friday.
Chancellor and Prime Minister's guiding star has been that if you put more money in the pockets of consumers and companies the economy should grow.
x cuts should therefore produce stronger economic growth.
However, the opposite might be true in this case, with the tax cuts making economic growth harder to achieve, the City of London insiders said.
unexpectedly large £45bn cut to existing and proposed tax rates has put even more pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates faster than was previously contemplated.
Markets were expecting baseline interest rates set by the Bank to rise from 2.25% now to 4% next year. Since Friday's not-so-mini-budget, the bank rate is now expected to hit nearly 6% in May of next year.  
Companies don't get to borrow at that rate, they pay extra on top, for the perceived risk they won't be able to pay it back.
For example, Marks and Spencer would have to pay 10% or more if it was to borrow for 5 years in the market today.  
Very few companies are going to borrow to invest in their business - build a factory, hire more people, expand research and development - at rates that high.  
In fact, they are likely to try and reduce the debt they already have by not renewing loans as they come to the end of their term - reducing their spending and investment power. 
As one bond trader put it: ""The additional risk now associated with the UK specifically means UK companies will be charged an extra premium for their borrowing compared to last week, which runs counter to the government's growth agenda."" 
It may be that the markets will settle down, take a closer look at the government's other reforms and cuts to regulation promised in the coming weeks and months, and decide the government's plan for growth can work. 
But, as things stand, the UK and the companies that call it home have lost some credibility in the eyes of lenders.
reases borrowing costs by a margin that more than offsets the potential boost to the incomes of consumers and businesses of cuts to current income and proposed corporation tax rates.  
""Two steps forward - three steps back"" said another bond expert. No wonder they are sometime called bond vigilantes.

technology	NHS IT supplier held to ransom by hackers	"A cyber-attack on a major IT provider of the NHS has been confirmed as a ransomware attack.
Advanced, which provides digital services like patient check-in and NHS 111, says it may take three to four weeks to fully recover.
Ransomware hackers take control of IT systems, steal data and demand a payment from victims to recover.
NHS insists that disruption is minimal, but Advanced would not say whether NHS data had been stolen.
Birmingham-based firm says it first spotted the hack at 07:00 BST on 4 August and immediately took steps to contain the hackers. It is now working to restore services.
mpany refused to say if it was in negotiations with hackers or paying a ransom to them. 
In a statement, it said: ""We are rebuilding and restoring impacted systems in a separate and secure environment.""
Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work?
An NHS England spokesperson said: ""While Advanced has confirmed that the incident impacting their software is ransomware, the NHS has tried and tested contingency plans in place including robust defences to protect our own networks, as we work with the National Cyber Security Centre to fully understand the impact. 
""The public should continue to use NHS services as normal, including NHS 111 for those who are unwell, although some people will face longer waits than usual.
""As ever, if it is an emergency, please call 999.""
An NHS psychiatrist, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC the attack left his team ""making clinical decisions nearly blind"".
""If a new patient came to us, we weren't able to read their history or know very much about them,"" he said.
""The [local] trust are doing their best at setting up an alternative system, they've got a way that we can look at some historical notes now, and have set up another system to mean that we can input new notes.
""But there's still basically a week's worth of notes that we can't access. We've been told to be ready for it to not be up and running for who knows how long.""
At the end of last week, family doctors in London were warned by NHS England they could see an increased number of patients sent to them by NHS 111 because of the ""significant technical issue"", industry magazine Pulse reported.
Advanced initially said that only a ""small number of servers"" had been affected and that it might be able to recover in a week.
Products which have been affected include Adastra, which is used by NHS 111 service, and Caresys and Carenotes, which provide the backbone for care home services like patient notes and visitor booking. 
National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ, says it is working with Advanced to help it recover.
A spokesman said: ""Ransomware is the key cyber-threat facing the UK, and all organisations should take immediate steps to limit risk by following our advice on how to put in place robust defences to protect their networks.""
Ransomware hackers are usually financially motivated and part of large, professionally run criminal gangs that target companies and demand hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions, of pounds in ransom in the form of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
While it is hard to trace where the gangs are based, analysis suggests that 74% of all money made through ransomware attacks in 2021 went to Russia-linked hackers."	/news/technology-62506039
technology	UK decides AI still cannot patent inventions	"UK's Intellectual Property Office has decided artificial-intelligence systems cannot patent inventions for the time being.
Patents assign the ownership of a new invention to its creator.
A recent IPO consultation found many experts doubted AI was currently able to invent without human assistance.
Current law allowed humans to patent inventions made with AI assistance, the government said, despite ""misperceptions"" this was not the case.
Last year, the Court of Appeal ruled against Stephen Thaler, who had said his Dabus AI system should be recognised as the inventor in two patent applications, for:
judges sided, by a two-to-one majority, with the IPO, which had told him to list a real person as the inventor.
""Only a person can have rights - a machine cannot,"" wrote Lady Justice Laing in her judgement. 
""A patent is a statutory right and it can only be granted to a person.""
But the IPO also said it would ""need to understand how our IP system should protect AI-devised inventions in the future"" and committed to advancing international discussions, with a view to keeping the UK competitive.
In July 2021, in a case also brought by Mr Thaler, an Australian court decided AI systems could be recognised as inventors for patent purposes. 
Days earlier, South Africa had issued a similar ruling. 
However, the Australian decision was later overturned on appeal.
Many AI systems are trained on large amounts of data copied from the internet.
And, on Tuesday, the IPO also announced plans to change copyright law to allow anyone with lawful access - rather than only those conducting non-commercial research, as now - to do this, to ""promote the use of AI technology, and wider 'data mining' techniques, for the public good"".
Rights holders will still be able to control and charge for access to their works but no longer charge extra for the ability to mine them.
An increasing number of people are using AI tools such as DALL.E 2 to create images resembling a work of human art.
And Mr Thaler has recently sued the US Copyright Office over its refusal to recognise a software system as the ""author"" of an image, the Register reported.
In the consultation, the IPO noted the UK was one of only a handful of countries to protect computer-generated works with no human creator. 
""author"" of a ""computer-generated work"" is defined as ""the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are undertaken"", it says. 
And protection lasts for 50 years from when the work is made.
Performing-arts workers' union Equity had called for copyright law to be changed to protect actors' livelihoods from AI content such as ""deepfakes"", generated from images of their face or voice.
IPO took this issue seriously, it said, but ""at this stage, the impacts of AI technologies on performers remain unclear"".
""We will keep these issues under review,"" it added."	/news/technology-61896180

politics	Climate change: State-owned wind farm 'could cut bills'	"Plans for a publicly owned energy company could see bills reduced and renewable supplies directly benefit communities, a minister has said. 
roposal is for a joint venture between the Welsh government and developers.
Profits would be used to construct wind turbine sites owned by communities.  
Climate Change Minister Julie James says ""it sticks in my craw"" that foreign governments get profits from wind farms in Wales. 
Ms James said communities would benefit from either owning turbines, getting homes fitted to save energy or from lower bills .  
""This will be a company that brings more of the profits back to the people of Wales directly, in the form of a state developer, but we will have to do that in a joint venture partnership with a range of other providers,"" she said.
At the moment, many big wind farms across Wales are foreign-owned, in some cases by other governments, with profits helping to fund their public services. 
ggest wind farm in Wales and England is at the heads of five valleys across south Wales.
Pen y Cymoedd, owned by Vattenfall, has 76 turbines that generate enough electricity for nearly 190,000 homes - one sixth of homes in Wales. 
generate profits for the Swedish state, which owns Vattenfall, with profits going towards heating Swedish hospitals, schools and other public services.
Rahel Jones, from Vattenfall, said the company has spent £300m in Wales in the past eight years and was not put off by the Welsh government's plans.
""Competition is good,"" she said.
""We can all work together to deliver the energy system we need and tackle climate change.""
A new wind farm is being developed between Port Talbot and Maesteg by the Irish government, owned by ESB and Coriolis, generating enough electricity for 100,000 homes. 
Gwynt y Môr, the offshore wind farm in north Wales, is owned by RWE, based in Germany. It has also taken over Innogy Renewables which built Wales' third largest wind farm near Brechfa, where there are 28 turbines. 
Ms James said: ""In the previous industrial revolution in Wales, the wealth of Wales were worked by its people, the profits were exported away. We need to make sure that doesn't happen again.""
Under its proposals, the Welsh government would help a developer with access to land, planning process, infrastructure and negotiations with the National Grid. 
r would bring in funding or venture capital - the money needed to get the project going, with the aim of having its investment returned when it makes profit. 
re would be a package so that the community benefited directly, and profits would be shared, with the Welsh government using its share for another project.
However, Ms James added that ""each joint venture will be developed differently, each site will have a different set of criteria"".
While there are existing community energy projects, the Welsh government said its proposals would include more community benefit and involvement.
""Some of the turbines will be directly owned by the community,"" said Ms James. 
She also wants ""off-grid"" communities who do not have oil or mains gas to get power directly from the turbines, if possible, making it cheaper, or energy efficiency improvements made to homes. 
Dyfan Lewis from Community Energy Wales wants decisions about how the money is spent to be decided at a local level.  
He said: ""We want to see the money go to community initiatives, funding different social businesses or helping people in fuel poverty. They have the choice then of where to use that money and how to do it best""
Communities have been getting money from wind farms already - for people living near Pen y Cymoedd, there is an annual fund of £1.8m they can bid into. 
Our Space, or Ein Lle Ni in Welsh, has had £81,500.  
Sylvia Strand and Jonathan Gregory, film and television music composers from Treherbert, Rhondda Cynon Taf, are working with people to record their stories. 
Ms Strand said the project was a way for ""the people of this area to tell the history of this area, from the ice age to the present day, in their own words"".

Having completed urgent repairs, the council has secured £1.15m for major improvements and is due to sign a deal with a group of artists, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
roject is due to be completed by January 2024.
Previous plans to convert it into flats were refused planning permission with the council hoping it could become a ""cultural hub"". 
A council cabinet report said it had been marketed in the hope of appealing to a community group with an ""established artist"" coming forward with a plan which would include creating up to 13 studio spaces.
It said: ""The aim is to adapt the building to accommodate the artist group, who will use the building as their studios, gallery and workshop space.
""A programme of community art exhibitions and events will develop as needs and partners are identified.""
w investment has been provided by the Tees Valley Combined Authority's Indigenous Growth Fund.
Phase one will create studio space on the ground and first floor, a kitchen, staff office and toilets, while printing presses and two small kilns are also being accommodated for.
A proposed second phase would create a mezzanine level but that would require further funding sought by the artists' group.
An unusual external pulpit which previously came away from the church's stonework is also set to be reinstated as part of the overhaul.

In the past 12 months West Midlands Police has received 777 reports from residents in Walsall.
Walsall Council says the technology could help police gather evidence to track offenders and seize their motorbikes.
""These are deadly machines in the wrong hands,"" said Paul Gordon, the council's director of resilient communities.
Mr Gordon added the problem with off-road bikes spanned the borough but there were ""corridors of activity where we would want to take targeted action"", according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
""We're gathering lots of data and we're starting to get the evidence together to be able to deal with this in a proactive way. The message from ourselves is 'we're coming to get you and your bikes',"" he said.
Ch Supt Phil Dolby, of Walsall police, said the West Midlands force did have use of drone technology but this was shared across the area, with demand high.
""Off-road bikes and the way they are being ridden at the moment is totally unacceptable, frustrating and very dangerous,""said Ch Supt Dolby. ""What's quite tricky for us is a tactical response that doesn't lead to injuries to the public, these people or my officers either being injured or in court.""
Police were ""coming around to"" the use of drone footage to track offenders, confiscate and crush vehicles, he added.
Walsall Council figures reveal a further 57 complaints of anti-social biking to its community protection team in the past 12 months.
Councillor Garry Perry, deputy leader for resilient communities, said he had also received more than 100 reports, largely of noise nuisance and intimidation, from residents in the Pelsall area.
""You have those who just have [bikes] for recreational use but you have another type who use those vehicles on the road without helmets and often with their faces covered,"" he said.

sports	England-Wales World Cup bid could 'transform' hockey	"An ambitious plan for England and Wales to host the biggest hockey World Cup yet could help transform the sport, according to Wales captain Rupert Shipperley.
wo nations have submitted a joint bid to host the men's World Cup in 2026 across four venues - with the final matches being played at Tottenham Hotspur's 62,000-seater stadium.
revious men's World Cup held in the UK was in London back in 1986.
International Hockey Federation (FIH) will announce the host, or hosts, in November - with Germany and South Africa among the rival bidders.
""It's a bit nerve-wracking to think we could be playing in front of 62,000 people,"" Shipperley told BBC Sport Wales at an event at the Tottenham stadium.
""This is the biggest stadium I've ever been to - as player but also as a fan of any sport. So it'd be massive for the sport and a new experience for hockey.
""If you'd had said ten years ago I'd be stood here saying potentially in a couple of years we could be playing on this pitch, I'd have laughed at you. There's a real opportunity to transform the game of hockey on the international stage.""
matches of the 16-team event will be played at Cardiff Arms Park, Twickenham Stoop in London and Franklin's Gardens in Northampton.
It would be the first time Wales has hosted World Cup fixtures. Its national sides have only been to one World Cup before - the women's event in Malaysia in 1983.
men's side have qualified for their first World Cup in India in January.

""We've had quite a journey over the last eight years. Now qualifying for the World Cup in January and hopefully going to the next one [in 2026], it's nice to see the recognition of us and a federation.

England Hockey chief executive Nick Pink said the bid team wanted to go 'bold' with the event.
""It's about putting hockey into new environments,"" he said.
""It'd be absolutely incredible to have 62,000 people watching here [in Tottenham]. It's about that transformation and pushing the sport into a different realm.
""But the second part is the legacy and the social impact. We always wanted this to be a project that took the sport right across the UK.
""Taking it right into the heart of a major city like Cardiff is just fantastic for us. It's about getting Welsh fans and Welsh communities excited about the sport of hockey. They see it in rugby and other major sports - but they've not seen hockey in that space before.
""That for me is the drive to try to engage new communities, new audiences and sustain our sport for future generations."""	/sport/hockey/62987093

technology	Olly Stephens: Social media links to violence investigated	"Links between harmful social media content seen by children and serious violence have been underestimated, a report has found.
Criminal justice consultancy Crest Advisory has called for a safety rating system to limit children's access to social media content.
Its researchers worked with the parents of Olly Stephens who was murdered in Reading, Berkshire, last year. 
His father said he had been ""groomed, abused and murdered via social media"".
Olly's family have campaigned for stricter online laws to stop harmful content being shared after it transpired the attack on him was planned on 11 social media platforms.
A girl lured 13-year-old Olly out of his house, while the boys who murdered him waited in fields near his home to attack. Two boys, aged 14, were found guilty of his murder. 
report, entitled Fixing Neverland and funded by charity The Dawes Trust, found that young people are routinely exposed to videos of violent acts and adverts for weapons.
It said the technology sector and government organisations have had a ""collective blindspot"" about the relationship between social media and serious youth violence.
It concluded that social media can ""amplify"" conflict and ""accelerate"" its route towards violence. 
Olly's mother, Amanda Stephens, said the government should consider the report's findings for the stalled Online Safety Bill.
""Our children live in an online world that means danger is close, it's under your roof, it can attack them 24 hours a day, there is no respite from its harm.
""Social media companies must be held accountable for the safety of children using their apps,"" she said.
His father, Stuart Stephens, said: ""There's also an anger that these companies are getting away with it. They don't care.""
Key recommendations also included better education about social media as well as standardised age verification controls to make it much harder for children to view harmful material.
It called for a ""five star"" rating scale for social media platforms to indicate how safe they are for children, compiled by the communications watchdog, Ofcom.
Joe Caluori, Crest Advisory's head of research and policy, said children were spending increasing amounts of time in ""unregulated, unsupervised online spaces"".
""Our research shows that parents of primary school aged children are unprepared for the risks their children face online, including petty spats which are allowed to escalate quickly, resulting serious violence which causes life changing injuries and even death, as in the tragic case of Olly Stephens.""

health	Gloucester: NHS boss says people have died waiting for ambulances	"An NHS boss has said people have died while waiting in the community for an ambulance.
Delays in paramedics reaching patients is partly due to handover delays at hospitals, an ambulance trust said.
Chief executive of Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Deborah Lee, said a decision had been made to ""bring the queue indoors"".
Some patients are being treated in corridors at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital to reduce handover delays.
Ms Lee said this was an extreme measure for extreme circumstances.
She told Gloucestershire's Health Overview Scrutiny Committee that it was safe to do this, but admitted it was not ""high quality care"" as ""nobody wants to be cared for in that setting"".
Ms Lee also admitted the situation was not sustainable but said handover times had improved and 90% were under an hour.
South Western Ambulance Service said it was working hard to reduce delays and working closely with partners to prevent them.
During the meeting at Shire Hall in Gloucester on Tuesday, councillors heard recruitment was a problem for Gloucester Royal Hospital.
Ms Lee said the NHS trust employed around 9,000 people but had a vacancy rate of 10%.
She said the trust had not given up on the ""goal of being fully recruited"" - but described urgent emergency care as the ""Achilles' heel"".
Gloucestershire's Police and Crime Commissioner Chris Nelson was at the meeting.
Mr Nelson said police officers were ""too often called out and then trapped"" at hospitals.
Det Supt Steve Bean said he had no problem helping the health service as a ""safety net"" - but said officers had been driving people to hospitals ""for months"".
Ms Lee said part of the problem at A&E was the number of patients ready to be discharged, blocking beds for new arrivals.
She said the Gloucester hospital had an average of 230 patients pending discharge.

entertainment	Love Island: Maya Jama to replace Laura Whitmore as host	"Maya Jama has been announced as the new host of ITV2's dating show Love Island.
Bafta-winning show will return to South Africa for a ninth season in 2023, with the English TV personality and ""Love Island fan"" at the helm.
Jama recently co-presented BBC One's Peter Crouch: Save Our Summer, as well as the BBC Three show Glow Up: Britain's Next Make-Up Star.
She will replace Laura Whitmore, who in turn succeeded the late Caroline Flack - the original Love Island anchor.
Whitmore fronted the show and its spin-off series Aftersun from 2020 to 2022, following the death of Flack, but announced in August she was to step down.
Paul Mortimer, ITV's director of reality programming said on Wednesday that finding someone to follow the ""wonderful"" Whitmore ""was never going to be easy"".
""In Maya Jama though, we have another high profile fan of the show who'll be a great addition to the Love Island family,"" he stated.
""Cool, charming and charismatic, I speak for us all when I say Maya will also bring a unique presenting style to the show, as did Laura and, of course, the very much missed Caroline Flack. We're very pleased to have her on board.""
Former Radio 1 DJ Jama began her broadcasting career co-hosting Trending Live on 4Music and Cannonball on ITV, before going on to co-present the Mobo Awards.
28-year-old, who has also appeared as a guest on the aforementioned Aftersun as well as RuPaul's Drag Race UK and The Big Fat Quiz of the Year, shared the news herself in a video posted to her 2.4 million Instagram followers.
""I've always been such a massive Love Island fan and I'm so excited to be hosting one of the nation's favourite shows!"" she said in a separate statement given to the press.

health	John Radcliffe Hospital: Patients using A&E hits record high	"umber of people being treated or waiting for treatment at a major hospital's A&E department has hit a record high. 
Lily O'Connor, Oxfordshire's urgent care director, said 157 patients were in the John Radcliffe Hospital's emergency department in Oxford on Monday evening. 
She said despite the ""unprecedented"" demand staff had coped well.
But they were working under ""persistent pressure"", she added. 
While she said demand ""fluctuates"" at the county's other hospital, the Horton General in Banbury, staff at the A&E there have regularly been placed ""under significant pressure"" over recent months. 
John Radcliffe has been ""under significant pressure since August"" across all ages, and demand for children's services has got ""particularly bad"" over recent weeks.   
""When we hit 100 [patients] it's pretty tough on everybody because we have got a large volume of people to see at a single point in time and [are] trying to ensure that everyone who needs immediate care gets it. 
""To get 157 in the early evening [on Monday] was unprecedented at the John Radcliffe,"" Ms O'Connor told BBC Radio Oxford.
Care Quality Commission said last month that the health and care system across England is gridlocked because patients cannot access the support they need. 
Its annual report said the problem was resulting in long waits for ambulances and in A&E departments. 
Pete Macgrane, Oxford Health's clinical director for community services, said that trust is also seeing increased demand. 
""Everything that we are doing is trying to make sure that we can support patients where at all possible and where it's clinically the right thing to do to remain within their own homes,"" he said.

business	Hundreds of jobs at risk at Billingham's Mitsubishi chemical plant	"More than 200 jobs are at risk after a chemical company announced plans to end production on Teesside.
Mitsubishi Chemical UK said it had begun a consultation with workers at its plant in Billingham.
It added ""rapidly escalating"" gas prices, a downturn in the European economy caused by inflation and weaker demand meant UK manufacturing was no longer viable.
A final decision is expected to be made in January.
firm said production of methacrylates, which are used in acrylic products and require large quantities of gas, initially stopped in January as part of a planned overhaul and had remained halted since September because of worsening economic factors.
In a statement, it said it had explored options included a temporary mothballing of the site but had concluded it was not viable.
Malcolm Kidd, vice-president of the firm's methacrylates business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, described it as a ""very sad day for everyone associated with our business on Teesside"".
""Our employees and various partners have worked tirelessly and creatively to support the business in delivering high-quality products safely and sustainably over decades but our position now and looking ahead appears simply unsustainable.
""Every effort will now go into supporting our skilled and talented production technicians, and engineering, technical and business support staff during this difficult period.""
Alex Cunningham, the Labour MP for Stockton North, said the announcement was a ""blow to both the local area and the 238 people and their families who will be directly affected"". 
He called for the government to announce a long-term strategy to combat high energy prices and told BBC Radio Tees: ""The company has been working hard to try to preserve these jobs but I really fear they may be going. The energy costs in this country are crippling industry. 
""What's going to happen further down the line - are other organisations her going to be similarly affected and stop production? We've already seen CF Fertilisers stop making ammonia and instead import it from America.
""I really fear what the knock-on effect could be.""

technology	What is behind the big tech companies' job cuts?	"first sign of job cuts at Amazon came from LinkedIn posts from laid-off employees.
, Amazon's devices boss, Dave Limp, announced: ""It pains me... We will lose talented Amazonians from the devices & services org"".
Across the tech industry, at firms like Twitter, Meta, Coinbase and Snap, workers have announced they are ""seeking new opportunities"".
Worldwide, more than 120,000 jobs have been lost, according to the Layoffs.fyi website, which tracks tech job cuts.
Different firms cut employees for different reasons but there are common themes.
As our lives moved online during the pandemic, the tech giants' businesses boomed, and executives believed the good times - for them - would continue to roll.
Meta, for example, took on more than 15,000 people in the first nine months of this year.
Now executives announcing cuts have said they miscalculated.
""I made the decision to significantly increase our investments,"" chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees, as he laid off 13% of them.
""Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.""
Online adverts are the chief source of income for many tech firms, but for the advertising business, dark clouds have been gathering. Firms have faced growing opposition to intrusive advertising practices. For example, Apple made it harder to track people's online activity and sell that data to advertisers. 
And as the economy ran into trouble, many firms slashed their online advertising budgets.
In the financial technology sector, rising interest rates have also hit companies.
""It's been a really a disappointing quarter of earnings for many of the big tech companies,"" said technology analyst Paolo Pescatore of PP Foresight. ""No-one's immune.""
Even Apple has signalled caution, with chief executive Tim Cook saying the firm was ""still hiring"", but only on a ""deliberate basis."" 
Amazon attributed its job cuts to an ""unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment"" forcing it to prioritize on what mattered most to customers.
""As part of our annual operating planning review process, we always look at each of our businesses and what we believe we should change,"" spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. 
""As we've gone through this, given the current macro-economic environment (as well as several years of rapid hiring), some teams are making adjustments, which in some cases means certain roles are no longer necessary. We don't take these decisions lightly, and we are working to support any employees who may be affected.""
Investors have also piled on the pressure to cut costs, accusing firms of being bloated and slow to respond to signs of slowdown.
In an open letter to Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, activist investor Sir Christopher Hohn urged the firm to slash jobs and pay.
Alphabet had to be more disciplined about costs, he wrote, and cut losses from projects like its self-driving car company, Waymo.
Elon Musk is certainly of the view that there is room to cut costs at his latest investment, Twitter, which has struggled to either turn a profit or attract new users.
Added to that, many commentators argue Mr Musk paid over the odds for the firm, and the pressure is on to make his investment worthwhile.
He laid off half the firm's employees; and for those who remain an ""extreme"" work ethic is promised.
According to US media reports on Tuesday, Mr Musk told staff they needed to commit to a ""hardcore"" culture of ""long hours at high intensity"" or leave. 
Industry watcher Scott Kessler also says there is less tolerance for big spending on high-tech gambles like virtual reality or driverless cars that may not pay off in the short term.
Investors also see the high wages and cushy perks some enjoy in the industry as unsustainable.
""Some companies have had to face harsh realities,"" he said.
Mike Morini, from WorkForce Software, which provides digital management tools said it appeared to be a turning point.
""The tech industry is exiting a period of growth at all costs,"" he said.
But while the big tech firms may be buffeted by economic headwinds, they are not broken.
Amazon's proposed 10,000 job cuts in corporate and technology roles - its biggest such reduction to date - represents only 3% of its office staff.
And the lay-offs may also be the start of new businesses as talented staff, dumped by the big firms, join or create start-ups.

match David Murdoch's feat from 14 years ago, his rink will have to beat a Swiss team that inflicted the Scots' only round-robin stage defeat.
Win and Mouat will be champion for a third time in four years come Saturday.
""We are definitely looking for a bit of revenge after that round-robin game,"" Mouat tells BBC Scotland.
""That is always really nice to hear that you have that chance to get yourself into the history books. 
""To get to do it for the first time in 2018, it meant a lot. To win that event was crazy, so now, four years later, in 2022, going for a third title, it is a pinch myself moment, because it is a bit surreal."" 
Mouat's rink beat Italy 7-4 in Ostersund on Thursday, while the Yannick Schwaller's Swiss followed that on Friday with a 6-3 victory over the Swedish hosts, this time led by Oskar Eriksson instead of world and Olympic champion Niklas Edin.
28-year-old Scot points out that, although the Swiss rink is new this season, they topped the round-robin, during which they eased to a 7-2 win over the reigning champions.
""They are a very good opposition,"" Mouat says. ""They have been very well-established individual curlers and they have become a very strong team this year and won a lot of events over in Canada.
""It is going to be a tough game, but we know that we can beat them.""
Mouat and team-mates Grant Hardie, Bobby Lammie and Hammy McMillan survived a tight last-four encounter against Joel Retonraz's Italian rink, who are the only side to beat the Swiss and who were unbeaten until losing to the Scots. 
Scotland had inched into a 3-1 lead only for the Italians to level with a double at the seventh end, but scoring four at the next gave Olympic and World silver medallist Mouat a match-winning lead.
Italy would later beat Sweden 10-7 in the bronze medal match.
Finishing in the top eight in the round robin had already qualified those sides for next year's World Curling Championships."	/sport/winter-sports/63747914
politics	Fox hunting: Fresh demands to toughen laws ahead of hundreds of meets	"re are fresh calls to strengthen the ban around fox hunting ahead of more than 200 meets on Boxing Day.
Countryside Alliance says it is the first time in three years traditional meets will go ahead in full.
Using dogs to chase or kill foxes was made illegal in England and Wales in 2004 in the Hunting Act.
Labour has called for stricter laws around fox hunting after it claimed there have been less than 450 convictions in over a decade.
Official figures compiled by Labour show 438 convictions - including 42 last year - were secured since 2010 under the Hunting Act.
Labour wants to close ""loopholes"" in the law and says trail hunting - which involves laying a scent for hounds to chase instead of a live animal - is being used as a ""smokescreen"" for the illegal hunting of foxes.
Countryside Alliance, which campaigns for the return of fox hunting, accused Labour of harbouring a ""pointless political vendetta against hunting"".
Chairman Nick Herbert said: ""Labour's position is utterly illogical and the large number of prosecutions under the Hunting Act only shows that the legislation is perfectly effective.""
Reacting to Labour's figures a government spokesman said: ""The Hunting Act 2004 makes it an offence to hunt a wild mammal with dogs and anyone who believes that an offence has taken place should report the matter to the police.
""Those found guilty under the Act are subject to the full force of the law."""	/news/uk-64092254
health	Urology inquiry: O'Brien triage failures 'led to 24 red-flag referrals'	"Failure to triage almost 800 urology referrals in the Southern Health Trust led to 24 patients being upgraded to red flag referrals, an inquiry has heard.   
It emerged during the third day of a public inquiry into work of consultant urologist Aidan O'Brien at the trust.
A further five people received a late cancer diagnosis due to the failures.
Mr O'Brien previously claimed the trust provided an ""unsafe"" service and was trying to shift blame on to its medics.
former urologist told an investigation that between 2015 and 2016 he ""didn't have the time to triage"" and that he was ""surprised that the number of cases upgraded was so small"". 
quiry also heard that Mr O'Brien's private patients were given ""advantageous"" treatment over health service patients. 
On Thursday, the barrister representing the trust said it apologised ""sincerely, unequivocally and publicly"" to affected patients and their families, the public as well as health staff who ""work beyond the call of duty"" every day.
""The trust wishes to state in respect of any cases where harm has occurred that ought to have been avoided, its clear commitment to meeting any resultant claims,"" he said.
Dr Neda Chada, who was appointed by the trust to conduct an investigation into the consultant's work, found that 11 private patients under Mr O'Brien's care had completed their procedures within ""much shorter timeframes"" than expected for NHS patients given their clinical priority.
Another doctor, who carried out an additional review, also found there was ""no clinical justification"" to support nine out of the 11 patients' treatment within such a short time frame.
quiry heard that Mr O'Brien disputed the treatment dates and rejected the suggestion that he had been ""improperly advantaging private patients"".
But after reviewing the notes, Dr Chada concluded all nine private patients had ""each been scheduled earlier than their clinical needs dictated"".
She also concluded Mr O'Brien had afforded them advantages over health service patients with the same clinical priority. 
On Thursday afternoon, Gerard Boyle KC, counsel for Mr O'Brien, said the inquiry should consider why the urology service had been so seriously under-resourced for decades and why the trust did not obtain and supply additional support.
He asked if anything had improved since Mr O'Brien left the employment of the Southern Trust.
""If improvements have now been made, why did that not happen sooner, many, many, many years ago?"" he added.
""Mr O'Brien, as you know, has attended each day of the patient hearings to listen to the accounts that the patients and their families have given in relation to the circumstances that you are considering.
""His focus throughout his entire professional life has been to do his best for all of his patients, notwithstanding the circumstances.
""He fully and frankly acknowledges the difficulties and the concerns that have been raised in the context of the investigation so far and this inquiry.""
Earlier, counsel for the inquiry, Martin Wolfe KC, said the trust's investigation also found that the storage of 307 sets of patient notes at the consultant's home was ""excessive and outside normal acceptable practice"".
Mr Wolfe added it constituted a ""serious data protection information governance risk"" for the trust.
Mr O'Brien had told the investigation that the trust had ""not developed a system for either tracking notes or had they sought to determine the extent of the problem prior to the investigation"". 
quiry also heard of a catalogue of problems including undictated clinic notes dating back to November 2014 which affected 668 patients.  
A review look back took six months to complete. 
re had been ""multiple attendances"" without reciprocal letters on patient's files, delays in sending letters to patients and cases in which no entries had been made on patients' charts.  
Additionally, Mr Wolfe said that the inquiry may have to consider along various lines which senior managers within the trust knew what and when.  
In her investigation, Dr Chada found that there were ""earlier opportunities"" where those within the health trust could have added concern about Mr O'Brien's work prior to 2016.
rtunities were not taken in a consistent, planned or robust manner, she added.
On Wednesday, the inquiry heard that Mr O'Brien had left a 6.5cm swab in a patient after surgery and failed to identify it in a scan three months later.
It was also told that almost 600 patients received ""suboptimal care"" from Mr O'Brien's clinical practice."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63582741

One fan said she felt ""mugged off"" by the cancellation.
N-Dubz apologised but said singer Dappy had been advised by doctors to rest and would be unable to perform.
Hours before the show, Dappy posted on his Instagram story that his voice was ""basically gone"" as a result of doing ""too many shows back to back"".

Katie Simpson, 21, from Nottingham, said she felt ""mugged off"" by the group, adding the atmosphere became ""really scary"" after the announcement. 
""Everyone was fuming, they were throwing drinks on the stage and pouring beer everywhere,"" she said.
""There was fighting and people were going up to the stewards to ask what was going on.  
""They literally let us down five minutes before they were coming on. They've taken the absolute mick out of us.""
Ms Simpson has called for a refund after the cancellation, saying she would not want to go to a rescheduled performance.  
Nottinghamshire Police said officers had not received any reports of disturbances. 
A Motorpoint Arena spokesperson added some social media reports of disturbances were ""wholly inaccurate"". 
""There was no major crowd disorder, the police were not needed nor present on site, and there was no criminal damage to any vehicles or the venue itself,"" the spokesperson said.
""In fact, despite their extreme disappointment and frustration, almost everyone behaved very well and we would like to thank our customers for their calm response.""
Some social media users had described the cancellation as ""appalling"" and a ""joke"".
Others asked why organisers had allowed fans to arrive and the other acts to go ahead if they had been aware of Dappy's condition.

politics	Fact-checking Rishi Sunak's first PMQs	"Rishi Sunak faced his first Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.
Here are a few of the claims he made.
Mr Sunak quoted the police numbers in response to a question from Sir Keir Starmer. 
Labour leader wanted to know about  Home Secretary Suella Braverman - who is in charge of policing - and whether her ""integrity and professionalism are beyond question"". 
A target to recruit 20,000 additional police officers in England and Wales by March 2023 was set out in the 2019 Conservative Party manifesto. 
It was an attempt to reverse cuts since 2010, which had seen the number of officers fall by about 19,000.
Figures released on Wednesday, for the period up to 30 September, show that just over 15,300 officers have been recruited. 
So, police forces still have to recruit almost 5,000 more officers to meet the spring deadline.
re also having trouble retaining officers. 
In the year to March 2022, more than 8,000 police officers left forces in England and Wales. That's a 35% increase on the previous year and the highest volume of leavers in almost 20 years.
re are concerns about the impact of so many experienced officers leaving.
rime minister was responding to a question about the need for more doctors and dentists.
He's got his numbers about right. 
re were about 4,000 more community and hospital doctors, and 9,230 more nurses and health visitors working in the NHS in England in June 2022 (the latest figures available) compared with the previous June. That's an increase of about 3% of each.
However, NHS data suggests the number of vacant nursing posts may have increased slightly since last year.
means there might be more staff coming on board, but not fast enough to keep up with growing demand.
rime minister was asked by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas if he would reverse the decision of predecessor Liz Truss to end the ban on fracking.
Ms Lucas drew attention to the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto, which said: ""We will not support fracking unless the science shows categorically that it can be done safely.""
Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a method of recovering oil and gas from shale rock using water, sand and chemicals at high pressure.
Chaos surrounding a vote on fracking was one of the events that led up to the resignation of Liz Truss.
At PMQs, Mr Sunak said he stood by the manifesto stance on fracking.
Downing Street later confirmed it was now government policy to maintain the moratorium.
During the leadership campaign in the summer, Mr Sunak had mirrored the position of Ms Truss on fracking. He said he would support it ""if local communities support it"".
Mr Sunak was responding to a Labour MP who said a nurse would have to work for thousands of years ""to match the vast wealth of this prime minister"".
He was involved in decisions about public sector pay when he was chancellor, from February 2020 until July 2022.
re was particular criticism in March 2021 for the proposed 1% pay rise for nurses in England, which was increased to 3% in July that year, with the award backdated to April. 
Office for National Statistics Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings gives yearly figures for workers in particular jobs.
In the category ""nursing professionals"", median pay - the amount that half of nurses would be earning more than and half earning less than - was £28,864 in April 2020 and £31,676 in April 2022.
's a UK-wide figure, although the Westminster government is only responsible for nurses in England.
rease was wiped out by rising prices over those two years. If anything, it was a small cut in real terms.
Several unions representing nurses are balloting, or planning to ballot members, for strike action over pay, including Unison, the Royal College of Nursing, Royal College of Midwives, GMB and Unite.

sports	World Cup 2022: Wales match beats England game in TV ratings	"More viewers watched Wales play their opening World Cup match than England play theirs, overnight ratings show.
An average UK audience of 7.4 million watched England play Iran on BBC One, according to ratings body Barb.
mpares with 9.4 million who watched Wales play the USA on ITV.
fference can be partly explained by the timings - the England match took place during office hours in the UK on Monday, while the Wales match took place in prime time evening hours.
BBC also drew attention to the large number of viewers who were watching the England match on iPlayer, figures which aren't fully reflected in Barb's terrestrial data. 
It is likely that a larger number of viewers than usual would have been watching on iPlayer during office hours, while away from their traditional TV sets at home.
While England took part in the last World Cup in 2018, the Wales match marked the nation's first in a World Cup for 64 years.
England beat Iran 6-2 on the first day of the tournament in Qatar, while Wales drew 1-1 with the USA.
Wales match also aired on Welsh-language broadcaster S4C, the audience of which is not included in the ITV figures. BBC News has asked S4C for their own audience data.
Gareth Bale said he had ""no doubts"" about taking the penalty which brought Wales their first World Cup goal since 1958.
USA had been heading for victory until Bale was fouled by Walker Zimmerman and stepped up to score the 82nd-minute penalty.
Prince of Wales showed his support by tweeting in the Welsh language, with a picture of his Wales supporters bucket hat.
England's match saw Arsenal ace Bukayo Saka score twice, while the other four goals game from Jude Bellingham, Raheem Sterling, Marcus Rashford and Jack Grealish.
roughout the tournament, the total number of viewers watching any particular match will be higher when further data is added - such as people who watched at different times or on certain catch-up platforms.

business	Cardiff company offers unlimited holidays to reward staff	"A production company has introduced ""unlimited"" annual leave in a bid to reward staff and maximise productivity. 
Big companies such as Netflix, LinkedIn and Goldman Sachs have introduced some unlimited paid holiday leave in recent years. 
Cardiff-based EatSleep Media, which has 13 staff, said it was about ""giving power back"" to them.
An expert said empowering employees improved morale, but clear expectations were necessary. 
EatSleep, which makes documentaries, podcasts and online videos, said it asked its team to work ""very flexibly"", including on evenings, weekends and sometimes abroad. 
Co-founder Alex Feeney said: ""We ask a lot of them, and there are some long days in there, so to not offer some flexibility in return didn't seem quite right.""
He said they always told new staff ""we're not here to parent them"" and that they want employees to be treated like adults in their work.  
""So, if we're empowering them to do that, why wouldn't we do that with other aspects of the work-life balance?"" he said. 
He added when staff came to the end of a big project they could be a bit ""fried"" and the firm didn't want them to worry about whether they could then book time off or whether they needed to save annual leave. 
Mr Feeney said it was about ""giving power back to our team"" based on their needs and ""where the company is at the time"". 
""We want people to be able to go: 'Do you know what - I'm going to take that day, because I deserve it'. Or 'I'm going to take that day I feel a bit fried', or 'I'm going to take that week because I've looked at the workflow and things are a bit quiet'.""
He said it also ""simplified the process"" for the company, as they no longer needed to keep track of things like time in lieu. 
Unlimited paid time off (UPTO) originated at small Silicon Valley start-ups and has become much more common in recent years. 
But the concept is still quite rare, with data from a 2021 survey suggesting just 4% of US companies offer it.
And what sounds like a boundless benefit does often come with caveats. 
Mr Feeney said no-one at EatSleep had yet booked off a longer period of leave, such as a month to three months, and while such a large single block wasn't ""beyond the bounds of possibility"" it would need to be considered against the needs of the company. 
Prof Michael Christie, of Aberystwyth University's Business School, said UPTO was not ""more widespread"" at the moment, but was part of a broader movement towards more flexible working practices post Covid. 
""If employers start reducing the constraints of defined working hours - so rather than saying you have to work nine to five, five days a week - by being more flexible, that allows employees to manage their commitments,"" he said. 
""Empowering employees also improves morale. You don't feel like you're being told to do X, Y and Z - and it allows people to take control of their situations.""
While the idea has been embraced by some businesses, others have experimented with UPTO, only to end the policy and revert to original holiday arrangements.
A 2018 survey showed workers with UPTO took fewer holidays than those with a fixed allocation. 
Prof Christie said there was evidence employees often don't take enough holiday with UPTO and it was necessary for a minimum amount of leave to be set. 
He said there also needed to be ""a clearly defined expectation"" in a UPTO workplace around the practical limits of how much leave someone could actually take against a company's demands. 
""As an employer, you need to make sure your employees are aware of their commitments to that firm,"" he said. 
Mr Feeney said there had been a range of responses to the scheme at EatSleep from people outside the company, including some asking for a job and others dismissing it as part of ""snowflake culture"". 
He added the company's research of others who tried and failed with UPTO had found some workers felt ""obliged not to take time off"" because co-workers had not. 
Mr Feeney said: ""It's like a reverse psychology effect and we're really aware of that. We really want people to take that holiday because we appreciate that they come back refreshed, recharged and ready for the next project.""
He said they had set a lower limit of leave and that in some cases they'd tell people to take leave if they hadn't booked any.
Mr Feeney said it was important for every company to do what worked for them and UPTO wouldn't fit with every business. "	/news/uk-wales-62671704
business	‘My bus ticket was more than I got paid an hour’	"ungest workers have seen the minimum wage rise by less than older colleagues - as the latest employment figures reveal average wages are not keeping up with the rising cost of living.
As a BBC Young Reporter, I wanted to look at this further because of my own experiences at work. 
I've had part-time jobs since I was 15, often earning the minimum wage. As a younger worker that meant I was paid less than older colleagues - even when I was doing the same work. 
It's something I've found really unfair, and I don't think younger people always feel like they can stand up for themselves at work. 
It's a issue some of my friends say they've also experienced. 
""It's frustrating,"" says 15-year-old Isabella, who left her job in a restaurant because she earned less than her colleagues - with the only difference being that she couldn't serve alcohol.
""It was a small place and we were all doing the same thing, but for different amounts,"" she says.
Isabella was being paid the minimum wage - which at the time was £4.62 an hour for people aged under 18. ""The bus ticket into town, for the day, was around £4.80 I think, so my bus ticket was more than I was earning per hour."" 
Data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that minimum rates of pay have gone up less for those under 20 than for older workers since 2016.
In April, the minimum wage went up to £4.81 per hour for those under 18, a 24% increase on the rate in 2016, which was £3.87 per hour. 
But for 21 and 22-year-olds it rose by 37% over the same period, from £6.70 to £9.18 per hour. And it climbed by 42% to £9.50 per hour for 23 and 24-year-olds.
r cohort have since 2017 been paid what is known as the National Living Wage. Originally for over-25s, it has been extended to all workers over 23, and there are plans to lower the threshold further to 21 by 2024.
Later this month, the Low Pay Commission - an independent body that advises the government - will make its recommendations on what minimum wage rates should be for next year. The Commission says its remit is to push pay for younger workers as high as possible without damaging their employment prospects.  
Richard Davies, Professor of Public Understanding of Economics at Bristol University, tells me that's important because ""if you have a long period of being unemployed when you're young, that can affect you for the rest of your life"".
He also explains that the lower minimum wage for young people also ""rests on the idea that they will have fewer skills and lower productivity than older workers"", adding that there is also an assumption that young people are getting something back.
""The deal is that by going to work, you're also being trained. So the firm is giving you something - and that makes it fair that they pay you a little less.""
's certainly something Nick Collins believes his business, Loungers, offers. 
More than 6,000 people work for the bar and restaurant chain - and 40% are under 21. 
""We used to pay everyone the same,"" he says. ""But when the National Living Wage started to climb it became less affordable for us."" 
New starters joining his company are now paid less if they're under 18 or under 21, but he says they can ""progress quickly"" and once they're in more senior roles are paid the same regardless of age. 
""We agonised over it a lot, we didn't like doing it,"" he says, adding that all under-18s and under-21s earn at least £8 per hour - more than the minimum wage. 
But Mr Collins acknowledges that attracting and retaining staff in hospitality is getting harder - competing with sectors like retail where hours can be more sociable and pay can be higher.
""I'd love to pay everyone more, but we just wouldn't be able to sustain that,"" he tells me.
I now work in a supermarket where I earn more than £10 an hour. Everyone there is paid the same regardless of their age, including my school friend Tabitha, who works there too.
She left a job at a bowling alley where she was being paid the minimum wage.
""It was awful,"" she says. ""The pay didn't match up to the work we had to do - there was a lot of stress."" 
""The older people would be working on the bar, standing around chatting, and the younger people would be running around, really busy, trying to make sure the jobs were finished.""
As for asking for a pay rise, Tabitha says it ""simply doesn't happen when you're this young"", adding that ""no one takes you seriously"".
But that may be changing. 
As the latest figures show the unemployment rate at its lowest for nearly 50 years, Tony Wilson from the Institute for Employment Studies says young people are ""voting with their feet.""
""We've got the highest number of people changing jobs that we've ever seen,"" he says. ""That is prompting employers to try and treat people better around pay and around fairness at work.""
So is there an argument for paying everyone the same, regardless of age? Perhaps not everyone, says Tony Wilson.
""My worry would be that if employers had to pay 16 and 17-year-olds £9.50 an hour, they just wouldn't do it,"" he tells me. 
""But when you get up to ages 18, 19, or 20, I think it's harder to justify paying people £6 something an hour when their colleagues are getting £9 something an hour.""
A spokesperson from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said:  ""While we know the priority for younger workers in those first years is to secure work and gain experience, we are nevertheless determined to ensure it pays properly.""

health	Hasnath Miah: Tributes to 'Didcot hero' takeaway owner	"ributes have been paid to an Indian takeaway owner who donated thousands of meals during the Covid pandemic.
Hasnath Miah, 49, fed homeless people, the low paid and key workers, Oxfordshire County Council said.
Before his death on Thursday, he announced that he would give away meals to those in need on Christmas Day.
South Oxfordshire councillor Ian Snowdon said: ""His kindness and generosity made him a true hero of Didcot.""
Mr Snowdon added: ""He offered to deliver food to NHS staff and volunteers, even though [the pandemic] was a difficult time for his business.""
Oxfordshire county councillor, Sally Povolotsky, said: ""He was an endless giver with an extremely big heart. There are not many people like Hasnath left in the world.""
Mr Miah's family said he died in Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital after suffering a stroke.
In August 2021, he won an award from the High Sheriff of Oxfordshire for his efforts since the first lockdown.
Oxfordshire county councillor John Howson told the ceremony: ""He gave away more than 7,000 free hot meals. He will never turn away anyone that is hungry.
""He went on to host free meals for young carers every month. He has done all this off his own back and asks for nothing in return.""
In November, Mr Miah posted on Facebook that his takeaway Indian Dream would be open on Christmas Day. 
He wrote: ""Free dinner for homeless and people live alone and older people. I love to cook for you. I know how pain full is live alone.""
Anna Gatrell, who organises annual free Christmas Day lunches in Didcot, said Mr Miah came to two of her events when he first arrived in the town.
She said: ""He was homeless in Reading and when he came to Didcot he was astounded by the kindness of people.
""When [his business] became a success he decided to give back to the community of Didcot who made him feel at home and welcomed him.""

business	Oil price rises as EU cuts Russian imports	"Oil prices have hit fresh highs after European Union leaders agreed on a plan to block more than two-thirds of Russian oil imports.
Brent crude rose above $123 a barrel on Tuesday, the highest it has been for two months.
Prices for oil and gas have soared in recent months, fuelled by the lifting of lockdowns and the Ukraine war.
Rising energy costs are putting pressure on consumers, making it more expensive to heat homes and drive.
Petrol hit a new record of 173.02p a litre on Monday, according to the AA.
At the same time, the average price of diesel in the UK rose to 182.58p a litre, it said.
Filling a typical 55-litre tank of a diesel now costs more than £100.
war in Ukraine has pushed countries in the West to shun Russian energy supplies.
Russia currently supplies 27% of the EU's imported oil and 40% of its gas. The EU pays Russia around €400bn (£341bn) a year in return.
greed by EU leaders will see an immediate ban on Russian oil being transported into the bloc by sea. Two-thirds of Russian oil arrives by sea.
However, the deal, which followed weeks of wrangling, includes a temporary exemption for pipeline oil following opposition from Hungary.
Pledges by Poland and Germany to stop importing pipeline oil by the end of this year will raise coverage of the ban to 90% of Russian imports.
Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil prices, has risen more than 70% over the past year.
Oil prices climbed again on news of the EU embargo, with Brent crude reaching its highest level since March.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said confirmation that the EU will cut its purchases of Russian oil by the end of 2022 is pushing up prices because European countries now need to find alternative sources of supply.
""It is not feasible to replace that amount of energy with other fuel sources, such as wind, solar, biomass or nuclear, in such a short space of time, so the EU needs to find oil and gas from somewhere,"" Mr Mould said.
""This will not be easy because existing global output may well be on contract already, so competition for what is not on contract will now be hotter.""
Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the upwards trajectory of oil prices may continue until Western countries outline clearly how supply is going to be sourced.
""It's possible this could get tougher before it gets better,"" she said.
""We know that rising energy costs are a particular challenge for households which already have severe pressure on their incomes, but smaller businesses shouldn't be left out of the equation either - this is a tough time to be heating offices, and at a time when it's meant to be about rebuilding resilience after the pandemic.""
European Council chief Charles Michel said the deal cut off ""a huge source of financing"" for the Russian war machine.
It is part of a sixth package of sanctions approved at a summit in Brussels, which all 27 member states have had to agree on.
So far, no sanctions on Russian gas exports to the EU have been put in place, although plans to open a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany have been frozen.
EU members spent hours struggling to resolve their differences over the ban on Russian oil imports.
Hungary, which imports 65% of its oil from Russia through pipelines, resisted the new round of sanctions.
f living crisis being felt across Europe has not helped either. Sky-rocketing energy prices - among other things - have curtailed some EU countries' appetite for sanctions which could also hurt their own economies."	/news/business-61643613
technology	Microsoft-Activision deal: Gamers sue to stop merger	"Microsoft faces legal action from 10 gamers to block its merger with Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.
wsuit filed in a US federal court says the $69bn (£56bn) deal by the Xbox console maker to purchase its rival will ""create a monopoly in the video game industry"".
mplaint comes two weeks after US regulators filed a case with an administrative judge to block the deal. 
merger would be the largest tech deal ever in the video gaming market. 
roposed acquisition would give Microsoft ""far-outsized market power in the video game industry,"" according to the complaint ""with the ability to foreclose rivals, limit output, reduce consumer choice, raise prices, and further inhibit competition.""
However, Microsoft is defending the proposed acquisition. ""This deal will expand competition and create more opportunities for gamers and game developers as we seek to bring more games to more people,"" according to a spokesman.  
Almost two weeks ago, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) raised similar concerns in their complaint. The US business watchdog said Activision was one of a small number of top video game developers that made high-quality games for multiple devices.
roposed acquisition would give Microsoft ""both the means and motive to harm competition"" by manipulating pricing, making games worse on its competitors' video game consoles, ""or withholding content from competitors entirely, resulting in harm to consumers,"" the agency said in a press release.  
After the FTC filed its lawsuit, Microsoft president Brad Smith said the company had ""complete confidence in our case and welcome the opportunity to present our case in court"".
Microsoft also announced it will make Call of Duty available on Nintendo for 10 years if the purchase went through and made a similar offer to rival Sony which makes the PlayStation console.
""This sounds alarming, so I want to reinforce my confidence that this deal will close,"" Activision Blizzard chief executive Bobby Kotick wrote in a letter to staff that was shared on the company's website. ""The allegation that this deal is anti-competitive doesn't align with the facts, and we believe we'll win this challenge.""

health	Midwives in Scotland reject latest NHS pay offer	"Members of the union representing midwives in Scotland have rejected the latest NHS pay offer. 
Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said 65% of members voted against it. The union will now consider next steps including possible industrial action. 
NHS offered an average pay increase of 7.5%. It was accepted by Unison and Unite members but rejected by the GMB.
Scottish government has said the proposal was unprecedented at a time of ""extraordinary financial challenges"".
Royal College of Nursing has also rejected the pay offer and said it would soon announce dates for strikes. 
Jaki Lambert, RCM director for Scotland, said: ""Our members have spoken loud and clear - the latest pay offer by the Scottish government is simply not good enough. It goes nowhere near addressing the rising cost of living and would see many midwives actually worse off in real terms.
""Our members have been consistent throughout this process - they want a decent deal, and they are prepared to take industrial action to get one. 
""No midwife wants to do this and it is for the Scottish government to make sure that they do not feel that they are left with no other option. 
""While we acknowledge that the Scottish government has listened to some of the concerns regarding career opportunities and development, it has failed to meet our members' needs on pay.""
Last month, Holyrood ministers tabled an improved pay offer averaging 7.5% to health workers threatening industrial action.
Annual salary rises under the proposal would range from a flat rate payment of £2,205 for staff in Bands 1 to 4 and up to £2,660 for staff in Bands 5 to 7, backdated to April. 
represents an increase of 11.3% for the lowest paid workers and delivers an average uplift of 7.5%.
Unite and Unison chose to accept the deal, however, the GMB union became the first to reject it last week.
Scottish government said previously that the pay offer was unprecedented for front-line employees and would ensure NHS workers in Scotland remain the best paid in the UK.
RCM is part of the Scottish Terms and Conditions Committee (STAC), which negotiates pay deals with the Scottish government. STAC staff will meet with ministers on Thursday to share the outcomes of their respective consultations, the RCM said. "	/news/uk-scotland-64050826
health	Industrial action by health workers in NI begins	"Healthcare workers from two of Northern Ireland's biggest unions have begun industrial action in a dispute about pay.
Nipsa members started ""indefinite action short of strike"" on Monday.
Unison members are taking similar action on Monday and will follow that with a one-day strike on 12 December.
unions announced their action after the Royal College of Nursing said its members would strike on 15 and 20 December.
Nipsa members are taking the action over three issues: pay, staffing levels within the health service and travel reimbursement.
Unison's action is over pay for its members.
Health workers in Northern Ireland have yet to receive an increase in pay for the 2022-23 financial year.
In July an independent pay review body recommended that they should receive a rise of £1,400.
Unison representative Anne Speed told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme the union was seeking an ""inflation-busting pay rise"" for its members.
""What it means is inflation is 11%, and a pay rise actually has to match that in order to protect workers,"" she said.
""What's being awarded is only half of inflation, and health workers are just frustrated, fed up, very disappointed and they're choosing to speak out now.""
Ms Speed added that unions were prepared to negotiate, but the responsibility fell on Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, due political stalemate at Stormont.
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) withdrew from the executive earlier this year in protest over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is part of the Brexit deal.
In England and Wales, NHS staff have been given a rise of at least £1,400.
Unions in Scotland are considering a government offer averaging 7.5%.
re are several reasons why workers are taking industrial action, including the failure by the Stormont executive to trigger a pay increase while the cost of living soars.
Workers in the Unison and Nipsa unions want staff shortages addressed and feel their efforts during the pandemic should be recognised financially.
It will take a lot to resolve the industrial dispute.
But the unions say that for starters, in the absence of devolved government, civil servants could agree to pay workers the recommended rate that has been granted elsewhere.
Nipsa and Unison action will take the form of work to rule - members will only take on work required in their contracts.
Nipsa deputy general secretary Pádraig Mulholland said those who were taking the action were the ""heroes who brought us through Covid and are now standing up for the health service"".
He said that during the action members would:
Unison said its members were frustrated and angry and ""are now the lowest paid part of the UK NHS workforce"".
union said the cost-of-living crisis was biting deep and it was foolish to assume workers would ""suck it up"".
Regarding the strike planned for 12 December, Unison said employers would be advised in the coming days of the full scope of the action.
In a joint statement the unions said the safety of health service patients was ""very important for health staff who will take industrial action"".
""Discussions have already begun to ensure the employers take the necessary steps to protect patients during the dispute,"" they said.
Stormont's Department of Health said the health authorities would work to protect critical services as much as possible during the industrial action.
But it warned that there would ""inevitably be an impact on patient care"".

politics	Government to share energy-saving tips in TV ads	"UK government will promote energy-saving tips in adverts on TV and at bus stops as part of an information campaign due to be launched this week.
mpaign will feature ads with the strapline ""It All Adds Up"" and a new website with advice such as turning down boilers.
Business Secretary Grant Shapps is expected to be involved in messaging to help households reduce energy use.
government estimates the campaign will cost taxpayers about £18m.
w website is expected to go live on Saturday before adverts on TV, radio and on the sides of buses appear after Christmas.
A government source said they were keen to get Mr Shapps out doing interviews and possibly recording videos for promotion on social media.
urce said the campaign will be pushed out on government social media channels and ""we'll try to get energy-saving networks such as Which? and energy companies to help get it to as wide an audience as possible"".
One of the main focuses will be encouraging households to lower their boiler-flow temperature to 60C in order to save an estimated £100 a year.
Other advice will include turning off appliances at the plug when they are not in use, and draught-proofing windows and doors by putting blankets under them.
mpaign, designed by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), is part of the government's push to curb energy use during the cost-of-living crisis.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's approach has differed to that of his predecessor, Liz Truss, who was reported to have been ""ideologically opposed"" to an energy-saving a campaign.
But her government changed tack and said it was considering how to expand the existing Help for Households website.
One government source said the campaign being launched this weekend was an extension of that website.
Help for Households website includes actions such as turning down radiators not in use to save an estimated £70 per year.
government has capped the amount per unit of energy suppliers can charge consumers so that a typical bill remains at £2,500 a year until the end of March.
But help with energy costs will be less generous from April, with bills for a typical household going up to £3,000.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has described cutting energy use as a ""national mission"" to stop the UK being ""blackmailed"" by the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
war in Ukraine has tightened supplies of gas, which the UK is heavily reliant on for heating and powering its homes and businesses.
Mr Hunt said ""in the end everyone is going to have to take responsibility for their energy bills"" and consider how to cut their consumption."	/news/uk-politics-63971909
business	'Warning lights flash' as more workers seek help, says Citizens Advice	"""warning lights are flashing red"" as the number of people in work seeking crisis support has more than doubled in two years, according to a charity.
Citizens Advice says it referred 6,983 employed people for crisis support between July and September this year.
mpares with 2,780 people in the same period in 2020.
figures come as the cost of living is rising at the fastest rate for 40 years.
""Every day, our advisers hear stories of people skipping meals, going without essentials and then coming to us when they simply can't cut back any more. This cannot continue"", said Morgan Wild, Head of Policy at Citizens Advice. 
""We have seen the difference government support can have but the warning lights are still flashing red for the future,"" he added.
rity also said that the number of people supported this year so far had already exceeded those across the last three years. 
figures also represent a sharp from last year, when 4,291 people were referred in the third quarter.
rity also warned that the number of people it is supporting could triple if the government decides not to raise benefits in line with inflation, which measures the cost of living.
government has not committed to raising benefits using this measure but the chancellor is expected to announce its decision in the Autumn Statement on 17 November.
Just over 9,000 unemployed people have received crisis support from the charity in the third quarter of this year, compared to 6,190 last year, according to its latest cost of living data.
f living is increasing at the fastest rate for 40 years, largely as a result of energy and food prices going up, with inflation currently stood at 10.1%.
A government scheme to limit typical household energy bills to £2,500 a year has been in place since October, but is due to end in April next year, with more targeted help to follow. 
In England, Scotland and Wales, everyone's energy bills are being cut by £400 over six months, with an additional £650 of support for lower-income households.
Citizens Advice said its data shows the government support is helping but that the impact is limited according to its figures, and there's concern about what happens when support measures end.
""We need action which matches the scale of this crisis. At a minimum, benefits must be increased in line with inflation at next week's Autumn Statement and further energy support should be offered to those on the lowest incomes,"" Mr Wild said.
rity said that as energy bills have risen, more and more people are looking for practical advice on how to make their homes more energy efficient to reduce costs.
Consumer Affairs Correspondent Colletta Smith has some tips for cutting costs in your home.
It is also continuing to see record numbers of pre-pay gas and electricity customers who cannot afford to top up their meters. 
It saw a small fall in the number of people who couldn't afford to top up their pre-payment meters in October, which it attributes to the first tranche of the government support payments, but added it was still the third highest month on record. 
So far this year, the charity has already seen more people unable to top up than the total number of people seen in the five previous years combined. 
In addition to the number of people unable to top up, the charity said it was concerned about the high number of people having pre-payment meters forcibly installed because they're falling into debt with their energy companies. 
week, the BBC reported that a rising number of households are having their energy smart meters remotely switched to pre-payment meters by their supplier, without their permission.

With a family to support and little education, he searched the internet for other money-making ideas. He had some success growing vegetables in plastic bottles, but then came across a potentially more profitable crop - pearls.
""Rajasthan is a dry area with water issues. It was a challenge to think of growing pearls with limited water but I decided to try,"" he says.
Pearls are formed when a mollusc reacts to an irritant in its protective membrane. The mollusc deposits layers of aragonite and conchiolin, which together form nacre, also know as mother-of-pearl.
In the wild, pearl formation is rare so most pearls sold these days are from farmed molluscs, usually oysters or freshwater mussels. 
ur the mollusc to form a pearl, an irritant is artificially introduced into the creature. However, it is a delicate process and the mussels or oysters must be carefully handled, as Mr Garwa found.
""My first attempt was a disaster,"" he admits. Of the 500 mussels he purchased, only 35 survived. 
Mr Garwa had travelled to Kerala to buy the mussels - a journey of 1,700 miles involving a 36-hour train journey. He also used his savings and borrowed money to come up with the 16,000 rupees (£170; $200) needed to buy the molluscs.
In addition, Mr Garwa had dug a 10ft by 10ft pond in his back garden to keep the creatures in.
Despite the setback, he did not give up. Instead, he took a five-day course in pearl farming.
""Growing an oyster is like bringing up a baby,"" he says.
""Monitoring the the water throughout the growth period is crucial to achieving high quality and volume of produce.""
Now he has a 40ft by 50ft pond, which he treats with multivitamins and alum which maintains the correct pH level required for growth. 
urvival rate of his mussels has risen from 30% to more than 70% since becoming more familiar with the process. Mr Garwa expects to produce around 3,000 pearls this year, which he can sell for between 400 and 900 rupees (£4-£10; $5-$11).
Indian government has been encouraging pearl fishing as part of its Blue Revolution, a plan to modernise the nation's fishing industry.
Under the scheme the government pays for half the cost of setting up a pond for pearl fishing, and so far the Department for Fisheries has given financial support to 232 pearl farming ponds.
""Pearl farming is one of the most lucrative aquaculture businesses and the government is encouraging farmers to take up this farming,"" says Jujjavarapu Balaji, Joint Secretary of Marine Fisheries.
Not everyone is impressed with this wave of pearl farming activity. Critics include Gunjan Shah, who is the fifth generation of his family to be in the pearl trading business.
""The culture of pearl farming has increased in India but I think the pearls grown in every nook and corner are not of very good quality"" says the owner of Babla Enterprises, based in Mumbai.
More technology of business:
He says India is producing too many of the wrong kind of pearls.
""What India needs at present is people who can grow sea water pearls if we want to compete with China. Indian oysters are small but China has hybrid oysters which produce large pearls.
""Cultured South Sea pearls are the most valuable type of cultured pearl on the market today. These pearls come in a gorgeous variety of sizes, shapes and colours. A strand of South Sea pearls can be as expensive as $10,000 (£8,500) or more. They are very rarely produced in India.""
He says the government should be looking to develop this part of the industry.
In its defence, the government says it will take time to build up a competitive pearl farming sector.
""Pearl family is specialised farming, so this sector will take time to grow. The plan is to see the increase in the next three years,"" says Mr Balaji, from the Department for Fisheries.
""Once we are able to grow enough pearls for local consumption then we can focus on exports,"" he adds.
As for Mr Garwa, as well as farming pearls, he also offers courses for those who want to learn how to do it.
Reena Choudary, 28, was one of his students, and just like her tutor her first effort last year was a failure.
""I lost all the oysters - none of them were able to produce,"" she says.
But this year, she expects to produce around 1,000 pearls. 
Starting an independent business was a big leap for her, particularly as women in her region are often expected to look after the home rather than work. 
""For people like us this smells like freedom,"" she says. ""We have learnt how we can be independent, help towards contributing to the family and have a say in family matters."""	/news/business-62204515
politics	Suffrage colours 'not banned' says Holyrood presiding officer	"Scottish Parliament's presiding officer Alison Johnstone has apologised after a woman was ejected from a committee meeting for refusing to remove a scarf in suffragette colours.
woman was asked to leave a session of the equalities committee, which was discussing proposed reforms to Scotland's gender recognition laws.
Ms Johnstone told MSPs: ""Let me make one thing crystal clear - suffrage colours are not, and never have been, banned at the Scottish Parliament.

technology	Inside a US military cyber team’s defence of Ukraine	"Russia failed to take down Ukrainian computer systems with a massive cyber-attack when it invaded this year, despite many analysts' predictions. The work of a little-known arm of the US military which hunts for adversaries online may be one reason. The BBC was given exclusive access to the cyber-operators involved in these global missions.
In early December last year, a small US military team led by a young major arrived in Ukraine on a reconnaissance trip ahead of a larger deployment. But the major quickly reported that she needed to stay.  
""Within a week we had the whole team there ready to go hunting,"" one of the team recalls. 
me to detect Russians online and their Ukrainian partners made it clear they needed to start work straight away. 
""She looked at the situation and told me the team wouldn't leave,"" Maj Gen William J Hartman, who heads the US Cyber National Mission Force, told the BBC. 
""We almost immediately got the feedback that 'it's different in Ukraine right now'. We didn't redeploy the team, we reinforced the team.""
Since 2014, Ukraine has witnessed some of the world's most significant cyber-attacks, including the first in which a power station was switched off remotely in the dead of winter. 
By late last year, Western intelligence officials were watching Russian military preparations and growing increasingly concerned that a new blizzard of cyber-attacks would accompany an invasion, crippling communications, power, banking and government services, to pave the way for the seizure of power. 
US military Cyber Command wanted to discover whether Russian hackers had already infiltrated Ukrainian systems, hiding deep inside. Within two weeks, their mission became one of its largest deployments with around 40 personnel from across US armed services.
In January they had a front-row seat as Russia began paving the way in cyberspace for a coming invasion in which Ukraine's cyber-defences would be put to an unprecedented test. 
filtration of computer networks had for many years been primarily about espionage - stealing secrets - but recently has been increasingly militarised and linked to more destructive activities like sabotage or preparation for war. 
means a new role for the US military, whose teams are engaged in ""Hunt Forward"" missions, scouring the computer networks of partner countries for signs of penetration. 
""They are hunters and they know the behaviour of their 'prey',"" explains the operator who leads defensive work against Russia. 
US military asked for some operators to remain anonymous and others to be identified only by their first names due to security concerns.
Since 2018, US military operators have been deployed to 20 countries, usually close allies, in Europe, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific region. - although not countries like the UK, Germany or France, which have their own expertise and are less likely to need or want outside help. 
Most of their work has been battling state-hackers from China and North Korea but Russia has been their most persistent adversary. Some countries have seen multiple deployments, including Ukraine, where for the first time cyber attacks were combined with a full-scale war.
Inviting the US military into your country can be sensitive and even controversial domestically, so many partners ask that the US presence remains secret - the teams rarely wear uniform. But increasingly, governments are choosing to make missions public.
In May, Lithuania confirmed a three-month deployment had just finished working on its defence and foreign affairs networks, prioritised because of concerns over threats from Russia in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. 
Croatia hosted the most recent deployment. ""The hunt was thorough and successful, and we discovered and prevented malicious attacks on Croatian state infrastructure,"" Daniel Markić, the head of the country's security and intelligence agency, says.
""We were able to offer the US a new 'hunting ground' for malicious actors and share our experience and acquired knowledge,"" he adds.
But warm public statements mask the reality that these missions often begin uneasily. 
Even countries allied to the US can be nervous about allowing the US to root around inside sensitive government networks. In fact, revelations from former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden 10 years ago suggested that the US spied on friends as well as enemies.
uspicion means the young men and women arriving on a mission are often faced with a stern test of their diplomatic skills. They show up at an airport hauling dozens of boxes of mysterious technical equipment and need to quickly build trust to get permission to do something sensitive - install that equipment on the host country's government computer networks to scan for threats. 
""That is a pretty scary proposition if you're a host nation,"" explains Gen Hartman. ""You immediately have some concern that we're going to go do something nefarious or it's some super-secret kind of backdoor operation.""
Put simply, the Americans need to convince their hosts they are there to help them - and not to spy on them.
""I'm not interested in your emails,"" is how Mark, who led two teams in the Indo-Pacific region, describes his opening gambit. If a demonstration goes well they can get down to work.
Local partners sometimes sit with US teams around in conference rooms observing closely to make sure nothing untoward is going on. ""We have to make sure we convey that trust,"" says Eric, a 20-year veteran of cyber operations. ""Having people sit side-saddle with us is a big factor in developing that.""  
And although suspicion can never be totally dispelled, a common adversary binds them together.
""The one thing that these partners want is the Russians out of their networks,"" Gen Hartman recalls one of his team telling him. 
US Cyber Command offers an insight into what the Russians, or others, are up to, particularly since it works closely with the National Security Agency, America's largest intelligence agency which monitors communications and cyberspace.
In one case, proof of infiltration came in real-time. One US operator, Chris, who has led multiple European missions, recalls observing someone move suspiciously around the computer network of a partner country. 
What was bizarre was that it appeared to be one of the local network administrators the team was working with. That person was standing right behind Chris. Could it be some kind of insider threat?
""Is that you?"" Chris asked. 
""That is my computer, but I swear that's not me,"" the administrator responded, transfixed as if watching a movie. Someone had stolen his online identity. 
""Finding someone on your network is not a good moment especially when they are using your credentials,"" Chris recalls. That moment conveyed the reality of the threat and in turn helped secure more access. 
US teams say they share what they find to allow the local partner to eject Russians (or other state hackers) rather than do it themselves. They also use commercial tools so that local partners can continue after the mission is over. 
A good relationship can pay dividends. At the end of one mission, US operators say that local partners handed them a parting gift - a computer disc containing malicious software, or malware, from another network the team had not been inside.
Each mission is different and there are some where an adversary has been found on the very first day of looking, explains Shannon who has led two missions in Europe. But it often takes a week or two to unearth more advanced hackers who have burrowed deeper.
A cat-and-mouse game is often played with hackers from Russian intelligence agencies who are particularly adept at changing tactics.
In 2021, it emerged the Russians had used software from a company called SolarWinds to infiltrate the networks of the customers who bought it, including governments.
US operators began looking for traces of their presence. A tech sergeant in Cyber Command who liked puzzles spotted the way the Russians were hiding their code in one European country, General Hartman says. Unscrambling it, he was able to establish the Russians were hiding on a network. Eight different samples of malicious software, all attributed to Russian intelligence, were then made public to allow industry to improve defences. 
Hunting is not an altruistic act by the US military. As well as providing hands-on experience for its teams, it can also help at home. In one mission, a young enlisted cyber operator found the same malware they had discovered in a European country was also present on a US government agency. The US has often struggled to identify and root out vulnerabilities domestically, whether in industry or government, because of overlapping responsibilities between different agencies even as it sends out its operators abroad.
Hunt Forward missions are classed as ""defensive"" but Gen Paul Nakasone, who leads both the military's Cyber Command and the National Security Agency confirmed offensive missions have also been undertaken against Russia in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. But he and others declined to provide further detail.
January, the team in Ukraine were trying to avoid slipping on icy pavements when a series of major cyber-attacks hit. ""Be afraid and expect the worst,"" read a message posted by hackers on the Foreign Ministry website.
US team watched in real-time as a wave of so-called wiper software, which renders computers unusable, hit multiple government websites.  
""They were able to assist in analysing some of the ongoing attacks, and facilitate that information being shared back to partners in the United States,"" Gen Hartman says.
m was to destabilise the country ahead of the February invasion.
By the time Russian troops flooded over the border, the US team had been pulled out. Knowledge of the physical risk for their Ukrainian partners who remained weighed heavily on them.
Hours before the invasion began on 24 February, a cyber-attack crippled a US satellite communications provider that supported the Ukrainian military. Many predicted this would be the start of a wave of attacks to take down key areas like railways. But that did not happen.
""One of the reasons the Russians may not have been so successful is that the Ukrainians were better prepared,"" says Gen Hartman. 
""There's a lot of pride in the way they were able to defend. A lot of the world thought they would just be run over. And they weren't,"" says Al, a senior technical analyst who was part of the Ukrainian deployment team. ""They resisted.""
Ukraine has been subject to continued cyber-attacks which, if successful, could have affected infrastructure. But the country has continued to defend itself better than many expected. Ukrainian officials have said that this has been in part thanks to help from allies, including US Cyber Command and the private sector as well as their own growing experience. Now, the US and other allies are turning to the Ukrainians to learn from them. 
""We continue to share information with the Ukrainians, they continue to share information with us,"" explains Gen Hartman. ""That's really the whole idea of that enduring partnership."" 
With Ukrainian and Western intelligence officials expressing concerns that Moscow may respond to recent military setbacks by escalating its cyber-attacks, it is a partnership that may still face further tests."	/news/uk-63328398
politics	Matt Hancock: A quick guide to the I'm A Celeb MP	"Matt Hancock is headed for the Australian jungle to be a contestant on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! If you don't regularly follow politics, here's what you need to know about the former health secretary. 
He has been suspended as a Conservative MP since announcing he was off to Australia. One Tory colleague described him as an ""absolute prat"" and he has faced calls from opposition politicians to give up his MP's salary, £84,144 a year.
He was appointed health secretary in 2018, before overseeing pandemic restrictions including lockdowns and social distancing.
footage, which showed him breaking his own social distancing rules with his political aide and university friend Gina Coladangelo, was leaked to the Sun. 
Dominic Cummings, who was Boris Johnson's closest advisor, claimed Mr Hancock had lied about Covid testing hospital patients before they were released into care homes. This was firmly denied by Mr Hancock. Mr Cummings also published expletive-laden messages about a different issue, purportedly from Boris Johnson, in which the PM calls the health secretary ""hopeless"".
Born and raised in Cheshire, he studied philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University and then economics at Cambridge. Before becoming MP for West Suffolk he worked for his family's computer software business and as an economist for the Bank of England. He has three children.
He's said he hopes to use his time in the jungle to raise awareness about the learning difficulty that affects reading and writing. 
In 2012, he won a charity horse race after training for three months, losing two stone in the process. Nicknamed ""Action Matt"" by the press, photos of him running, swimming and jumping over small fences often appear in the newspapers."	/news/uk-63489101
technology	Meta, Amazon, Twitter layoffs: 'Tech layoffs won't destroy American dreams of Indians’	"Many Indians who work on temporary visas in the US are facing an uncertain future after mass layoffs at big tech firms. Surbhi Gupta, who lost her job at Meta, tells her story of in her own words.
It was my mum's birthday. I was staying up late to wish her and that's when I started getting messages from my friends about layoff announcements. They were all anxious.
At around 6am here, I received an email that I'd been let go. I had joined Meta earlier this year as a product manager. My team was shocked because I'd been performing really well.
It went against my motto, work is worship, instilled early by my favourite teacher at school. Initially, it felt like the Titanic sinking because I was losing access to things one by one - workplace, then email, then laptop. But I was pleasantly overwhelmed and surprised in a positive way by my network on LinkedIn. Many colleagues, ex-colleagues and friends reached out in a very supportive way, making introductions and referrals. It made me feel like I have so many people in this country who care for me, made me feel like I belong to this country.
My last day at Meta is in January and my H1-B visa [a non-immigrant visa that allows firms in the US to hire foreigners for up to six years] allows me to stay in the US for another 60 days, so early March is the deadline for me to find another job. 
job search is going to be difficult now as hiring will be slow in December because of the holidays. But I'm very focused. I am in touch with multiple companies and exploring options.
What I'll miss most about Meta is the workplace and my colleagues. Being at Meta meant not only being able to build an amazing product for millions of people, but also being able to participate in fireside chats and growth and learning opportunities. As a product manager, it would have been rewarding to see the project I was working on go further.
My parents taught me to never give up in life. They tell me to stay strong because I'm a person who can convert problems into opportunities. They tell me 'aur kuch accha mil jayega' [you'll find something better].
But my ability to work and stay in the US depends on my H1-B visa. I moved to the US in 2009 and I have worked very hard to build my career on my own strength and intellect. I have worked in prominent companies like Tesla, Intuit, etc., built great products, got top ratings, paid taxes, and contributed to the US economy for more than 15 years, but I feel that I am in the same place as far as permanent residency goes because of the limitations of the H1-B. I was crowned Miss Bharat California [a beauty pageant] by my idol, Bollywood actress Sushmita Sen. I have walked the ramp at New York Fashion Week. I have my own podcast. 
We face unnecessary stress because the US has a country cap which takes forever for Indian H1-B holders to get a green card (permanent residency). Even though I am in the green card queue, when I track my status, I sometimes get a wait-time of two decades, and at other times, 60 years.
Our personal life suffers because of the uncertainty. Buying a home has been a question mark in my mind - do I invest in a home and then what if I have to leave. In spite of having gone ahead with the YC [Y Combinator is an American technology start-up accelerator], I can't start a company even though I have a great idea because I don't have a green card.
I travelled to 30 countries before turning 30 years old, but now I'm unable to travel much, even though it's my dream to travel the world, because I'm nervous about facing problems while trying to get my H1-B visa re-stamped. I have heard from my friends who work at great companies like Google and PayPal about getting stuck abroad.
I have even curtailed my travels home to India. A few years back, I got stuck in India. I had gone to attend a wedding and I had to get my H1-B visa stamped. But that took several months as it went into random administrative processing and I wasn't even sure when it would come through. The uncertainty and the wait caused problems in my marriage. The visa issues had a very big role in my marriage. It was not the only reason, but it became one of the major reasons for the break-up of my marriage. I also had to drop out of a semester at New York University, where I was studying at the time, because I didn't know when I would be able to return to the US. Why do people on H1-Bs have to deal with this?
I have not met my parents since the Covid-19 pandemic because they haven't been able to come to visit me for three-and-a-half years. They are elderly, and don't keep too well. I constantly think - if my parents need support, will I be able to go to help them? Nobody realises how it impacts our life.
But despite whatever has happened, I believe this experience too has a silver lining. Spirituality is a significant part of my life. I am a believer and follower of Sadhguru ji [as followers refer to Indian yoga guru Jaggi Vasudev]. He says that we should not be identified only by or limit our identity to our professional role. In Silicon Valley, the most frequently asked question is - Which company do you work for? But I am still me, not just a product manager. Everyone should realise that they are more than just the company they work for.

politics	Rishi Sunak: World leaders welcome next UK prime minister	"World leaders have been reacting to Rishi Sunak's victory in the race to be the next British prime minister. 
Many offered their congratulations, and expressed hope for stability after a ""turbulent"" few weeks. 
What the leadership is saying: ""As you become UK PM, I look forward to working closely together on global issues, and implementing Roadmap 2030,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, referring to a framework agreement struck between the two countries. ""Special Diwali wishes to the 'living bridge' of UK Indians, as we transform our historic ties into a modern partnership.""
What the press is saying: Mr Sunak's appointment has been big news in India, with Indian news channels breaking into rolling coverage. ""Indian son rises over the Empire, history comes full circle in Britain,"" was how one channel put it.
kground: It is no surprise that there is a lot of interest in Mr Sunak's rise in India. His grandparents come from Punjab, while his father-in-law is Narayana Murthy, the founder of Infosys and one of India's best-known businessmen. Sunak is also a Hindu who took his oath as MP on the Hindu holy book the Bhagavad Gita. India and the UK have been trying to strike a free trade deal, but talks reportedly stalled over fears among Sunak's party it could lead to more immigration. 
What the leadership is saying: Kenya's president, William Ruto, has yet to comment publicly on Mr Sunak's new position. 
What the press is saying: The Taifa Leo newspaper called Mr Sunak's rise another ""Barack Obama moment"". ""Sunak's case is nearly similar to that of former US President Barack Obama, who is an American citizen but has Kenyan roots as his father was born in Homa Bay County,"" Citizen Digital website said. Popular newspaper commentator Macharia Gaitho said ""Kenya has conquered the British Empire"". 
kground: Mr Sunak's father, Yashvir, was born in colonial Kenya to parents who had moved from Gujranwala, now in Pakistan, in the 1930s. Mr Sunak's father moved to the UK in the 1960s, where he became a GP. 
What the leadership is saying: European Council President Charles Michel said: ""Working together is the only way to face common challenges... and bringing stability is key to overcoming them.""
kground: Rishi Sunak is a Brexit supporter, but many EU leaders will have breathed a sigh of relief that he, not Boris Johnson, is taking over as prime minister, our Europe editor Katya Adler says. He is considered a pragmatist, and EU officials will want to work with him on rising energy costs, and the difficult issue of the Northern Ireland protocol, an important trading arrangement struck during Brexit talks.
During the August leadership contest, Mr Sunak said a trade war with the EU was not in the UK's interest. But finding compromise may be politically difficult for him, and Brussels fears he might shun working with the EU to protect his political support at home. 
What the leadership is saying: Irish PM Micheál Martin said he looked forward to working with Mr Sunak, ""on the important issues we face on these islands and globally"".  
What the press is saying: The Irish Times welcomed Mr Sunak's reputation for ""sensible politics"", but said he will face challenges, particularly with Brexit. It is not yet clear what his election means for the Northern Ireland protocol, the paper said. The Irish Independent said the new prime minister had been ""vindicated"" after the ""folly"" of Ms Truss's tax cuts. 
kground: Brexit remains one of the key issues between the UK and Ireland, with the Northern Ireland protocol now at the forefront of the agenda. Currently, goods being imported from Britain are checked before entering Northern Ireland. But the UK government previously called for a two-tier system, with checks only being conducted on goods destined for onward travel to the republic. 
Watch: Biden calls Sunak's rise to UK prime minister a ""ground-breaking milestone""
What the leadership is saying: At a White House event to mark the Hindu holiday of Diwali, President Biden described Mr Sunak's nomination as the UK's next prime minister a ""ground-breaking milestone"". The US president is holding back on formally congratulating Mr Sunak until he has met King Charles and been asked to form a government, as protocol dictates. 
What the press is saying: The New York Times lauds the ""record of representation"" built by the Conservatives in recent years, saying Mr Sunak's victory is another milestone in a history of promoting women and people of colour to prominent positions. The Washington Post also emphasised Mr Sunak's position as the first person of colour to be prime minister. The paper added that it would be ""the first time in history that the residents of Downing Street are richer than those of Buckingham Palace"". 
kground: Joe Biden has already said he would maintain a ""close relationship"" with whoever succeeded Ms Truss. He called her abandoned plans to cut taxes a ""mistake"", causing some eyebrows to be raised - US presidents tend to avoid commenting on allies' domestic policies. 
What the leadership is saying: China wants to ""advance ties with the UK"" under Sunak, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said. He added: ""We hope that we can work with the UK side on the basis of mutual respect and win-win co-operation and advance China-UK relations along the right track.""
What the press is saying: State-run CGTN highlighted reports that Mr Sunak will be the first prime minister to be richer than the monarch. ""His experience managing the UK's finances, and in particular his strongly-voiced opposition to Truss' disastrous plans for borrowing-funded tax cuts, prompted many in the party to view him as the safest choice,"" it said. Shanghai-based The Paper wrote that Sunak's victory ""would appear to signal a new achievement in his efforts to overcome racism in British politics"" but that it ""could not overshadow his other controversies"", mentioning the BBC video clip of him saying he had no working class friends in 2007, and his wife's previous non-domiciled status which excused her from paying some tax. 
kground: Rishi Sunak has favoured closer ties with China than his predecessor, and was criticised by Ms Truss for pursuing a trading relationship when chancellor. Ms Truss spoke of a need to avoid ""dependency"" on China, and during the summer leadership race said she would declare the country a ""threat"" to national security - a label already given to Russia. She also was reported to have privately supported declaring China's actions against Uyghur Muslims in Xinjang a genocide. 
What the leadership is saying: President Zelensky tweeted his congratulations to Mr Sunak. ""I wish you to successfully overcome all the challenges facing British society and the whole world today. I'm ready to continue strengthening the Ukraine-UK strategic partnership together!"" he said. Oleksandr Kornienko, the First Deputy Chairman of Ukraine's parliament, said he welcomed Mr Sunak as a ""colleague"". He added: ""Congratulations to the people of Great Britain on the fact that they have political stability again. After a short stage of turbulence.""
What the press is saying: The Glavkom website said both Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson would have been ""good news"" for Ukraine. Mr Sunak's remarks on Ukraine so far have been ""promising"", the website said, contrasting his statement in a debate that he does not want to meet Vladimir Putin with Liz Truss's readiness to speak to the Russian president. 
kground: UK policy towards Ukraine will not change under Mr Sunak. During the summer leadership contest, he said he would continue backing Ukraine, and make an early visit to Kyiv. But while Ms Truss promised to increase defence spending from 2% to 3% of national wealth - measured by gross domestic product - by 2030, Mr Sunak has said that target was ""arbitrary"" and ""not a plan"".
What the leadership is saying:  Russia sees no reason to expect relations with the UK to improve under Mr Sunak, the Kremlin said on Tuesday. 
What the press is saying:  All three main TV channels - the state's official Rossiya 1, state-controlled Channel One, and Gazprom-Media's NTV - have pointed out that Mr Sunak was elected unopposed.  TV's London correspondent Liza Gerson said this was an example of ""British democracy not for everyone"" - with Sunak voted in by so few that it amounted to a statistical ""margin of error"". Channel One correspondent Timur Siraziyev said Mr Sunak was toeing his party's line on Ukraine - ""to keep the conflict in Ukraine going as long as possible"" - and it was therefore ""not to be expected that with the advent of the new prime minister, relations between our countries will improve"".
kground: Russia-UK relations have soured even further since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. The UK responded with several rounds of sanctions, and it is one of the main backers of President Zelensky. The UK has also provided substantial military support to Ukraine. 
What the leadership is saying: Treasurer Jim Chalmers called Mr Sunak a great friend of Australia. ""I don't think it's insignificant a country like the United Kingdom has its first prime minister of colour,"" he said. 
What the press is saying: ""Sunak — one of the richest men in the House of Commons — may not be breaking the Tory tradition of elevating Oxford-educated elites, but his leadership will be historic. He will be Britain's first prime minister of colour.""
kground: Mr Sunak previously criticised the trade deal with Australia and New Zealand that Liz Truss negotiated as trade secretary, calling it ""one-sided"", and saying the UK ""shouldn't be rushing to sign trade deals as quickly as possible""."	/news/uk-63378673

He later revealed the star had since called and ""apologised profusely"".
Addressing the issue for the first time in public, Corden said of Mr McNally's claims: ""Because I didn't shout or scream, I didn't get up out of my seat, I didn't call anyone names or use derogatory language, I've been walking around thinking that I haven't done anything wrong.
""But the truth is I have made a rude, rude comment. And it was wrong. It was an unnecessary comment, it was ungracious to the server."" 
On the latest episode of his US show, Corden said his remarks had been ""in the heat of the moment"" but said he would ""apologise in person"" to the staff at Balthazar.
Corden said that after seeing Mr McNally's post, in which he accused Corden of being nasty to his staff on two visits in recent months, he had ""immediately"" contacted the restaurant owner.
""[I told him] how upset I was that anybody was hurt by anything that I had done and anything that I had said and we had a good talk,"" he said.
""He appreciated the call. I was happy that we got to clear the air. And I felt like we dealt with it privately... but by this point, the story was out there and more people were upset.""
Corden's explanation is a change in tone from comments he made in interview in the New York Times over the weekend.
He told the newspaper that he hadn't ""done anything wrong, on any level,"" adding that he felt ""so Zen about the whole thing. Because I think it's so silly"".
Mr McNally posted that Corden had visited his restaurant in June and been ""extremely nasty"" after he showed a hair to the manager after his main course - the implication being it was in his food.
A second run-in followed in November, the restaurant owner said. An omelette was the cause of the rudeness and Mr McNally accused Corden of yelling and again, ""being nasty"".
Corden told The Late Late Show that the second incident occurred when his wife was accidentally served a dish she would have had an allergic reaction to.
Corden showed a series of tweets reacting to his behaviour to The Late Late Show audience, telling them: ""I get it. I totally understand. I understand everybody getting upset and I accept everybody's opinion.
""I also hate, as I said to the owner that day, that I've ever upset anybody ever.
""It was never my intention. It just wasn't. I love that restaurant. I love the staff there.
""I hope I'm allowed in again one day so when I'm back in New York I can go there and apologise in person, which is something I will absolutely do.""
Mr McNally lifted his ban last week after receiving Corden's apology over the phone, posting on social media: ""Anyone magnanimous enough to apologise to a deadbeat layabout like me (and my staff) doesn't deserve to be banned from anywhere. Especially Balthazar.""
Corden announced in April that he was stepping down as host of The Late Late Show.
He is expected to depart in spring next year. "	/news/entertainment-arts-63384455

sports	Novak Djokovic: Serb lands in Australia after ban overturned	"Novak Djokovic has been welcomed back into Australia almost a year after he was deported over his Covid vaccine status.
Officials confirmed the 21-time Grand Slam champion, 35, had landed in the country for January's Australian Open.
Serb Djokovic, a nine-time Australian Open winner, had an automatic three-year visa ban overturned in November.
""I think that he is going to be again the player to beat,"" said Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley.
Last January, when Djokovic arrived in Australia for the 2022 tournament, Covid cases were skyrocketing and government rules required anyone entering the country to be vaccinated - unless they had a valid medication exemption.
Djokovic, who was detained by the Australian Border Force on entering the country and forced to stay at an immigration hotel, claimed he had obtained a medical exemption to defend his title without being vaccinated because he had recently recovered from Covid-19.
However, after 10 days of legal argument, the government ruled he did not meet the requirements for entry, so his visa was cancelled and he was automatically not allowed to return to Australia until 2025.
Djokovic's detention dominated the headlines in the build-up to the tournament, with crowds gathering outside his hotel campaigning for and against his eventual deportation.
Immigration Minister Andrew Giles - whose government came to power in May - overturned the ban last month and Djokovic said he was ""very happy"" on hearing the news.
xpect a backlash to the player's return and added: ""We welcome him back to Australia.
""I have a great deal of confidence in the Australian public. I have a lot of confidence that the fans will react how we hope they will react."" 
Djokovic, the world number five, said in November he was relieved to be able to return to Melbourne.
""[The] Australian Open has been my most successful Grand Slam,"" he added. ""I made some of the best memories there.
""Of course, I want to go back there, I want to play tennis, do what I do best, hopefully have a great Australian summer.""
Djokovic, who is one Grand Slam title behind Rafael Nadal's record of 22, is scheduled to play in the Adelaide International, beginning Sunday, with the Australian Open starting in Melbourne on 16 January. "	/sport/tennis/64101511
business	Fraud victims face call waiting lottery from banks	"Victims of fraud have no idea how long they will be stuck on the phone trying to report the crime to their bank, an investigation has found.
Average waiting times can range from 16 seconds to more than 30 minutes - depending on the bank, according to tests by the consumer group Which?.
More priority should be given to distressed victims, it said.
Co-operative Bank, which recorded the worst times in the exercise, said it had faced staff recruitment issues.
It added that retention of workers had also been a problem, as had sickness levels as a result of the pandemic.
Which? tested 11 banks and building societies by calling each of them 12 times at different times of the day over the course of a week in March. 
It dialled the phone numbers listed on each bank's website for reporting current account fraud - only some of which are dedicated hotlines. Monzo was excluded as it told people to use an in-app chat function. Six of 11 banks' helplines charged a fee, Which? said. 
wered fastest lasted only 10 seconds. That was made to First Direct - a bank designed to communicate with customers primarily over the phone. First Direct also had the shortest average call waiting time of 16 seconds.
One call to the Co-operative Bank went on for more than an hour before being answered. Its average waiting time was the longest, at 31 minutes and 40 seconds.
, across all the calls to all the banks, the testers from Which? had to wait for 10 minutes and 51 seconds before speaking to someone.
Rocio Concha, Which? director of policy and advocacy, said:  ""The feeling of being scammed is already stressful enough for victims, without having to wait long periods just to get through to your bank. 
""Victims are told to contact their bank immediately because every second counts. Some firms taking longer than half an hour to answer victims' calls shows the lack of support with which certain banks have treated fraud victims for far too long.""
Hutt is among those to have faced a long wait trying to deal with a potential fraud on his account.
71-year-old had spotted a suspicious transaction on his balance and called his bank to stop what looked like a fraudulent subscription.
After three or four attempts, including waiting for over an hour, he eventually got through. The web-chat system he tried directed him to the same phone number.
""I'm sure I wouldn't have had to wait for more than an hour if I was in a branch,"" he said.
A spokeswoman for UK Finance, which represents the banking industry, said: ""We know the devastating impact that fraud can have on victims and so firms always strive to respond to calls in good time. 
""Given fraud cases are often complex an appropriate amount of time needs to be spent on each call so customers get the right support, which can have an impact on call times.""
Hundreds of millions of pounds a year are stolen in so-called authorised push payment fraud - when victims transfer money to a business or organisation they believe to be genuine but is actually a con-artist.
Some victims have got their money back from banks, while others have lost out.
Proposed legislation in the Queen's Speech should mean there is a consistent approach to refunds in the future. It will be up to the Payment Systems Regulator to frame those rules, after banks were unable to do so between themselves.
At present, some banks have signed up to the 159 pilot scheme. It encourages customers to hang up from a phone call that might be a scam, for example one that asks for personal information or money, and to dial 159 to speak to their bank. 
Citizens Advice urges anyone who believes they are the victim of a scam to protect from further loss by resetting passwords, reporting the issue to their bank immediately - and possibly to the police on the 101 number - and checking if they are entitled to the money back. "	/news/business-61550686

Party members have differing views on how to achieve the emissions target by 2050.

technology	EE to block pirate music mobile sites and apps	"EE is to become the first UK mobile network to block access to pirate music websites.
Industry body the British Phonographic Institute (BPI) successfully petitioned the courts to block file-sharing site The Pirate Bay in 2012.
High Court subsequently ordered broadband providers, including EE, to block more than 70 websites which allow people to download music illegally.
EE now plans to extend this ban to its mobile network.
An EE spokesperson said: ""Historically the majority of piracy took place on fixed line networks, but as network speeds increase and content file sizes for music decreases, mobile networks are seeing a rise in piracy. EE believe in supporting content creators by combatting piracy across both our mobile and fixed networks.""
Vodafone, Three, and O2 have been approached for comment.
Online piracy costs the record industry £200m a year, the BPI says.
Kiaron Whitehead, a lawyer for the BPI, said: ""A quarter of people now connect to the internet over 3G, 4G and 5G rather than broadband and wi-fi.
""That growth brings with it the risk of increased music piracy.
""The operators of these pirate sites make millions of pounds a year, without a penny going to the creators of the music they exploit. 
""We are therefore pleased that EE - which was the first mobile network to launch 5G to the UK population - has now become the first mobile network to block pirate sites.""
But Chris Elkins, co-founder and chief business development officer at Muso, a data company measuring unlicensed demand for digital content, told BBC News combating piracy was about more than simply blocking websites. 
""One of the things we've found is there needs to be a combination of legal effort and site blocking,"" he said. 
""Website blocking is really important... it needs to become routine and more cost-effective, and part of the arsenal that all media companies can utilise.
""And the legal offer - such as Spotify - is an example of a really positive service that has engaged consumers.
""It's about enforcing, making sure the piracy is harder to find, and creating stronger and stronger legal offers that the audience can engage with."""	/news/technology-62123815
technology	Meet the BBC’s 'undercover voters' for the US midterms	"As US voters get ready to vote in the midterms, a number of recent news events are shaping their social media feeds - the raid on Trump's home in Mar-a-Lago as he's investigated for possibly mishandling documents, abortion bans, and debates about gun rights. For Americast and Newsnight, BBC's Disinformation and Social Media correspondent Marianna Spring is investigating what voters are recommended online at a turbulent time for US politics. 
I've created social media accounts belonging to five fake characters, who reflect views from across the political spectrum in the US. The people I created are based on data by a US think tank which defined types of voters after surveying more than 10,000 randomly selected US adults.
I've given each of them five profiles across Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter - with names and computer-generated photos. They are: Larry, the Faith and Flag conservative; Britney from the Populist Right; Gabriela, the less political Stressed Sideliner; Michael, the Democratic Mainstay; and Emma from the Progressive Left.
After just a week of running the accounts, Britney - the Populist Right Voter - has already been recommended and has encountered pages on Instagram and Facebook continuing to promote disinformation that Trump really won the 2020 election. She's also come across similar content on TikTok. False claims are sometimes accompanied by violent rhetoric in reference to Trump's opponents. 
In contrast, the accounts belonging to Michael - the Democratic Mainstay, and Emma - the Progressive Left voter, have been pushed memes celebrating the investigation into Trump and quizzing why this didn't happen sooner. 
Britney's feeds include suggestions that the recent raid on his home in Mar-a-Lago just confirms he was actually victorious and the State is out to get him. Several of these pages opt for phrases like ""Trump won"" rather than ""stop the steal"", which was the term used on social media ahead of the riots at the Capitol. 
riots - and the wave of false claims about fraudulent voting in their build-up - have marked a turning point in the US. Now, more than ever, there are questions about how misleading and harmful posts online could affect voters heading to the polls, and social media sites have made fresh commitments to tackle it.
BBC's experiment so far suggests those same false claims about ""ballot mules"" and ""ballot trafficking"" from the 2020 election continue to spread online. Britney has also come across other anti-Semitic conspiracies about sinister global plots - and been recommended conspiracy-inspired pages. 
kTok told the BBC, ""We take our responsibility to protect the integrity of our platform and elections with utmost seriousness."" 
It says it prohibits election misinformation, ""provides access to authoritative information through our Election Centre"" and works with independent fact-checking organisations. 
Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, says ""it has hundreds of people across more than 40 teams working on the midterm elections"", as well as ""robust measures in place to combat misinformation"". That includes partnerships with 10 fact-checking organisations in the US. 
Larry - the Faith and Flag conservative - has been recommended similar content about the raid on Trump's home, as well as repeated pages promoting guns and other weapons. 
However, the feed belonging to Emma - the Progressive Left voter - also featured more about influencer Andrew Tate, recently banned from Instagram and Facebook for promoting misogyny online. The videos on her feed rejoice his ban, whereas none of the other older voters have encountered anything similar. 
unt of Gabriella - the undecided voter - hasn't been exposed to much politics at all, whether Trump or Tate. Her profiles are generally apolitical and so, instead, her social media feeds are dominated by posts about her hometown of Miami, fashion, dance, and saving money during the cost of living crisis. 
rofiles are all informed by data from Pew Research Center, which defined nine different typologies of US voters who sit along the political spectrum after conducting a wide-ranging survey in 2021.
BBC has selected five of those nine types and based the characters on data about their demographic, age, interests and opinions on different political issues. The five types chosen aim to reflect a cross-section of the US electorate with a range of views and backgrounds. 
Democrat-leaning and Republican-leaning groups that the characters are based on offer insight into what the greatest proportion of active voters on the political right and left can be exposed to online. The more apolitical Stressed Sideliner type makes up relatively less of the electorate compared to all of the other right or left-leaning groups.
I'll be logging on regularly to each of the accounts for a similar period of time to like the kinds of posts they would, check what they've been recommended, and see where the social media algorithms take our characters. I use a VPN on each of the phones, so my location can be set to the US. 
According to research from Pew, around seven in 10 Americans use social media - and this is one of the only ways of interrogating the subjective social media worlds of different voters that we can't usually access. 
While it can't offer an exhaustive insight into what every US voter could be seeing on social media - and they don't have friends or followers - it gives us a snapshot into what different types of voters across the political spectrum are exposed to when they log onto their phones. 
re are a series of recent news events that are shaping some of the voters' social media feeds. The raid on Trump's home in Mar-a-Lago, as he's investigated for possibly mishandling documents. The Roe v Wade ruling that made abortion legal across the US was overturned. The war in Ukraine, debates about gun rights and a cost-of-living crisis across the world. 
r accounts are all private - and they don't comment or talk to anyone real. They just like, follow and join groups, pages and accounts as per their interests and recommendations. 
Here's an explanation of who they are and what they like. 
Larry is what is known as a Faith and Flag conservative. This group has the oldest voters according to Pew's research - with a third over 65. Larry, a retired insurance broker, is 71 years old. This group is also the least diverse, with the highest proportion of non-Hispanic white voters, as well as the highest share of male voters. 
What would Larry like on social media? He has very conservative values and has followed and liked pages that are pro-guns and the US Second Amendment. He is loyal first and foremost to the Republican party and whoever represents them, which most recently has been Donald Trump - and likes pages about this. Fox News is the main place this voter group goes for news, according to Pew's data. 
For him, religion is very important in public life. He is an evangelical protestant who is married to a woman and has grown-up children. He has followed several anti-abortion pages and groups.
He doesn't like the federal government having too much power. Instead, he's liked lots of groups and pages about his local area and community in Oneonta, Alabama. He has also followed several US army pages. 
Britney, 50 years old, is the Populist Right character. She votes Republican, but unlike Larry, she's much more critical of big business. She likes some posts on social media opposing billionaires and supporting higher taxes for big corporations. She also follows pages about unfounded conspiracies like the Great Reset and New World Order, which tap into the idea that the very rich are orchestrating a sinister global plot. 
She is very supportive of Trump - and the possibility he'll run for re-election in 2024. Her loyalties lie with him rather than the Republican party itself. 
Populist Right group is overwhelmingly white - but the 54% of voters who fall into this group are female. It is also one of the least highly educated groups with just two in 10 graduating from college. Recently-divorced Britney and her children live in Houston in Texas, where she works as a school secretary and takes part in parent groups online.
Half of this group opposed Covid-19 vaccines - so Britney likes and follows some anti-mask and anti-vaccine content on social media. Like Larry, she is also religious and follows many anti-abortion accounts and pages. Fox News is also where she gets her news, according to research - and it's the outlet she was recommended lots on Twitter when she first signed up. 
Gabriela, 44 years old, is a floating voter - and Pew's research dubs this group Stressed Sideliner. Her views vary and she's not really that interested in politics. She likes music, dance, fashion - and topics that are generally apolitical on social media. 
group is 56% women - and has the highest share of Hispanic voters compared to all the other groups. Gabriela lives with her husband and children in Miami, Florida, and likes and follows pages about her local area, as well as the Hispanic community there. 
About one in four Stressed Sideliners live in lower-income households. Gabriela has liked lots of groups and pages about saving money on monthly shopping. She is a nanny, so has also joined lots of parent groups and others advertising work. 
Her views on social issues vary. According to Pew's research, on abortion, banning guns, legalising marijuana and making university free, Stressed Sideliners align with Democrats. But she's more conservative on the death penalty and supportive of the police. She has liked some pro-choice content.
Michael, 61 years old, is part of the Democratic Mainstay group. This is the most diverse group, with the highest proportion of black voters at 26%. According to Pew's research, three quarters of this group are religious - and it has the highest proportion of black protestant voters. Michael really values faith and family. He's interested in pages linked to churches in his local area, as well as US and black history. 
He's been a committed Democrat for years. He likes lots of pages, groups and accounts linked to the party, as well as popular politicians like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Barack Obama. 
Democratic Mainstays are slightly older and have less formal education than other Democrat-leaning groups. Michael is a teacher in Milwaukee, Wisconsin - where he lives with his wife and kids. 
He is economically more liberal. On social media he follows various teaching unions and charities that help families make ends meet. But he is more moderate on other social issues and is pro-military. He prefers left-leaning news outlets, including CNN.
Emma is the most liberal of all the types - 48% of this group has received a university degree, and most of them are white. Emma attended university and lives in New York City with her girlfriend, where she is a graphic designer. The creative arts are very important to these voters, according to Pew's data. Emma follows accounts about art and film. 
group is made up of younger voters - with a third under 30. They are also the least religious of all of the groups. Emma is 25-years-old and an atheist. 
According to Pew, these voters are likely to get their political news from NPR and The New York Times - which are pages Emma follows. 
Progressive Left voters are very passionate about racial and gender equality - 88% judge there to be serious discrimination against black people. Emma follows lots of accounts in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. 
She is also pro-choice and passionate about the environment. Emma likes a variety of pages about intersectional feminism, women's marches and LGBTQI rights, including supporting the transgender community. She follows environmental activists - and she supports the legalisation of marijuana, liking several pages that promote this. 
Emma and Larry are both the most politically engaged according to Pew's research. They voted at the highest rate in the 2020 Presidential election, they post about politics online and they donate to campaigns too.

politics	Rishi Sunak: New PM a friend to Wales - top Welsh Tory	"""Hopefully it just gets better,"" one woman said in response to the news Rishi Sunak will be the UK's next prime minister
A senior Welsh Conservative has described the next Prime Minister Rishi Sunak as a ""friend of Wales"", who ""understands the challenges we face"".
He will take office in coming days, and Andrew RT Davies, the Tories' Senedd leader, urged the party's MPs to unite.
But the main Welsh opposition parties said he has ""no mandate"" and repeated their calls for a general election.
Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford urged Mr Sunak to ""work constructively"" with him in ""these difficult times"".
weeting in the moments after the appointment was confirmed, Mr Davies said: ""I know that colleagues in Westminster will realise the real need to come together to deliver for the people of Wales and the United Kingdom. 
""As a friend of Wales, Rishi understands the challenges we face, with high energy bills, high inflation, and household budgets being stretched to breaking point.
""I look forward to working with him to tackle those challenges.""
Mr Davies added that it was important to celebrate the UK's first British Asian and Hindu prime minister.
Former Conservative Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said the announcement ""ends the political uncertainty"".
Businesses and residents in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, reacted to the new occupant of 10 Downing Street.
Mary Caldwell, from The Deli on the Hill, said: ""I feel he is solid and he will help us through.
""We are very concerned - there's no question the high street is quieter. The higher luxury areas are suffering. 
""The small business is the backbone of Britain. We employ, they have money to spend.""
Omer Akca, owner of Gino's Tailoring, was hoping for the return of Boris Johnson as prime minister, but echoed Ms Caldwell's hope for business support.
He said: ""Maybe [Rishi Sunak] can help, I hope he's ok. Business is quiet, everywhere quiet.""
Hayley Morgan, owner of The Twisted Tree gift shop, added: ""I just want somebody to address the key issues: cost of living, energy.
""I don't want the deterioration of the high street. Here in Prestatyn we have worked hard to establish [it].""
However, Mike Hall, visiting Wales from Birmingham is not convinced after watching Mr Sunak's performance as chancellor.
He said: ""I wish him the best of luck getting everything straight, but I feel it's him giving stuff away that got us into this in the first place.""
Ethan Harvey, a Conservative Party member from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, told BBC Radio Wales Drive that he had voted for Liz Truss in the last leadership contest.
He said: ""She came in at a difficult time. It's about helping people now, through the winter, help them pay their bills. It's really important we do that, and party comes second.""
Edward Dawson, chair of Merthyr Tydfil Conservatives and regional chair for south east Wales, added: ""People who do need help, in Wales and elsewhere, cannot be left behind. 
""I've talked to Rishi. He understands that, he knows this is a key part of his job in the short term. Not that there won't be difficulties, and there will be upsets along the way.""
Labour shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said: ""No-one voted for this. It's time for a general election.""  
While First Minister Mark Drakeford tweeted his congratulations in Welsh to Mr Sunak, and added: ""The UK desperately needs a period of stability and cooperation to focus on the many challenges we face.
""I hope we're able to work constructively together to support people through these difficult times in a way that your predecessors didn't allow.""
Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, Liz Saville Roberts, said: ""The anti-democratic nature of the Westminster system has been laid bare for all to see. Rishi Sunak has no mandate, no legitimacy. Democracy demands a general election.
""Rishi Sunak's coronation may soothe the financial markets in the short term, but the Tory party is still riven with factions who will be jostling for the upper hand at critical votes.""
Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said: ""The problem is clearly not any single prime minister or minister, but the Conservative Party as an institution which continues to put its own wellbeing above that of the country's and is so internally divided it cannot hope to produce a well-functioning government.
""Rishi Sunak showed time and time again in his role as chancellor that he was out of touch with the struggles ordinary people faced, whether it's paying their heating bills or being able to access key public services. 
""The public has lost trust in the Conservatives and Sunak does not have a mandate from the people, we need a general election now to get us out of this perpetual chaos and give the country fresh hope.""
Mr Sunak will succeed Liz Truss seven weeks after she defeated him in the previous Tory contest, following her resignation just 45 days into her tumultuous premiership last week.
x-chancellor gained the support of more than half of Tory MPs, with Penny Mordaunt struggling to reach the 100 MP threshold.  
He will become the UK's first British Asian PM and, at the age of 42, the youngest in more than a century. 
Ms Mordaunt, who dropped out of the Tory leadership race in the final minutes before nominations closed, said Mr Sunak has her ""full support"". "	/news/uk-wales-63377294
entertainment	Mobo Awards: Little Simz and Knucks tie for best album prize	"Rappers Little Simz and Knucks have been named joint winners of the best album prize at this year's Mobo Awards.
It was the first-ever tie in the 25-year history of the awards, which celebrate black music and culture.
win was a further accolade for Simz' intensely personal Sometimes I Might Be Introvert, which won last month's Mercury Prize last month.
Knucks was honoured for his jazz-rap debut, Alpha Place, named after the London estate he grew up on.
Judges said ""both artists showed where British rap can go, both production-wise and lyrically"".
remony also saw R&B star Craig David and Chic legend Nile Rodgers win lifetime achievement awards.
On stage at London's Wembley Arena, David dedicated his award to his father, George.
""Thank you to my dad, who was part of the Windrush era,"" he said. ""He came over to this country and he experienced racism, he experienced being bullied... but he nurtured me and showed me love. 
""He always said to me, 'Never dim your light'. And I love you dad for that, because that's served me so well throughout my life.""
r's honour came 22 years after his first Mobo win, for best newcomer, in 2000.
""I feel the same way I did back then - just really thankful,"" he told BBC News.
""But I know that the bit in between, which we call life, has been the most beautiful thing - and I would never change it for the world.""
Rodgers, the New York musician whose credits include Madonna's Like A Virgin, David Bowie's Let's Dance and Beyoncé's Cuff It, said he had always felt at home in London.
""The UK has always supported me and always supported my efforts when sometimes in America racism played a part in my development,"" he said. ""I always say to people, I have been swimming upstream my entire life.""
He went on to close the show with a medley of his hits, from Chic's Le Freak to Daft Punk's Get Lucky.
Elsewhere at the ceremony, London rapper Central Cee made good on his 2021 best newcomer award, returning to the ceremony to pick up best male artist and video of the year, for his provocative street anthem Doja.
BBC Sound of 2022 winner PinkPantheress was named best female, recognising the home-spun, sample-heavy of  hits like Just For Me and Break It Off.
r's Mobos also featured two new categories - best alternative act and best dance/electronic act - in response to calls for the awards to diversify.
Jungle musician Nia Archives led the campaign, posting an open letter in April saying it was ""frustrating"" that the ceremony didn't represent ""black music in all its forms"".
When the new categories were announced, she was among the nominees - and ultimately won best dance/electronic artist.
""I weren't expecting that, I can't lie,"" said the Bradford-born musician. ""Jungle is music of black origin and I'm proud to be flying the flag for my community and my scene.""
Best alternative act went to grime-punk duo Bob Vylan, whose gripping second album The Price Of Life is a furious polemic about wealth inequality and the cost of living crisis.
""There's a lot of anger in it, but it's righteous anger,"" singer and guitarist Bobby Vylan told BBC News. ""If you look at the news on any given day, the people of Britain should be angry with what's going on.
""We're working-class musicians. We're on the ground, we're not removed from any of the struggle. We're here at an award show but we've got to pay our rent.""
Nigerian superstar Burna Boy claimed two prizes, winning best international and best African act; while D-Block Europe won best hip-hop.
Song of the year went to dancer-turned-musician Dreya Mac for her viral smash Own Brand (Baddie).
Best known for the line ""I ain't never been with a baddie"", her imminently-quotable earworm became a sensation on TiKTok last year, ultimately soundtracking more than eight million videos.
Knucks, aka north London rapper Ashley Nwachukwu, went into the ceremony with the most nominations - five in total.
Although the shared best album trophy was his only victory, the musician was happy with the result.
""It's definitely validating"" he told BBC News. ""I feel like I've been doing this for a long time, so to finally have people acknowledge all the effort I put in really feels good.""
He described his album as ""an origin story that shows where I came from and what kind of person I am"".
Kane Robinson - aka rapper Kano - won best performance in a TV show for his role as drug kingpin Sully in the Netflix drama Top Boy. 
Reflecting on how his life had changed since winning best newcomer at the 2005 Mobos, the star had some advice for his fellow musicians. 
""I just want to say to all artists that have other interests - you can do what you [expletive] want. 
""No boxes, no boundaries. Your artistry don't stop in one medium. If you're interested in something else, do it.""
BBC One will show highlights from the ceremony - including performances by Kojey Radical, Fireboy DML, Cat Burns and FLO - in a special programme next Wednesday, 7 December.

politics	Prince of Wales has no plans for investiture, Kensington Palace confirms	"Prince of Wales has no plans for an investiture, Kensington Palace has said.
William made his first visit on Wednesday to the Welsh Parliament since his father made him Prince of Wales.
King's decision triggered a debate about whether or not there should be a repeat of Charles' 1969 investiture in Caernarfon.
While there was support for that event at the time, it also faced protests.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said it ""easy to see"" why a different approach was being taken ""during tough times"".
Meanwhile the prince said he is supporting both England and Wales at the World Cup, following controversy over his support for the former.
Deputy presiding officer David Rees said William accepted a Welsh bucket hat during the visit.
William met the First Minister Mark Drakeford, Presiding Officer Elin Jones and party leaders.
He arrived at the Senedd by car and entered through a side-entrance for the meeting in Cardiff, which is free of the pomp or crowds of recent royal events in the capital.
Prince of Wales was given his title by the new King the day following the death of Queen Elizabeth II.
It was William's second official visit to the country as Prince of Wales, after he and the Princess of Wales visited Anglesey and Swansea in September.
role of Prince of Wales has faced criticism - the Plaid Cymru Senedd group said the title of has ""no formal place or responsibility within Welsh life"", following their meeting with the royal.
But the visit was welcomed by the Welsh Conservatives.
Kensington Palace said the meeting aimed to ""deepen his understand of the issues and opportunities of greatest importance to the Welsh people"".
BBC Wales was told that the prince understands he is at the start of a long period of association with Wales' political system, and was keen to express his desire to deepen the trust and respect of people of Wales over time.
He planned to tell them that there are no formal plans for an investiture ceremony, aware of the political controversy that surrounded the event in 1969.
Kensington Palace said an investiture is ""not on the table"".
ure ceremony for the then-Prince of Wales took place in Caernarfon Castle in 1969
On Wednesday the prince was given a brief tour of the Senedd building and debating chamber led by the Llywydd, Elin Jones.
He met politicians from the four parties represented in the Senedd - Welsh Labour, the Welsh Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Liberal Democrats.
William concluded his visit by meeting the Welsh Youth Parliament.
meeting follows controversy about his support for the English football team, ahead of the World Cup.
On Tuesday evening, Welsh actor Michael Sheen questioned whether William's role as Prince of Wales was appropriate given his support of the England football team.
Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru MS, said on Twitter: ""He's an Englishman, so of course he supports England,"" but added: ""I'm clear there shouldn't be a Prince of Wales. But this football thing must be embarrassing for him too. Just highlights the nonsense.""
After Elin Jones raised the World Cup group match between Wales and England, he said: ""I'm telling everyone I'm supporting both, definitely. I can't lose.
""I've supported England since I've been quite small, but I support Welsh rugby and that's my kind of way of doing it.
""I happily support Wales over England in the rugby.
""I've got to be able to play carefully with my affiliations because I worry otherwise if I suddenly drop England to support Wales then that doesn't look right for the sport either. So I can't do that.""
Prince Charles, as he was then, was 20 when he was crowned at the investiture ceremony at Caernarfon Castle.
While it had no formal constitutional role, the ceremony presented Charles with the symbols that marked him as Prince of Wales: the sword, coronet, ring, rod and mantle.
In addition to the 4000 guests present in the castle, 19 million saw it at home and another 500 million watched around the world.
was watched by a TV audience of millions. Street parties were held across the country, but it polarised opinion in Wales amid a backdrop of protests and bombings.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""I think it's a decision for him to make. He will have thought carefully about it. I always believed myself that taking 1969 as a template for Wales in 2022 would not be a reliable guide to the best way to proceed."" 
""In tough times, I think everybody who is in a position of making decisions about how public money is spent, and the sort of messages that it sends to the wider population, will be thinking hard about that and I think it's very easy to see why the prince himself, and those who advise him, will come to the conclusion that a different approach is the right one to take in 2022.""  
King Charles' decision to make William Prince of Wales triggered discussion among some politicians over whether an investiture would be suitable.
But in a Walesonline article, written in October, the presiding officer said investitures ""should be consigned"" to the 20th century.
Plaid Cymru MS Elin Jones, who is among those meeting William on Wednesday, wrote her republicanism remained ""unshaken"" following her involvement in the events marking the death of Queen Elizabeth at the Senedd and at St James' Palace, for the Accession Council.
In September Kensington Palace said there were no plans for Prince William to have an investiture ""anything like his father had"" as Prince of Wales.
Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price were among those who met William on Wednesday.
Mr Davies said it was a ""pleasure to welcome the Prince of Wales"".
He added: ""After the King and Queen's recent visit, it is fantastic to see the bonds between Wales and our Royal Family becoming stronger still. There is a huge amount of goodwill towards the Prince and Princess in Wales, and I know there will always be a warm welcome for them whenever they visit.
A spokesperson on behalf of the Plaid Cymru group said: ""The Plaid Cymru group have been clear that we believe the title of the ""Prince of Wales"" to be antiquated and out of touch with a modern, equal, and democratic Wales.""
""Furthermore, given the exacerbating cost of living crisis and the historical sensitives, an investiture should not take place in any circumstance - nor should any service that could be interpreted as a lesser form of an investiture,"" the group said.
It added: ""We look forward to seeing the Prince use the platform he has already, that isn't necessarily reliant on him being Prince of Wales, to promote good causes and positive change across Wales and the world including tackling child poverty, inequality, and the climate crisis.""
Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds, said: ""It was an honour to welcome His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to the Senedd this morning and I am extremely grateful for him taking the time to have a one-on-one meeting with me.
""It is very clear that His Royal Highness cares deeply about the people of Wales and it was fantastic to hear of his commitment to mental health causes, particularly his interest in mental health provisions for rural areas and farmers."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63635177

business	Pound hits new 37-year low as retail sales slide	"und has fallen to a new 37-year low against the US dollar after figures showed UK retail sales fell sharply in August as the rise in the cost of living continued to hit households.
rger-than-expected drop in sales volumes of 1.6% prompted fresh concerns over the state of the economy.
Sales across all retail sectors fell in August as households cut back in the face of rising prices.
One analyst suggested the figures showed the UK is already in recession.
Sterling fell more than 1% against the dollar to $1.1351 at one point, its lowest since 1985, following the release of the retail sales figures. The pound recovered later to climb above $1.14. 
und has been falling against the US currency for most of the year, partly due to the strength of the dollar. A weak pound means Brits travelling overseas will find their spending money will not stretch as far.
mes at a time when UK inflation, which is the rate at which prices rise, is running at a near 40-year high, despite slipping to 9.9% from July's 10.1%.
Bank of England has predicted the UK will fall into recession towards the end of this year and it is expected to keep increasing interest rates in a bid to curb inflation.
Olivia Cross, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said August's retail sales figures backed up the consultancy's view that the UK economy is ""already in recession"".
A recession is defined by the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods. 
""Retail sales will probably continue to struggle as the cost of living crisis hits harder in the coming months,"" Ms Cross said.
""But nonetheless the Bank of England will still have to raise interest rates aggressively.""
Higher prices, along with upcoming energy bill rises in October, have led households to tighten their belts when it comes to spending.
government announced the Energy Price Guarantee last week to help people with energy bills. The support will see annual energy bill for a typical household capped at £2,500 for two years.
rgy bills were set to rise to £3,549 a year and even higher in 2023, before the government intervened.
Ms Cross, of Capital Economics, said that because of the intervention, any recession would be ""smaller and shorter"" than it had expected previously.
Martyn Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the government support  ""should ease both the income squeeze and lift consumers' sentiment, suggesting the outlook for retailers isn't as gloomy as could have been the case"".
""However, real household incomes are still on course for a significant fall over the next 12 months or so,"" he added.
government is expected to set out the estimated cost of plans to cap energy prices in a ""mini-Budget"" next Friday, as well as tax cuts pledged by Prime Minister Liz Truss in a bid to boost the economy.
Sterling's fall to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar today is not isolated. The pound also hit its weakest level against the euro for nearly a year and a half.
So while the big picture movement is strength in the US dollar, there continues to be specific additional pressure on the pound sterling in international markets.
morning's trigger was far weaker than expected retail sales figures. But markets await next Friday and the extent of borrowing required for the government's energy plan and tax cuts.
urozone too is heading for recession, but there is little comfort in such company.
risk is that a weaker currency, makes imports of essentials, from energy to food, more expensive, prolonging the period of high inflation. And if the UK's nearest trading partners are also in recession, exporters will not see significant benefit from a weaker pound.
fall in retail sales continues the slide since the summer of 2021, when all Covid restrictions were removed, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The drop seen in August was the largest month-on-month fall since December 2021.
Sales of food, online, non-food and fuel all fell in the month, the ONS said.
Supermarkets' sales volumes also fell by 0.9% in August, but alcohol and tobacco sales rose by 6.3%.
""Feedback from retailers suggests that consumers are cutting back on spending because of increased prices and affordability concerns,"" the ONS said.
Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, said people were ""clearly thinking hard about what they spend their money on"".
""It's just not stretching as far as it used to, and essentials have to come first. But even essentials are costing more and with the spectre of unmanageable fuel bills looming large people did the only thing they could, cut back,"" she said.
According to the ONS, department stores saw a large drop in sales in August - 2.7% - while sales in clothing shops fell by 0.6%.
""Big ticket purchases are being put off and that's unlikely to change in the coming months,"" said AJ Bell's Ms Hewson.
On Thursday, John Lewis revealed that while its shopper numbers were higher than last year, customers were spending less and avoiding buying as many ""big ticket"" items.
rtment store and its supermarket chain Waitrose reported a loss of £99m for the first half of its trading year. Waitrose said it sales were down 5% on last year, with basket sizes shrinking by ""nearly a fifth"".
Food prices have been increasing around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been one of the main factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills.
Meanwhile, the proportion of retail sales online fell to 25.7% in August from 26.3% in July, but the figure remains significantly above pre-pandemic levels. "	/news/business-62923994

business	Londonderry city deal: Council seeks further funding	"Derry and Strabane councillors have agreed to write to the UK Treasury requesting additional funding for its city deal at a meeting on Tuesday. 
It comes after councillors were informed plans may have to be scaled back in light of inflation. 
uncil will also seek support from the Department of Finance due to ""construction inflation and further financial pressures"".
In the deal, funding of £250m will be invested in the region over 15 years.
It has hopes of creating 7,000 jobs and is the largest single investment made in the region with the potential to add about £210m a year to the area's economy.
major projects are proposed within the deal, with a focus on health and life sciences and digital industries.
At Tuesday night's meeting, Derry City and Strabane District Council chief executive John Kelpie told councillors the difficulties facing the city deal projects mean their benefits ""will be reduced"".
Mr Kelpie said progressing other major projects such as university expansion and infrastructural projects in parallel with the city deal was always deemed as important, but inflationary costs were an issue.
Some of the projects proposed in the deal include:
Speaking at the meeting, DUP cllr Maurice Devenney said costings were now ""a lot greater than expected"" and asked what those involved in Belfast city deal are doing ""to balance their books around budgets"".
SDLP cllr Brian Tierney added that the letter to the Treasury should reflect that the project was always intended to be a partnership and the council were ""never the sole carriers of this"". 
He added: ""It's not fair that because the prices go up, this council and the citizens of this district have to carry the can. If there are difficulties financially, all of the partners have to come together to sort out these issues. 
""The only way we can sort them out is by re-jigging the projects. Any response to the inflationary costs has to be met by the British government."" 
An update report by the council cited the ""growing scale and impact of increasing construction, materials and energy costs and inflation due to current national and global economic circumstances"".
It stated: ""The overall consequence of the above is that, at present, cost estimates for almost all of the projects as envisaged at Strategic Outline Case stage and developed since, are currently projected to be very considerably in excess of the available funding.""
report suggested solutions will include ""a range of considerations such as a reduction in complexity to some of the projects, mitigation of site specific issues highlighted through initial design development which have led to increased cost projections, adjustments to design and specifications etc and application of additional budget if possible by individual project partners""."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-foyle-west-63801500
health	NHS ambulance trust lost 12k hours to handover delays in one week	"An ambulance trust says more than 12,000 hours were lost in handover delays in one week.
South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SWASFT) said the figure from September was the ""highest level of resource hours lost in a single week"" in its history.
In 2020, the trust was losing less than 500 hours-a-week to handover delays.
SWASFT has now released plans which aim to ""significantly"" reduce delays as some waiting times begin to come down.
A spokesperson for the trust said its staff ""strive every day to give their best"" but its performance had not returned to pre-pandemic levels, partly due to handover delays at emergency departments. 
""We are working with our partners in the NHS and social care, to do all we can to improve the service that patients receive,"" they added.
report, published by the trust on Thursday, comes as thousands of ambulance workers across England and Wales are set to go on strike on Wednesday in a dispute about pay.
In 2020, SWASFT was able to deliver Category 2 mean response times of less than 30 minutes. 
Category 2 two calls are judged ""urgent"" and the mean response target is 18 minutes for all trusts.
But in the week commencing 26 September, the response times to these calls was almost two hours.
rust said there was a ""close correlation between ambulance hours lost and response times"".
SWASFT - which serves 5.5 million people - said there had been ""some improvements seen across October and November in comparison to the peak position seen at the end of September"".
In a bid to improve on this, the trust's commissioners have shared steps to reduce the weekly time lost to handover delays to around 2,600 hours a week by March 2023.
would ""still be significantly higher than historic levels, but a substantial improvement on the current position,"" the report said.
Areas that have already improved include Gloucestershire, which has seen mean Category 2 response times on certain days fall close to 25 minutes, compared to over an hour at their peak.
rust said it was ""placing more ambulances on the road than ever before"".
It is also recruiting for call takers for its emergency operation centres and is ""continuing to work hard on triage to reduce the number of patients we take to hospital,"" the trust said.

health	Londonderry: Future of Shantallow GP practice in doubt	"A Londonderry GP practice is at risk of closure after it handed its contract back to the Department of Health.
rtment said it was working to ensure an alternative service is put in place for the patients who attend the Racecourse Medical Group practice.
It confirmed that the department would retain the contract to deliver services for the next six months.
A recruitment process would now begin to put other arrangements in place, the department have said.
""Patients at the practice do not need to take any action,"" the department told BBC Radio Foyle. 
It will now be writing to all practice patients in the Shantallow practice to keep them informed as the process begins.
It is understood GPs at the Racecourse Road practice in Shantallow have decided to hand the contract to the strategic planning and performance group (SPPG) ahead of the retirement of a partner.
""The news that the management of the Racecourse Medical Group have handed back the contract is causing extreme concern for people in this area,"" Social Democratic and Labour Party councillor Brian Tierney said. 
""People have built relationships with the staff who provide an excellent standard of care and people in this community would be devastated to see it close.
""While the surgery will continue to operate as normal for at least the next six months, we need to see urgent action from the Department of Health to find new management so that it can continue to provide services to people in this area.""
move comes as one of Northern Ireland's largest GP practices, Maple Healthcare in Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh, is at risk of closure after its operator handed its contract back to the department.
On Friday, two surgeries in Ballymena also indicated that they intended to resign affecting about 7,000 patients.
""It is very worrying when we hear it in specific areas, it's worrying when we hear it happening right across Northern Ireland,"" the British Medical Association (BMA) said.
Dr Alan Stout from the organisation said more and more practices were ""really struggling to cope, struggling to keep doors open, struggling to pay staff and also struggling to keep up with demand"".
""We are hearing far too frequently from all areas that practices are simply saying that they can't deal with it anymore and are handing back their contracts,"" he added. 
Dr Stout said as soon as a GP practice handed its contract back the ""clock starts ticking"".
""In most cases it will be six months until a contract is actually advertised after it has been handed back,"" he said.
""Everybody will then try their best to get a new contractor, like a new GP, or it might be an agreement with other practices... or worst case scenario patients will then be allocated to other practices.""
Across Northern Ireland, the number of GP practices has fallen by just under 9% in eight years according to Department of Health Figures.
Belfast - Flax Medical Centre, Belfast, County Antrim
Northern - Ballymena Family Practice, Ballymena, County Antrim
South Eastern - Priory Surgery, Holywood, County Down

It must also ""continue to act to recruit to vacant roles across the organisation,"" and ""ensure staff have time to complete training"".
rust was also told it ""should"" ensure all patients records were completed in full, consider an upgrade of some wards and continue to work with system partners to discharge patients appropriately.
Steve Williamson, chief executive of the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust, said since the inspection almost 40 additional registered nurses had been appointed as well as more than 20 healthcare support workers. 
He said: ""Improving our staffing levels will help to free up time for mandatory and specialist training and to support our ward leaders in nurturing open and supportive cultures within their teams.

health	Long Melford fireworks cancelled after mortar bombs discovery	"A fireworks display had to be cancelled after three suspected mortar bombs were found in the grounds of a stately home.
Suffolk Police said a bomb disposal team from Colchester was called to Melford Hall, in Long Melford, on Wednesday.
Andrew Hagger, from the Suffolk Big Night Out, said he was ""gutted"" the show would not go ahead - but safety had to come first.
One device was found by a detectorist checking manhole covers, he said.
Melford Hall is a Grade I listed, National Trust property and dates from the 16th Century. 
Mr Hagger, events administrator for the charity Project Seven, said the event was last held in 2019 and had been cancelled three times due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
He said it last raised about £20,000 and the funds benefitted about 51 organisations. 
""I'm gutted, a lot of different organisations put in a lot of hard work and now won't get a donation,"" he said.
All tickets would be refunded and everyone's safety was ""paramount"" he added. 
He said he hoped it would go ahead in the same location next year. 
Suffolk Police said it was called at 16:15 GMT on Wednesday and the bomb squad arrived at 18:20. 
No evacuations took place and at 00:42 GMT the team left with the devices, to dispose of them safely, it added.

politics	Jeremy Hunt: Cut energy use to stop Putin 'blackmail'	"Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said people should cut their energy use to stop the UK being ""blackmailed"" by people like Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
Mr Hunt said ""in the end everyone is going to have to take responsibility for their energy bills"" and consider how to cut their consumption. 
government has extended support with energy bills until April 2024, but at a less generous level than now. 
It has set out a ""national ambition"" to cut energy use by 15% by 2030. 
Appearing in front of the Commons Treasury Committee, the chancellor said households could save themselves around £500 in the years to come if they hit that target and people ""need to change their behaviour"". 
In his Autumn Statement last week, Mr Hunt said the government would continue to help households with energy bills but from April the support would be less generous. 
It means the annual bill for a typical household will rise to £3,000 in April, up from the current figure of £2,500. 
Without government support a typical household would have paid £4,279 from January, regulator Ofgem said.
most vulnerable households will also get additional cost-of-living payments. 
Mr Hunt told MPs on the Treasury Committee: ""We will always be there to help poorer households, the way we do that will change.
""But for most people we need you to play your part in reducing our energy dependency.""
He added: ""We are saying to people that in the end everyone is going to have to take responsibility for their energy bills and they're going to have to think about how they're going to reduce their energy consumption.
""Because it is a national mission to make sure that we can't be blackmailed by people like Putin when they do things that interrupt international energy supplies.""
Mr Hunt said the household energy bill support scheme would cost £80bn this year and ""possibly around half that next year"". 
In the long run he warned ""we're going to need everyone to help us crack this problem if we're not going to have a huge additional burden on taxpayers"".
""That isn't just at a national level but that's for every household,"" he said. 
""We think that the £500 that we're offering to help people save next year, at current gas prices, if people do the 15%, they could save that £500 themselves in the amount they pay in the years that follow. 
""So we're trying to help people to help themselves. We're giving them a cushion this year and next. But we do need people to change their behaviour.""
But shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband said it was ""shameful that this government is waiting three years to start a proper home insulation programme"". 
He said Labour's plan for a publicly owned renewable energy company would ""bring down bills once and for all"" and ""take back control of our energy"".

technology	Emergency text averted possible California power cuts	"An emergency text message helped to prevent possible blackouts in the state of California on Tuesday. 
message asked residents to limit energy use for three hours to cut the risk of power cuts being implemented.  
California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO), said it ""saw an immediate and significant drop"" in the use of power after the text was sent. 
rt was issued after record temperatures put pressure on the state's electrical grid.
message, called a flex alert, was created by Cal-ISO to encourage users to conserve electricity when energy supply is at capacity. 
xts are sent out in advance so that preparations can be put in place. 
Some of the suggestions include setting thermostats to 25C (77F), and to avoid using kitchen appliances like ovens, kettles and microwaves. 
During hours of the alert, people are encouraged to pre-cool their homes and adjust blinds and drapes so that windows are covered.
Emma Hill, principal lecturer in energy and environmental management at Coventry University, said the messaging system appeared to have an impact. 
""There seems to be a correlation between the text being sent out and a reduction in demand for electricity,"" she said. 
She told the BBC that one of the reasons for this may be because people will not want potentially to be affected by power outages for longer periods of time.
""If you have very high demand in very high temperatures, when your electricity production is low, you risk damaging the equipment, like the transformers and the overhead lines, and they take time to repair,"" she said.
rt targeted 24 counties, which included Los Angeles and the Bay Area, because of high population and high air conditioning use. 
One Californian took to Twitter to explain the actions he took. 
Ms Hill believes that the UK is more resilient to situations like this.
""Ten years ago, UK network operators such as the National Grid and smaller disruption network operators had to assess the climate change risk to all of the systems.
""Due to that assessment, plans were made to manage that risk through damage management, communication or through improving the technology,"" she said. 
A National Grid Electricity System Operator spokesperson told the BBC: ""There are established mechanisms in place for communicating in an emergency.
""Due to the nature of these emergency communications and procedures we do not comment on the specifics of how these work."""	/news/technology-62832775
technology	London homicides driven by drugs and social media, study finds	"Drugs, missed mental health sessions and social media usage are factors driving homicides, a study has found.
London Violence Reduction Unit's (VRU) report analysed police data to better understand the causes of murder and manslaughter.
Last year, there was a record number of teenage killings in the capital, despite a national Covid-19 lockdown.
Each homicide costs the police and criminal justice system an estimated £800,000, the report claims. 
London's homicide rate means it would have an annual cost of about £120m. 
Established by the London mayor's office, the VRU study by the behavioural insights team aimed to find a framework for experts, including the police, to deliver early and targeted interventions.
Following an analysis of 50 homicides, it found:
will now use the framework to analyse another 300 cases with a view to it potentially being used more routinely in the capital.
Met Police Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, has previously said he wanted to bring the number of homicides in London down to below 100 a year, from 130. 
report from the Mayor's Violence Reduction Unit suggests police are only one part of the solution. 
re are recommendations for other agencies and policy makers too, including monitoring when someone stops engaging with mental health support and providing better guidance for young people who are being targeted on social media. 
report also highlights the gaps in the data recorded on homicides and makes recommendations for the police on how that can be improved. 
Gang violence, for example, is an area where researchers say there's not enough specific information about how drugs or social media are involved, or the relationships or nature of the conflict. 
Researchers say the clues are often there, but improving the data will make it easier to spot patterns and see where current provision and policy need to be improved.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""If we are to continue reducing violence in London, it's crucial that we identify more opportunities to intervene early because I firmly believe that violence is preventable, not inevitable.""
Lib Peck, director of VRU, said: ""The foundation of the VRU's approach to tackling violence is to build an evidence base for what works and what doesn't.""

business	No plans for windfall tax on electricity producers	"Boris Johnson has no plans to introduce a windfall tax on the profits of electricity firms before he steps down as prime minister, his spokesman said.
government said in May that oil and gas companies would be taxed an additional 25% for the next 12 months to help households with rising bills.
But the PM's spokesman said such a policy wouldn't be extended to electricity producers.
Shares in energy firms Centrica and SSE rose 3% each after the announcement.
government introduced a new tax on energy firms in May, known as the Energy Profits Levy, in a bid to raise around £5bn.
It came after BP and Shell both reported big profit increases as global oil and gas prices surged following increases in demand driven by the relaxing of Covid restrictions around the world, and also because of supply concerns after Russia - a major exporter of fossil fuels - invaded Ukraine.
It is hoped the windfall tax - a one-off tax that is imposed by a government on a company - on UK oil and gas producers could be used to help households seeing rising energy bills bite into budgets.
But asked on Monday whether the windfall tax would be extended to electricity generators, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""We would not seek to make any new policies or major fiscal decisions. 
""So there's no plans to do that.""
kesman said the government would ""continue to evaluate the scale of the profits and consider appropriate steps"", but there was ""no plans to introduce or extend that to that group"".
BBC has contacted the Treasury for comment.
Labour has called on the government to consider ""backdating"" its current Energy Profits Levy to January to raise ""extra tax revenue"" from oil and gas firms.
Shadow Treasury minister James Murray claimed including the extra months could raise an extra £1.9bn, which it urged the government to ""put towards removing VAT on domestic energy bills for the rest of this year"".
mestic energy bills could hit more than £3,300 a year this winter, according to the latest forecasts, having already increased £700 annually in April.
A set of government payments to help with bills starts to be paid next week. The government has said all UK households will receive a £400 discount on their fuel bills, while people on benefits will get an additional £650.
But Labour's Mr Murray said a total of £200m of public money would go towards people with multiple properties as the energy support package for households was ""cobbled together"" at the last minute.
""That is not fair. That is not a good use of public money,"" he added.
windfall tax could also hit electricity generators, including renewable energy operators, was first reported by the Financial Times.
Sources who were close to the Treasury - as they considered how to impose a windfall tax on such producers - pointed out that renewable and nuclear energy generators have also enjoyed bumper profits as electricity prices surged. They also enjoyed extra profits as they are not dependent on expensive gas to produce power.
But energy firms warned that an attempt to extend a windfall tax to renewable energy could destroy investor confidence ahead of key auctions for licences to develop new wind and solar projects.
f one of the UK's biggest investors in renewables previously said his profits from renewable energy generation were in the low hundreds of millions for a whole year, compared to the £7bn made by Shell and the £5bn made by BP in the first three months of 2021 alone."	/news/business-62121228
sports	Scottish Curling to review selection policy after Team Mouat call for change	"Scottish Curling is to revise its selection policy for major events after Olympic silver medallists Team Mouat were not selected for next month's men's World Championship.
Bruce Mouat's rink urged ""robust and transparent change"" after their successful appeal was overturned.
Ross Paterson's rink, who won the Scottish Championship, had their place confirmed after a counter appeal.
m Mouat took silver at the Worlds last year in Canada.
But Team Mouat were not present at the Scottish Championships last month as it clashed with their return from the Winter Olympics in Beijing.
Bruce Crawford, Scottish Curling chief executive, said a ""fair and balanced"" selection process was carried out by the seven-person panel - three of whom have votes - but accepted improvements could be made.
urrent selection criteria includes results and performance at the 2022 Scottish Championships, international tournaments, previous performance at major events and readiness to make the play-offs.
""We acknowledge there can be improvements to ensure there is greater clarity for future policies,"" Crawford told BBC Scotland.
""So we will engage with athletes, coaches and members to ensure that the next selection policy is better than the current one.
""We'll be making representations to the World Curling Federation to see whether the World Championships that follow the Olympics can be slightly later in the year. That would help alleviate some of this pressure.
""We'll identify whether it is a better priority for the teams that go to the Winter Olympics to have that as their focus for that season, and for other teams to be given the opportunity to prove themselves on the world stage in a year when it is not an Olympic qualification year.""
On Team Mouat's criticism, Crawford added: ""I'm quite happy that they can make that statement. I'm not entirely in agreement with all of the things they've stated, but I think that many of those things will be cleared up in our review.
""We are blessed with three very good teams who are all roughly top 30 in the world rankings, with two in the top 10. So we're in a really strong position as a sport on the men's side.
""And we've got Olympic gold medallists on the women's side, and a different team on the women's side that is going to the World Championships."""	/sport/winter-sports/60766925
entertainment	Edinburgh Fringe: The viral comedy stars leaping from TikTok to the stage	"A number of new comedians amassed huge followings on TikTok during the pandemic. Now some are trying to convert viral fame into on-stage success by performing live at the Edinburgh Fringe.
kTok has emerged as a major force in comedy, by letting anyone share short, funny videos. The company is even sponsoring Edinburgh's annual comedy festival and hosting a virtual stage this year.
While social media isn't likely to replace stand-up, it has allowed a new generation of budding comedy stars to bypass the traditional routes to make their names.
But can the online sensations cut it in front of a live audience? Here, four of the biggest TikTok comedy acts who are performing at Edinburgh this month talk about becoming viral stars, taking to the stage - and whether the two can exist together.
In the olden days (ie a few years ago), a comedian at Edinburgh would hope to be spotted by an agent or TV producer who might one day be able to help them build a global fanbase. In the age of TikTok, performers like Christian Brighty can do it themselves in a few months.
""I'm going to tour America next year - which is an obscene, ridiculous idea,"" says Brighty, 28, from Cambridgeshire. ""I'm an alternative comic who, in 2019, was doing shows in dingy pub basements where I think Covid began. And I now have enough people to go and take my show to America. That's insane.""
Just under half of his 430,000 TikTok followers are in the US, and it's easy to imagine his riotous and knowing parodies of lusty period dramas going down well in the post-Bridgerton era. He joined the platform while furloughed during lockdown, posting a video a day for a month.
""It was a safe enclosed space to be creative, to experiment, to fail,"" he says. ""There are no repercussions for posting a bad video because no-one will see it. But if you post a good one, then millions of people might see it. I learned so much in that time.""
His first video to break the million mark was inspired by watching Poldark with his girlfriend's family. He has gone on to establish regular, silly characters - a romantic poet, a highwayman with a hobbyhorse, and a running story that sends up the allure of the archetypal aloof hero.
Forcing himself to make lots of TikToks honed his joke writing and quality control, he says. ""And it's made me become a better live performer, without a doubt.""
His Edinburgh show Playboy, co-written with Amy Greaves, centres on another alter-ego, Lord Christian Brighty, a cross between Mr Darcy from Pride and Prejudice and Blackadder's Lord Flashheart.
""You can't just take what you do on TikTok and put it in front of an audience live. It won't work,"" he says. 
""I describe them as siblings because they require different sensibilities. There's stuff in the [live] show that's far too slow for TikTok, because on TikTok you need a joke immediately, it needs a strong visual, and the idea needs to be at the header. Whereas you can't really do that on stage.""
ge show is more fully-formed and is ""the more authentic version of me"", he says. It was praised by The Telegraph, which said: ""An amusing 10-second video doesn't always translate to a good hour in the theatre, but in this case it indisputably has.""
Abi Clarke was ""very new"" to stand-up after spending a year doing low-key shows on the circuit before the pandemic hit. By the time the lockdowns finally ended, she emerged with hundreds of thousands of online fans. She now has 840,000 followers on TikTok and 360,000 on Instagram.
""Before, I was able to be anonymous and if a gig went bad, I'd just disappear and think, no-one's going to remember anyway,"" she says. ""Whereas now, there's more pressure there. Quite often people in the audience do know who you are or have come specifically for you.""
Some have even turned up wearing her merch. But on stage, Clarke is still taking things slowly.
She's not doing the standard solo hour-long show at Edinburgh, instead being one of four new comics on the bill at the Pleasance venue's prestigious Comedy Reserve night. ""I'm still in training,"" she says.
""If you see someone with a large social media following, a lot of people think you're the same as the comedians they see on telly. They're like, 'Well, you're a famous comedian'. But no, any comedian you see on TV has probably been going at least six years. And I've been going since 2019, with a two-year pandemic in the middle with no live performing.""
She found success online with shrewdly-observed, shareable sketches like If Cats Were Human and If Dogs Were Human, and skits about office gossips Jill and Tracey, and life inside Asos HQ. With their quick edits, multiple characters and maximum running times of a minute, they are very different from her stand-up routine.
""They really don't bleed into each other a lot to be honest. I'd say only twice I've written [live] material and written a sketch about the same thing.""
Her live routine is also ""a lot ruder"", she says. ""You get to be a bit naughtier on stage, whereas I think on the internet things can get taken out of context or people who speak different languages don't understand you're joking. So I think you've got to be very wholesome online. You've got to be your chirpy self.
""But on stage I get to show all sides of me, which is really fun because you work to get them [the audience] to like you at the start and then you can see how far you can go without losing them.""
When Irish comedian Lee Brophy started posting parodies as a lip-syncing, LGBT-accepting Catholic priest who ""puts the bi in Bible"", he attracted more than 700,000 followers on TikTok - and reactions ranging from death threats to cries for help from queer teens in strict religious families.
Brophy's Edinburgh stand-up show, titled False Prophet, is about the double-edged impact of becoming known as the TikTok priest - and he will effectively kill off the character at the end of the festival.
""It's been a weird journey,"" says Brophy, who was also on the stand-up circuit before the pandemic. ""I wasn't prepared for any of this. I was just making silly jokes on the internet and trying to get a little bit of feedback from people. And I got a lot of feedback from people.""
His broad-minded, fun-loving priest was originally in a TV pilot that Brophy wrote at the start of lockdown. The comedian decided to test the script by posting clips on TikTok.
""The priest was a very minor character to begin with,"" he explains. ""Then I put him up online and he had this progressive point of view that people resonated with, and I was like, oh, there's an appetite for this.
""So I thought, I'll just do that. It became a scenario of me waking up every single morning, putting on what was to me a costume, and sitting in front of my phone by nine o'clock lip-synching to Taylor Swift.""
Some didn't get the joke, though. ""There are the people who believe I'm a priest and love it. And then there are the people who absolutely detest it, who are like, 'You are leading people to hell'.""
His task now, he says, is to ""not necessarily erase that part because I'm grateful for all the things that have come out of it - but to [show] I am not that person, give myself the freedom to be a performer again, and to be recognised as a performer and comedian and an artist"".
In a five-star review, Edinburgh Guide said it was ""so clear that this is just the stepping stone into something so much greater"".
So, after his Edinburgh run, he will post a video putting Father Lee out to pasture. ""I've been playing along with this because it's been funny to me, but I kind of want my life back now,"" he says.
Before the pandemic, sisters Chloe and Tabby Tingey had given up on being performers. Chloe, who trained at Berklee College of Music in Boston, was working in digital marketing. Tabby, who went to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, had retrained to teach yoga.
Covid hit, the yoga studio never opened, and the pair moved in together. They dipped their toes into TikTok with weightlifting challenges, strangely. Then, having both been recently dumped, they decided to post a comic song about relationships.
""We thought no-one would see it because nobody followed us at that point,"" says Tabby, 28. They were wrong, and tens of thousands did see it.
Chloe, 30, continues: ""We thought, oh, this is the most views we've ever had in our whole lives, so maybe we should just ride this wave. But it was a huge shock and surprise.""
r videos became more elaborate, and soon attracted millions of views. ""To this day, we're still shocked every day when we wake up that we're musical comedians,"" Chloe adds. ""This is very unexpected.""
As well as parodies about dating and men, they do hugely popular spoofs of a party-loving Boris Johnson. They usually rewrite the lyrics of pop hits, and now have 400,000 followers.
r live show Bittersweet, on the other hand, is all made up of their own frank and funny songs, which mostly take aim at manipulative, inadequate and infuriating men - ""every second-rate Romeo we've ever known"", as one tune puts it.
A couple of songs have appeared both online and on stage, but mostly there's not much crossover. Writing an hour-long stage show was ""very different than having these isolated little ideas"", Tabby says. 
Chloe explains: ""It's small little bits on TikTok, and for the live show we've had to really think about the arc of it, and how it all fits together.""
It is ""difficult to gauge"" how many people in the Edinburgh audience are there because of TikTok, Tabby says.
Her sister adds: ""Somebody came to our show who had come all the way from Illinois to see us because she's a TikTok fan of ours. That made us really feel an immense gratitude.""

business	Train drivers set to resume strikes in October	"rain drivers are set to stage more strikes in October as part of a long-running dispute over pay, the BBC understands.
Drivers at 12 train companies are expected to strike on 1 and 5 October.
Aslef, the train drivers' union, has not commented on the proposed industrial action out of respect ahead of Queen Elizabeth II's funeral.
A strike had been planned for 15 September, but was postponed following the announcement of the Queen's death. 
Aslef will not be making any public statements or comments on further strike action until Tuesday. 
But the managing director of rail operator LNER, David Horne, tweeted that the trade union Aslef had indeed notified it of strike action on Saturday 1 October and Wednesday 5 October.
Mr Horne said LNER had already suspended ticket sales for these dates and it would confirm as soon as possible which services will be running.
A rail industry source told the BBC that they found it ""incredible"" and ""utterly disrespectful"" that the Aslef leadership announced fresh strike action on Friday.
""This a time when the entire rail family is working hard to support the hundreds of thousands of people who wish to pay their respects to Her Majesty the Queen during this time of national mourning,"" they said.
A series of large-scale rail strikes has already happened in recent months, causing disruption for millions, with unions wanting pay increases in line with the rising cost of living.
Rail bosses say they want to give workers a pay rise. But they and the government insist changes are needed to ""modernise"" the railway, end some outdated working practices and save money.

London Marathon is also taking place on 2 October.
During her campaign, Prime Minister Liz Truss pledged to introduce new restrictions on trade unions, which drew severe criticism from the likes of the Trade Unions' Congress as an ""attack on fundamental British liberty"".
One of her proposals included ensuring that a minimum level of service is provided in some sectors, including the railways.
Unions currently have to give two weeks' notice of planned strike action. "	/news/business-62923999

EasyJet said it had cut 80 flights on Sunday, and apologised to customers for the disruption.
ransport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC the aviation industry cut too many jobs during the coronavirus pandemic and it must not oversell flights.
He said he wanted airlines to automatically compensate passengers.
Passengers have faced a raft of UK flight cancellations causing disruptions for many families on half-term holidays.
-year-old Noah and his younger sister Beau won't be in school on Monday morning after a cancelled EasyJet flight left their family stranded in Dalyan, Turkey.
r mother, Emma, a hairdresser has had to cancel clients by text. 
family of six, including Emma's parents, spent 10 hours on Saturday night at the airport waiting to see if they would be able to fly out as planned, before finally being bussed back to the hotel at 4.30am.
EasyJet offered them a flight on Thursday to Liverpool, but their car is parked at Gatwick.
""The [EasyJet] app literally says rearrange your flight or get a refund,"" says father Scott. ""So we've just spend £3,000 on a flight home tomorrow night... flying to Stanstead."" 
EasyJet said it had cancelled about 80 flights on Sunday ""due to the ongoing challenging operating environment"".
""We are very sorry and fully understand the disruption this will have caused for our customers,"" the airline said, adding it was doing everything possible to get passengers to their destinations.
It said it had extended its customer service opening hours from 07:00 to 23:00, and was helping those affected find hotel accommodation.
Mr Shapps told BBC One's Sunday Morning programme that labour shortages were behind the travel disruption, resulting in airlines ""finding it difficult to get people on board"".
""When someone has bought a ticket for a flight, they've every right to expect that flight will take off, and not find that flight has been cancelled,"" he said. 
""Airlines should be cautious about not overselling those flights, [and] where there are problems they need to fix them quickly."" 
He said the government had provided £8bn of support to the sector during the pandemic, along with furlough support, so decisions to cut staff had been made by the industry.
Mr Shapps added that airlines had ""cut too deep"" during the coronavirus pandemic.
""Clearly [the airlines] have been taken by surprise by the way in which people have returned to travel after two years of being locked down,"" he said.
He added that he wanted a ""proper charter"" for passengers so they could get ""quick and straightforward compensation or be put on other flights"".
Mr Shapps said he wanted a similar system to ""Delay Repay"" train passenger refunds ""where it's an automated process"".
However, he again rejected the idea of easing aviation labour shortages by relaxing immigration requirements.
Airlines have called on the government to issue special immigration visas to allow them to recruit overseas workers in the short term, as was done for the haulage and meat processing industries.
was backed by London's Labour mayor Sadiq Khan who said airport jobs should be opened up to people from the European Union.
""This is self-inflicted from the government. This is about Brexit plus Covid.""
""What we don't want is this spring misery turned into summer misery,"" he said. 
However, Mr Shapps said after the government eased immigration rules in the haulage industry only 27 lorry drivers had come over from the European Union to help ease the chronic shortage, which instead had been alleviated by government measures.
Gatwick Airport said that 52 departures and 30 arrivals were cancelled on Sunday.
majority were EasyJet flights, but British Airways, Wizz Air and Vueling were also affected.
Flights from Barcelona, Nice, Madrid, Belfast, Geneva, Corfu, Faro in Portugal and Glasgow were among those cancelled.
A Gatwick spokesperson said the airport was ""operating normally"" but would be busy with 830 flights.
ravel expert Simon Calder said that on a typical day you would expect to see half a dozen flights being cancelled to and from the UK, with those spread over all airlines.
He said in addition about 3,000 passengers heading for Luton on Sunday had been diverted after a power failure affected air traffic control systems.
British Airways declined to comment.
Wizz Air issued a statement saying it was doing as much as it could to help passengers reach their destinations. It said several things were causing ""operational instability"" in the travel industry, including staff shortages within air traffic control, ground operations and baggage handling, security and across airports.
It offered customers affected its ""sincere apologies"" and said they would be offered alternative flights with Wizz Air, a full refund or 120% in airline credit, which it aimed to process within one week.

sports	All-Ireland Club Camogie final: Loughgiel beaten by holders Sarsfields at Croke Park	"Loughgiel's first appearance in an All-Ireland Club Camogie final ended in a 2-14 to 1-14 defeat by holders Sarsfields at Croke Park.
Siobhan McGrath's early goal helped Galway side Sarsfields into an five-point lead but Loughgiel hit back.
Caitrin Dobbin netted and the teams were level at the break before Sarsfield burst clear with Rachel Murray firing in their second goal.
Loughgiel rallied again to equalise but Sarsfields finished strongly to win.
Earlier on Saturday at Croke Park, Down club Clonduff claimed the All-Ireland Intermediate title with a 0-12 to 1-6 victory over Kilkenny side James Stephens. 
Paula O'Hagan and Sara Louise Graffin combined for nine of Clonduff's scores as the Shamrocks secured the trophy for the second time, four years after the first.
It was a see-saw decider at headquarters with the outstanding Roisin McCormick firing over eight points for Loughgiel while the McGrath sisters - Siobhan and Niamh - were instrumental in Sarsfields securing their third All-Ireland crown.
Sarsfields made a blistering start with Siobhan McGrath shooting low into the net in the first minute and she added a point after team-mate Caoimhe Kelly slotted between the posts.
Mary McKillen put Loughgiel on the scoreboard and Niamh McGarth restored the five-point margin before the Ulster champions produced a run of 1-4 without reply, starting with points from Lucia McNaughton and McCormick.
Dobbin ran through before rifling into the bottom corner on 28 minutes and an Annie Lynn double left Loughgiel two points in front.
Kelly pulled one back and Klara Donohue registered the last point of the half to make it 1-6 to 1-6 at the break. 
McCormick edged Loughgiel back into the lead on the restart before Sarsfields seized control again with a 1-3 burst.
Siobhan McGarth and Shannon Corcoran flighted over before Murray blasted into the net, with the goal followed by a Niamh McGrath point.
Loughgiel showed spirit by wiping out another five-point deficit - four of the scores came from McCormick while Dobbin also pointed.
Siobhan McGrath and McCormick exchanged points before Sarsfields produced the decisive thrust with four straight points.
Player-of the-match Niamh McGrath bagged two with Siobhan McGrath and Sarah Spellman also slotting over.
McCormick made it eight points from eight frees to give Loughgiel a glimmer of hope but Sarsfields saw out the final minutes to earn a three-point success."	/sport/gaelic-games/64013031
sports	Netball World Cup 2019: What's next for England?	"Record crowds watched Tracey Neville's England win their third successive World Cup bronze medal in Liverpool - but it was not the climax the Roses hoped for.
r third place play-off win came one year and three months after they shocked Australia - the most successful netball nation in the world - to win Commonwealth gold. 
As they leave Liverpool without the world title and with Neville leaving her role as head coach, what's next for this Roses team? 
Neville, 42, announced before the World Cup that she would be standing down to start a family.
former international, the sister of former footballers Phil and Gary Neville, was appointed in 2015, having coached domestic side Manchester Thunder for the previous four years.
She was tasked with turning around the fortunes of an England side who had finished fourth at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
She won two World Cup bronzes during her tenure, while also engineering Quad Series victories over Australia and New Zealand, but will forever be remembered as the coach that guided the team to a first major championship gold. 
So how do you fill those shoes?
England Netball chief executive Joanna Adams says she wants the next national coach to be British. It is understood four-time Superleague-winning coach and ex-England wing attack Tamsin Greenway is one of the front-runners for the job, although Adelaide Thunderbirds' Australian boss Tania Obst is also a leading contender.
""I think it's fine to get someone foreign in if they are the best person for the job but I can't think of anyone that would be better than what we've got here in England,"" said former Roses captain Sara Bayman, a BBC pundit.
""There is going to be such a big rebuilding process, so it's not necessarily about who comes in, but what they can offer.
""Tracey was a personality and did a lot for the image of the sport, but now it is very much about bringing in someone who is a developmental coach. It's a real grey area on what the job is.""
Momentum is key to growing a sport's popularity but there is a bit of a gap in netball's scheduling after the World Cup. The English domestic season does not start until January and the next major international event does not come until 2022 - at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games. 
""We have been building up the sport and we have a really strong Superleague and a quad series that keeps netball on the TV and at the forefront of people's minds,"" said England Netball chief executive Adams.
""We have surpassed Sydney [the 2015 World Cup hosts] in ticket sales and we want mums and daughters to love the sport and I think we have done that.""
m lining up to compete in Birmingham will look considerably different to the one who stepped on the podium on Sunday.
Four Commonwealth champions - defenders Geva Mentor, Eboni Usoro-Brown, centre-courter Jade Clarke and shooter Jo Harten - are all in their 30s, and are unlikely to make another major tournament. 
""Some of those players have been around this team for a long time and it's about whether they want to keep going,"" added Adams. 
""It's a tough sport but there is some great talent coming through. We didn't want the legacy of netball not to continue.""
England not winning gold on home soil could be seen as failure, but given the Roses' defeat by eventual champions New Zealand was their eighth semi-final loss in a row, was it a surprise?
Australian and Kiwis have contested every World Cup final since 1991, with the Diamonds winning 11 titles. 
But their dominance is under threat, according to England mid-courter Sasha Corbin.
""Australia have always been on the top,"" she said. ""No-one's ever seemed to take them on, especially for the past few World Cups. You can see how close netball is at the top level now.""

Four African nations finished in the top eight at the World Cup for the first time this year, and South Africa breaking into the top four shows nations are catching up.
So will it just be Australia challenging for New Zealand's World Cup crown in Cape Town in 2023?
""Everyone's getting closer,"" added Bayman. ""England's Commonwealth Games victory on the Gold Coast last year made other nations believe that they could do it. 
""We've seen South Africa in the top four for the first time in 24 years, we see a new world champion for the first time in 16 years. Things are changing in global netball and it's exciting to see.""

politics	Brexit: French tourism slump after leaving EU, Brittany Ferries says	"umber of people arriving at a UK port from France has more than halved after Brexit, a ferry firm has said.
Portsmouth ferry port saw 338,000 arrivals in 2019 but only 155,000 in 2022, according to Brittany Ferries.
firm said ""Brexit-related friction"" including a need for passports was a major factor, although sailings to and from Ireland, within the European Union, had seen increased business.
Home Office said the UK's entry rules were relatively generous.
Brittany Ferries said the vast majority of lost visitors were French holidaymakers, including student groups.
Spokesman Nigel Wonnacott said: ""We used to have loads of coaches parking outside with happy schoolchildren enjoying Portsmouth, going up to London and we really don't see much of that any more.
""Post-Brexit, French travellers are required to travel [to the UK] with a passport so it's expensive for them to get a passport because it's about 90 euros (£78), and it's also a big administrative burden.
""For Portsmouth, for the surroundings, for UK plc it's the loss of a significant number of potential travellers and all the richness that they bring economically and culturally.""
Previously the Tourism Alliance, which represents the British tourism industry, estimated a £875m loss to the UK economy from lost student groups in 2022.
Brittany Ferries said many French visitors had switched to its sailings to Ireland.
Last year saw a 30% increase in passengers travelling on its routes between Ireland, and both France and Spain, compared to 2019, the firm said.
Brittany Ferries operates services from France to Rosslare in Ireland and to Plymouth, Poole and Portsmouth in England.
A Home Office spokesman said the UK's rules were ""among the most generous in the world"".
kesman said visitors from France and other affected countries were told almost a year in advance of the requirement to use a passport from October 2021.

business	Jaguar Land Rover cuts output at UK factories due to chip shortage	"Carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is reducing output at its factories in Solihull and Halewood until the spring, due to ongoing problems obtaining enough computer chips for new vehicles.
xpected to affect the output of models such as the Jaguar F-Pace and Land Rover Discovery Sport.
move is understood to be temporary, as first reported in the Guardian.
In the meantime, JLR will focus on more profitable models such as the Range Rover.
Output of these cars has been ramped up in recent months. 
JLR's factory in Nitra, Slovakia, is not affected. 
Modern cars are heavily reliant on computer chips to control a variety of onboard systems, ranging from anti-lock braking and emissions controls to satellite navigation and in-car entertainment.
But supplies from East Asia have been heavily disrupted in the wake of the Covid pandemic, while carmakers have faced intense competition for available supplies from other industries.
In a statement, JLR said it would ""continue to actively manage the operational patterns of our manufacturing plants whilst the industry experiences ongoing global semi-conductor supply chain disruption"".
""We expect our performance to continue improving in the second half of the year, as new agreements with semiconductor partners take effect, enabling us to build and deliver more vehicles to our clients,"" it added.
UK car production still remains well below levels seen before the pandemic, despite an increase in October, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show.    
ustry built 69,524 cars in October, up 7.4% from a year earlier, but the SMMT said manufacturers were still suffering from ""turbulent"" supplies of components.
""There's been real shortages in the supply chain, most obviously in semiconductors, which is leading to really erratic levels of production,"" the SMMT's chief executive Mike Hawes told the BBC's Today programme.
""[Production] was up in October, but we expect it to be volatile as we go forward especially when some parts come from China.""
Mr Hawes said the UK was ""no way close"" to making enough chips for the car industry.
""Massive investments are required and some governments in the world are putting up billions upon billions of pounds to attract investment and build new fabs (semiconductor fabrication plants).
""We should be building about a million cars a year, so when you have about 1,500 chips per car you can see just how incredible the volumes of these chips you need just to support the automotive industry, let alone things like personal electronics."" "	/news/business-63756079
technology	Coding: Female engineers deleting myth that tech is for men	"Growing up, Zoe Thomas never thought she could work in computing
""I foolishly thought coding was for men good at maths."" 
Zoe Thomas, 29, from Caerphilly, felt she needed a new challenge but never thought she could work with computers.
But after taking evening classes in coding she switched careers from customer service to software engineering for an insurance firm.
Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that women make up 31% of staff in the wider technology industry.
But for software developers, web design professionals and data analysts, the proportion is far lower at just 18%.
""I never thought I could do it, but it's honestly the best decision I've ever made,"" said Zoe.
""Because I studied media, psychology and English at A-level I just didn't think I'd end up here,"" explained Zoe, who works for Veygo Insurance in Cardiff.
""I now help make the website function, adding features and sorting any problems that arise, and I really love it.""
Companies across the UK want more women like Zoe to work in the technology sector. 
More than 7,500 people work for insurance firm Admiral, which is based in Cardiff, but most of its technology staff are men. 
Admiral's director of IT, Christine Theodore, said the sector was so fast growing it was vital more women enter the industry.
""These continue to be the skills of the future,"" she said. ""People shouldn't shy away from it, these skills can be taught. 
""I've been in IT for most of my professional life and I feel really passionate that women can definitely be in leadership positions.""
Admiral has been working with several companies to appeal to more women, including the social enterprise Code First Girls.
It works with more than 100 businesses across the UK to teach women to code, including Zoe. 
Code First Girls CEO Anna Brailsford said there was a danger ""labelling"" girls in school could have a detrimental effect on their confidence. 
Coding is a set of instructions used to tell devices such as computers, mobile phones and even traffic lights and aeroplanes what to do.
People who work in coding say it's like learning a language that tells the computer what you want it to do. 
Coders, or programmers, are people who write the programs behind everything we see and do on a computer.
Girls outperform boys in IT at both A-level and GCSE, a Welsh government-commissioned report found, but far fewer girls choose to study the subject. 
Aisha Arshad, 32, from Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan, has always worked in IT and studied it at A-level at school. 
She now works in coding for Admiral, collating information so performance can be analysed. 
""When I tell people about my job I often hear 'oh, it's a very male-dominated career',"" she said. 
""But I love it. It's not the same boring thing day in day out,"" she explained. ""I'm doing one thing one day, and then completely different problem-solving the next day."""	/news/uk-wales-63839738
entertainment	Peter Kay announces return to stand-up during I'm A Celebrity	"Comedian Peter Kay has announced his return to stand-up with his first live tour in 12 years.
49-year-old has been largely absent from the spotlight since he cancelled his 2017 tour due to ""unforeseen family circumstances"".
Announcing his new live dates, Kay said: ""It's good to get back to what I love doing best, stand-up comedy.""
His comeback was announced during an ad break in the series launch of ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!
DJ Chris Moyles, rugby player Mike Tindall and singer Boy George were all seen entering the jungle in Sunday's opening episode, but the former health secretary Matt Hancock will not appear until later in the series. 
During the commercial break, Kay was seen carrying a rolled-up carpet into a house while confirming to nearby fans he will return to stand-up comedy next month.
median will embark on a new UK arena tour, spanning from December to August 2023.
What is it like seeing Peter Kay live 38 times?
By Daniel Rosney, BBC News Entertainment reporter
Back in 2010 I worked as a yellow blazer-wearing steward (""no filming of the stage, please"") at the Manchester Arena - something Peter Kay himself had previously done - and it was there that The Tour That Doesn't Tour Tour was on for 20 nights.
It later did go on tour, and returned for a further 20 shows.
Fans would cry tears of laughter at his opening gambit about those in their seats being his employer for the night, along with his impressions of people using an ""I'm ill"" voice to call their boss and bunk off work for the day. 
He'd reference his old jokes as well: ""Every time I go to an Italian restaurant, they give me free garlic bread… it's why my new catch-phrase is plas-ma… plas-ma…."" (because he wanted a free TV set).
While the routine was largely the same every show, I still laughed out loud each time, along with those seeing it for the first time. His observational comedy was something everyone could relate to.
""Have we got any teachers in?"" he'd ask. There'd be a cheer. ""Woah, woah, woah, no shouting out, put your hands up, one rule for one…""
But it was his encore which proved he's a true showman. He'd impersonate Freddie Mercury, using a shovel as a make-shift guitar, belting out the hits he and audiences loved. 
After a near two-hour comedy gig he became a rock star and people would be on their feet wanting more and they're finally getting it. 
I didn't get to keep my yellow blazer when I traded it in for a BBC lanyard, but given Peter Kay sometimes wore one to show his fans to their seats, he might get one dry-cleaned, just in case.
will mark Kay's first live tour since 2010, when he scored the Guinness World Record for the biggest selling stand-up tour of all time, playing to more than 1.2 million people.
rt concluded with the fans asking Kay whether he had finally bought his mother a bungalow - a reference the comic's previous Mum Wants A Bungalow tour. Kay replied that he had, explaining that his mother now wanted a new carpet to go in it.
In a statement, the Bolton-born comic said: ""It's good to get back to what I love doing best, stand-up comedy, and if there's ever a time people need a laugh it's now.
""And with the cost of living at an all-time high, ticket prices are starting from £35 - the same price they were on my previous tour in 2010.""
Kay will begin his tour on 2 December at the Manchester AO Arena before visiting locations including Birmingham, Liverpool, Sheffield, Belfast, Newcastle, Glasgow and Dublin.
His run will end on 11 August at the Sheffield Utilita Arena. London was absent from the tour locations listed in the advert.
A poster for the event featured Kay holding a sign reading, ""Better late than never"" and described a ticket to his shows as an ""ideal Christmas gift"".
Kay has kept a low profile in recent years. He notably returned to the stage in August 2021 for two special charity events to raise money for Laura Nuttall, a then 20-year-old with an aggressive type of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme.
re was also a brief return in January 2021 when he appeared on BBC Radio 2 for a conversation with Cat Deeley - who was filling in after Graham Norton left the station - about his love of music, mixtapes and the musical Mamma Mia.
He also made a surprise appearance at a charity screening of his series Car Share in 2018."	/news/entertainment-arts-63537991
health	December strike by NHS nurses is biggest in their history	"Nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are to strike for two days next month in what is set to be their biggest walkout in the NHS's history.
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) announced strikes on 15 and 20 December in its pay dispute with the government.
Nurses will still provide emergency care, but routine services will be hit.
RCN said it had been given no choice after ministers would not reopen talks, but the government said the 19% pay rise demanded was unaffordable.
RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: ""Ministers have chosen strike action.
""Nursing staff have had enough of being taken for granted, enough of low pay and unsafe staffing levels, enough of not being able to give our patients the care they deserve.""
Under trade union laws, the RCN has to ensure life-preserving care is provided during the strikes, which will last from 08:00 to 20:00 GMT.
Watch this video quiz to test your knowledge of nurses' pay
kely to mean some urgent cancer services, urgent tests and scans and ongoing care for vulnerable patients will be protected alongside A&E and intensive care - although it will be up to local health bosses and union leaders to negotiate exact staffing levels on strike days.
Share your experiences. Get in touch.
But it seems almost certain the walkout will increase the backlog in non-urgent hospital treatment - a record seven million people are already on the waiting list in England.
Louise Ansari, from the Healthwatch England patient watchdog, said she was ""concerned"" about the impact on this group of patients.
Hospital nurse Shaun Williams only started working as a nurse a year ago.
He said the thought of striking makes him sad, but he is prepared to do it.
""I am sorry we are having to do this. 
""But we are doing it for the right reasons, we are doing it for patient safety.
""You are running on reserves most days. We do not have enough staff and because of the lack of nurses, patients are at risk.
""Unless we pay nurses more we are not going to attract people or keep people.""
And he says unless the situation changes he may even quit nursing.
GP services, however, will be unaffected as nurses working in practices were not entitled to take part in the ballot.
And because a series of individual ballots were held at NHS trusts and boards rather than one national ballot, nurses at more than 40% of England's hospitals, mental health and community services are not entitled to strike because the turnout was too low in those votes.
However, walkouts can happen at all of Northern Ireland's health boards and in all-but-one in Wales, the Aneurin Bevan.
What is not clear yet is just how many of the services where strike action can take place will see walkouts. 
It is possible the RCN could stagger the action so some services go on strike in December, with others to follow suit next year if the industrial action continues.
It is seen by the union as a way of limiting the disruption to patients, while keeping the pressure on the government.
Individual NHS trusts and boards will not find out until next week whether they will see walkouts on the two dates, because that is when the formal notices will go out.
RCN has called for a rise of 5% above the RPI inflation rate, which currently stands at above 14%, but no UK nation has offered close to that.
In England and Wales, NHS staff, including nurses, have been given a rise of at least £1,400 - worth about 4% on average for nurses.
In Northern Ireland, nurses are yet to receive a pay award because there is no working government.
Strike action has been suspended in Scotland however after the government there made a fresh offer worth more than 8% for a newly-qualified nurse. More senior nurses are being offered less. The RCN said it was considering the offer.
During the ballot, the results of which were announced two weeks ago, the RCN had argued this year's below-inflation pay award came after years of squeezes on nurse's salaries. 
But England Health Secretary Steve Barclay said the RCN's demands were not affordable, adding he ""deeply regretted"" union members would be taking action.
He pointed out the government had met the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in giving its award.
And it followed a 3% pay rise last year, in recognition of work during the pandemic, despite a public-sector pay freeze.
""Our priority is keeping patients safe. The NHS has tried and tested plans in place to minimise disruption,"" he added.
Welsh government said it was unable to enter pay talks without extra funding from the UK government.
Labour shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said talks should restart - although he would not commit to paying the above-inflation pay rise the RCN was seeking.
""Why on earth is the health secretary refusing to negotiate with nurses? Patients will never forgive the Conservatives for this negligence.""
will only be the second time RCN members have been on strike.
In 2019, nurses in Northern Ireland walked out over pay, while nurses who are members of Unison in England walked out in 2014 over pay.
A host of other major health unions, including Unison, the Royal College of Midwives, GMB and Unite, have all started balloting members."	/news/health-63746334
politics	The Supreme Court judgement is clear but not what Nicola Sturgeon wanted	"Clarity was what Nicola Sturgeon asked for and clarity is what she now has from the UK Supreme Court. 
judges have made clear that the law does not allow Holyrood to legislate for an independence referendum without Westminster's agreement. 
means there will not be an indyref2 on 19 October 2023, as the Scottish government had planned. 
SNP ministers will accept the judgement and respect the law. A wildcat ballot in the Catalan-style is not an option. 
A legal referendum can only happen if the first minister somehow persuades the prime minister to abandon his opposition. 
re's little prospect of that happening in the short term, so the renewed campaign for independence just became a longer haul. 
It will immediately incorporate this court defeat into its narrative and seek to use it to build support. 
At rallies across Scotland, independence supporters will protest that Scottish democracy is being denied. 
Some will argue the nature of the Anglo-Scottish union has changed from one based on consent to one based on law. 
Others will ask: if a Holyrood majority for indyref2 is not accepted as a mandate by Westminster then what is the democratic route to independence? 
reply from supporters of the union will be that the democracy of the 2014 referendum should be allowed to stand for at least a generation. 
will argue that tackling the cost of living crisis should be taking up all the available bandwidth in politics right now. 
UK PM Rishi Sunak may want to demonstrate his commitment to devolution through an early visit to Scotland and perhaps a joint announcement with the Scottish government on freeports. 
UK Labour leader Keir Starmer is likely to adopt plans for a UK-wide redistribution of power along the lines proposed by the former prime minister Gordon Brown, who is due to publish a blueprint soon. 
g question is what will Nicola Sturgeon do next?
Plan A - that Westminster would accept a Holyrood majority for indyref2 as a mandate has failed. 
Plan B - that the courts might allow a referendum without Westminster consent has failed. 
r stated Plan C - to take the independence argument into the next UK general election and treat it like a referendum. 
Ms Sturgeon has previously said she would seek to win more than 50% of the vote in the election and if successful would claim that as a mandate for independence. 
She recommitted to that plan in the aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling but left some of the details to a special SNP conference to be held in the New Year. 
It would be a huge gamble. 
In its best ever election result in 2015, the SNP fell just short of 50%. 
xtremely high bar in an election where any number of other issues could be at play. 
Clearing it is unlikely to get easier if Labour continue to be seen as serious challengers to the Conservatives in the battle for Number 10 and an alternative route to political change. 
re is also no guarantee that record-breaking electoral success for the SNP (and its allies) would be accepted by whomever forms the next UK government as a basis for independence negotiations. 
Even some on Nicola Sturgeon's side privately hope she will back off this all-or-nothing approach. 
Because if this Plan C fails, it would be time for a new independence strategy and presumably new leadership of the SNP. 
Nicola Sturgeon refuses to be drawn on what would happen in these circumstances, except to say: ""if we can't win, we don't deserve to be independent""."	/news/uk-scotland-63729280

business	US jobs growth solid but slowing amid inflation fight	"Jobs growth in the US is continuing at a solid, though slowing pace, despite rising prices and higher borrowing costs weighing on the economy. 
Employers added 261,000 jobs in October, while the unemployment rate rose slightly to 3.7%, the US Labor Department said on Friday.
ws comes as the economy remains a top concern for voters ahead of next week's midterm elections.
Despite a strong labour market, soaring costs have hit public confidence.
Consumer prices are rising at a pace not seen since the early 1980s. Inflation, which measures how the cost of living changes over time, is up 8.2% over the 12 months to September. 
While the rate has slowed since June as motor fuel prices fall, the cost of groceries, medical bills and many other items continues to climb.
ue has weighed on Democrats, who were already fighting an uphill battle to maintain their slim hold of Congress. 
""People are depressed and often people vote with their pocketbooks,"" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief US economist at S&P Global Ratings. ""Inflation is almost everywhere. People are squeezed at the checkout stand, they're squeezed with their rental payments, when they try to buy a home.""
White House has made the case that some slowdown is expected - and healthy - as the economy returns to normal after the surge in activity when it reopened from lockdowns.
And for now, government figures suggest there has only been mild softening in the labour market.
Although the unemployment rate ticked up from 3.5% in September, the 261,000 jobs added last month was far better than economists had expected, with healthcare and manufacturing firms helping to drive the hiring. 
Wage gains were also strong, despite not keeping pace with inflation, with average hourly pay up 4.7% over the past year.
""We're going to do what it takes to bring inflation down,"" President Joe Biden said Friday, responding to the latest figures. ""But as long as I'm president, I'm not going to accept an argument that the problem is that too many Americans are finding good jobs. ""
With prices still rising sharply, however, analysts say they expect to see job losses increase next year, as consumers start to curb their spending and the central bank raises interest rates to rein in rising costs.
Since March, when interest rates were hovering near zero, the Federal Reserve has hiked borrowing costs six times, moves that have rippled out to the public in the form of sharply higher rates for home, car and business loans. 
By making borrowing more expensive, the bank hopes to cool demand among businesses and households, in turn easing the pressures pushing up prices.
""The US economy continues to create far more jobs than population growth can accommodate, putting more upward pressure on wages and prices,"" said Ron Temple, head of US Equities at Lazard Asset Management.
""The Fed has attacked the inflation challenge aggressively, but will be forced to remain on the offensive as long as the labour markets remain resilient.""
Some sectors, such as housing and technology, have been hit hard already and anecdotal reports of job cuts and hiring freezes have increased, as firms prepare for a downturn.
On Thursday, payments firm Stripe on Thursday said it was axing 14% of its workforce, while Lyft, a taxi firm that is Uber's main rival, said it was cutting 700 jobs. 
Elon Musk told Twitter staff the company would impose widespread job cuts, and Amazon also said it would halt hiring for corporate positions across the company. 
""We think that 2022 represents the beginning of a different economic climate,"" Stripe executives wrote in an email to staff. ""Our business is fundamentally well-positioned to weather harsh circumstances... however, we do need to match the pace of our investments with the realities around us.""
But the ongoing strength of the labour market has raised hopes that the US may be able to avoid a severe recession.
Dane Brecher helps to run Plastic Crafts, a 40-person family-owned manufacturing company in New York that his grandfather started in 1934. 
usiness has felt the effects of higher interest rates, opting to pay cash when it recently bought new machinery, instead of borrowing as it might have a few months ago.
But it does not have major debts and sales have been steady. While there may be some signs of slowdown, he said he is not worried about a serious downturn.
""If interest rates were a little less, I'm sure we'd be looking to expand more,"" he said. ""We're just going to stay the course... we're in a good place. Unfortunately, I don't know if the rest of the country is, but we're OK."""	/news/business-63507546

politics	What's happening in Parliament this week?	"'Twas the week before Christmas and all through the Houses of Parliament, barely a legislator was stirring... with a low-key agenda where the gentle slide towards the holiday will be broken only by a couple of big committee hearings, or possibly by ""events, dear boy"". 
Commons breaks up on Tuesday, so there will be no Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, but Rishi Sunak will still face questioning from the Liaison Committee of senior MPs. 
Connoisseurs will recall their last close encounter with a PM, back in July - that surreal session with Boris Johnson solemnly discussing his policies as his government disintegrated around him. Liz Truss didn't last long enough to get a gig at the Liaison Committee, and this will be Rishi Sunak's debut before it. 
Commons: (14:30) Home Office Questions start the week, after which Labour's Andrew Western will take his seat having won the Stretford and Urmston by-election.
main debate will be the second reading of the Seafarers' Wages Bill - a measure to ensure that seafarers working out of UK ports are paid the national minimum wage while in UK waters. The bill is part of the government's response to the outrage caused when P&O Ferries sacked 800 staff without notice earlier this year. It has already cleared the Lords. 
will probably leave plenty of time for a government statement or some other significant item to be dropped in at short notice. 
journment debate sees Labour MP Sam Tarry, recently deselected by his local party, discussing pay and conditions for NHS nurses.
Westminster Hall: (16:30) MPs debate e-petition 604509, 'Create a National Sleep Strategy', which notes that since 2018 schools have referred 1,400 children without beds to a bed poverty charity, and says this should be seen as a key public health issue affecting educational outcomes for children across the UK. The petition attracted 18,496 signatures. 
Committees: Public Accounts (16:00) looks at the work of the Passport Office, including this summer's passport debacle when it was overwhelmed by post-Covid demand and thousands of people missed holidays and important travel for sickness and funerals. Top Home Office officials including Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft will give evidence. 
Lords: (14:30) The main event is the first of five days of committee scrutiny of the National Security Bill. This is the probing, shadow boxing phase of detailed debate, where amendments are not pushed to a vote, but the arguments tee up amendments at report stage in the new year. There's already a lot of chatter about several aspects of the legislation, including a proposed register of ""foreign influence"". 
One influential voice already asking questions is Lord Anderson of Ipswich, a former reviewer of anti-terror legislation. He's already tweeted that the register is ""an ill-directed and vastly overboard control on foreign lobbying, not a national security measure"". Ministers will have a chance to answer those concerns.
re's also a short debate on plans to improve trade and investment relations with countries in Central America.
Commons: (11:30) Treasury Questions start the day. 
re will then be a ten minute rule bill; Conservative Darren Henry wants to boost shared parental leave. 
main debate will be the traditional end-of-term one where any MP can raise a subject of their choice. 
Westminster Hall: MPs debate family businesses (09:30); the future of rail services (11:00); the expansion of the London's ultra-low emission zone (14:30); the Energy Charter Treaty (16:00); and affordable childcare (16:30).
Committees: The big event is the appearance of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak before the Liaison Committee, the super-committee of select committee chairs, presided over by Sir Bernard Jenkin. The session has been divided into four segments, starting with global issues, including the war in Ukraine, migration, and the COP27 climate summit, with questioning conducted by Clive Betts of the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Committee, Philip Dunne (Environmental Audit), Dame Diana Johnson (Home Affairs), and Alicia Kearns (Foreign Affairs). 
xt section is on the UK's place in the world and the state of the Union, featuring Sir Bill Cash (European Scrutiny), Joanna Cherry (Human Rights), Robin Walker (Education), and Pete Wishart (Scottish Affairs). 
Next will be economic issues, including the Autumn Statement and the cost of living, with Harriett Baldwin (Treasury), Steve Brine (Health and Social Care), Sir Robert Neill (Justice), and Sir Stephen Timms (Work and Pensions). Finally there's a cross-issue segment featuring Catherine McKinnell (Petitions). 
Earlier (10:00), Health and Social Care has a session on ambulance delays and strikes, with evidence from emergency health chiefs and the GMB union talking about waiting times and preparations for ambulance strikes, and what is being done to provide a safe level of emergency cover for the public during strike action after Health Minister Will Quince told MPs it was ""likely"" the most serious and life-threatening calls, categories 1 and 2, would be responded to. New chair Steve Brine promised more topical hearings - and this is the kind of rapid response hearing he had in mind. 
Lords: (14:30) The main event is the Finance Bill - this being a money bill, and therefore untouchable in the Lords, peers will take the second reading and remaining stages of debate in a single gulp. There might be some grumbles, but they're not allowed to make any changes.
Commons will have departed, but the Lords (11:00) beaver on with day 2 of committee on the National Security Bill. 
re's also a short debate led by crossbencher Lord Bird on the government's estimates of the savings that might be realised by their cost-cutting initiative. 
Committees: Justice and Home Affairs (10:00) hears from Home Secretary Suella Braverman.

sports	NBA: Giannis Antetokounmpo leads Bucks to win over Warriors	"Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 30 points as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Golden State Warriors 128-111 in a testy match between the NBA's last two champions.
Warriors beat the league-leading Boston Celtics on Tuesday but this was their 12th loss in 14 away games.
Coach Steve Kerr earned a technical foul for his furious reaction after Stephen Curry appeared to be caught on the head as he made a three-point shot.
""I felt like we were on the bad end of things to start the game,"" he said.
""That needs to be called.""
Warriors were 14 points down early in the second quarter but briefly threatened to reel in the Bucks - who they succeeded as NBA champions in June - as they closed to within six.
But the hosts proved too strong and Kerr pulled his starters out of the game in the final stages in order to prepare for their trip to the Indianapolis Pacers on Wednesday. 
Elsewhere the Celtics got back on track with a 122-118 overtime win at long-time rivals the Los Angeles Lakers. 
Jayson Tatum scored 44 points for the visitors, who improved their NBA-leading record to 22 wins and seven defeats this season.
Anthony Davis scored 37 points with 12 rebounds and LeBron James added 33 points with nine rebounds and nine assists but the Lakers lost for the fourth time in their last five games.
Lakers, who are 12th in the Western Conference, were subjected to stinging criticism from NBA great Charles Barkley.
""The Lakers stink,"" he told TNT. ""We have to talk about the Lakers, but the Lakers are awful.
""We don't talk about no other 12th seeds. In the East, we don't talk about the Washington Wizards do we?"""	/sport/basketball/63968476
entertainment	Strictly Come Dancing: Hamza's Wellingborough School 'very proud'	"2022 Strictly Come Dancing winner's former school has said he has been a ""huge inspiration"" to its pupils.
BBC wildlife presenter, Hamza Yassin, 32, who attended the private Wellingborough School in Northamptonshire 2004-2008, lifted the glitterball trophy on Saturday.
Head teacher Andrew Holman said he was a ""legend"" and said the school was ""very proud"". 
Yassin previously said he ""would be nowhere"" without the school.
's website said Yassin originally pursued a medical degree after leaving before switching to zoology, followed by reading for a master's degree in biological photography and imaging.
As one of Britain's up and coming wildlife photographers, he made appearances on BBC's The One Show and programmes such as Animal Park, Countryfile and Springwatch before being invited to front his own show on the CBeebies channel, Let's Go For A Walk, in which Ranger Hamza takes children on rambles.
Now living in a remote part of the west Scottish mainland, in December 2019, he went to Antarctica to film for a new season of Sir David Attenborough's The Frozen Planet.
Yassin, who had never had any dance lessons before taking part in the BBC's 14-week entertainment programme, beat Molly Rainford, Fleur East and Helen Skelton in the final, with viewers enjoying the non-dancer's progress.
Mr Holman, who joined the school in 2018, said he had spoken to a few staff who had known him and said ""what you saw on the TV is what he was like"".
""He was very down to earth, very rounded and wore his heart on his sleeve,"" he said.
""He was very new to the area as his family had only recently moved from Sudan, but he settled in quickly and was willing to give things a go and get stuck in, which is what he has done on Strictly and we are very proud.""
He said the former pupil had shown what they try to instil in their pupils every day.
""We always say think big, think what you can achieve and give it a go, you never know what will happen, and that's what we've seen in the past three months,"" he said.
""It's about having a can-do attitude.""
Hamza had been a ""huge inspiration"" to the school and that everyone was very excited knowing that he had once walked its corridors and classrooms.
""There are so many inspirational people, but as a pupil here, seeing someone who has come from where they are and have a job that they love and other strings to their bow, it's just wonderful,"" he said.
""You can't ask for a better role model.
""They say 'you can't be what you can't see' but this is the other way round, 'you can be what you can see' and the pupils think 'that could be me'.
""Learning to dance like that in just three months is a massive achievement and will be the subject of many head teacher assemblies.""
He added that it was now their ""absolute dream"" for Yassin to attend their summer school prize giving.
""Everybody wants a bit of Hamza at the moment, but we've been giving him a lot of shout-outs on social media throughout the series and to perk him up before the final, so you never know,"" he said.
Unusually, the school can actually boast two Strictly contestants as the Reverend Richard Coles, who attended the school in the 1980s, took part in the 2017 dancing contest.
Less successful than Hamza, the former Communard was the second celebrity to be voted off that year.
Apart from stage schools, Mr Holman thinks they are probably the only mainstream school to claim that double, but he is prepared to be corrected.
""It's not normally a thing that a school celebrates but it shows our pupils have a certain creativity and can think outside the box,"" he said.

sports	Rugby World Cup: What next for England and the women's game?	"England captain Sarah Hunter said the latest Rugby World Cup made her feel like ""finally people are just waking up to how great our sport is"".
Rugby Football Union chief executive Bill Sweeney agreed, saying the nail-biting final was ""probably more entertaining than the men's game"".
urnament in New Zealand was the best-attended women's World Cup ever, breaking the attendance record for a women's matchday twice - the opening-day attendance of 34,235 surpassed by the 42,579 sell-out Eden Park crowd for the final.
A turning point for women's rugby, but there is more to come.
Here, BBC Sport explores some of the main questions concerning the future of the game and England's team after their fifth World Cup final loss to New Zealand.
None of the Red Roses have announced their retirement since the final, but 37-year-old Hunter has already confirmed she will stop playing before a home World Cup in 2025.
Abbie Ward - a key player in England's formidable line-out - says she will ""100%"" continue until the next World Cup, while star centre Emily Scarratt, who is 32, is undecided.
She said losing a second successive final to New Zealand was ""certainly a driving force to win a World Cup"".
Scarratt said: ""I said to my mum when I saw her and gave her a big hug: 'Brace yourself, we might have to do another three years of this.'
""It's definitely not a decision to be made now. We'll see.""
Head coach Simon Middleton has also lost two World Cup finals in a row, and he is yet to confirm whether he wants to stay at the helm.
Middleton, whose reign has included a record 30-Test winning streak and four successive Six Nations titles, has a contract until the end of the 2023 Women's Six Nations.
Sweeney told BBC Radio 5 Live it was ""important to have some continuity"" after the World Cup, adding it ""would be good to have a woman"" leading England ""at some point"".
He said there was ""a raft of coaches"" on the RFU's radar to succeed Middleton and confirmed he would discuss the head coach's future when he is back in England.
RFU has led the way in investing in women's rugby since giving the Red Roses full-time contracts in 2019.
Other sides, including Wales and New Zealand, are now following suit in making their women's teams professional.
Black Ferns were only given contracts earlier this year, and Sweeney said it was ""a bit disappointing"" they won the World Cup despite a comparative lack of investment.
With the game still growing, both the Red Roses and the World Cup in New Zealand were run at a loss.
But Sweeney said England's final loss ""won't change the views on investment"", adding 70% of the fans at Eden Park on Saturday were new followers for New Zealand Rugby and women's rugby ""is good for the overall health of the game"".
World Rugby chief executive Alan Gilpin said the success of the tournament in New Zealand had ""given us confidence to invest more"".
In two weeks, England's players can return to play for their clubs in the Premier 15s - the most competitive women's domestic league in the world, which is also benefiting from increased RFU investment.
r next international outing will be in the 2023 Women's Six Nations, which starts on 26 March 2023.
In that tournament, England will tour the country as they play in Newcastle and Northampton before a first standalone fixture at Twickenham against France in what is likely to be the decider.
About 20,000 tickets have been sold for the Twickenham game, and Sweeney is confident that number will reach 40,000 - half the stadium's capacity.
RFU is also hopeful it can host World Rugby's new women's competition WXV in 2024, in preparation for a home World Cup in 2025.
Sweeney is aiming for the 2025 World Cup to break even and says ""we will fill Twickenham"" for the final ""and hopefully for the semi-final as well"".
Before that, the plan is to host matches in different regions around the country in what Sweeney says will be ""the best ever women's World Cup""."	/sport/rugby-union/63619340
politics	Plaid Cymru: Adam Price concerned over claims of 'awful culture' in party	"Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has said he is ""concerned"" over claims of an ""awful culture"" in his party.
Mr Price promised to ask all party staff to share their experiences and said he would learn from them.
But he declined to comment on claims he knew of allegations against a party Senedd member a year ago.
Several sources have said there is substantial unease within the party about the way allegations have been dealt with.
Welsh Parliament's Standards Commissioner is investigating serious allegations made against Rhys ab Owen, MS for South Wales central.
Mr ab Owen is suspended in the meantime. Sources have claimed the allegations were in raised in Plaid a year ago.
BBC Wales also learned earlier this week the party has also commissioned a HR firm to look into misconduct allegations in Plaid Cymru, unrelated to Rhys ab Owen.
One source spoke of an ""awful culture"" in the party and a ""lack of leadership"".
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Drive with Gareth Lewis, Mr Price said: ""I've made it very clear that Plaid Cymru, like all parties, has to work to improve its culture and ensure that it has a safe and inclusive environment for everyone.
""I'm concerned to read this and we're committed to ensuring that we do practice those values of inclusivity and creating a safe space.
""As a result of these comments, we will be reaching out to all our staff, giving them a space to share their experiences confidentially.
""And we are committed, absolutely, to taking any necessary action as a consequence of learning from them.""

business	Low-deposit mortgage scheme extended for a year	"A mortgage guarantee scheme to help people get on the property ladder is to be extended by a year.
government said the programme, which was due to close at the end of December, would help buyers ""navigate difficult times"".
It was originally designed to encourage lenders to give home loans to people offering a 5% deposit - a product that was far less available during Covid.
Some lenders still play it safe as buyers face the rising cost of living.
Chief Secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: ""For hard-working families facing today's challenging economic conditions, it is right that we continue to help them secure their first home or move into their dream house.
""Extending this scheme means thousands more have the chance to benefit, and supports the market as we navigate through these difficult times.""
mortgage scheme has a £600,000 limit, and is primarily used to help first-time buyers.
95% loan-to-value mortgages are often seen as riskier by banks as they are more vulnerable to falling property prices, when there is a risk that people hold more debt than their home is worth.
Under the scheme, the government takes on some of the risk and compensates the lender for some of the loan if the property is repossessed.
It began in April last year, and the government said it had helped more than 24,000 households.
Some brokers have suggested the scheme had done its job by bringing more low-deposit mortgages onto the market, but others suggested only a small number of lenders had used the scheme.
Many mortgage providers generally only lend to those with a regular income, irrespective of any government incentive, and still carry out affordability checks.
Unemployment levels are expected to rise and the UK housing market is expected to slow. 
A recent survey by the Building Societies Association, suggested that 14% of people thought now was a good time to buy a property, but 47% did not think now was a good time to purchase a home."	/news/business-64031563
health	Malta moves to ease EU's last total ban on abortion	"Malta's government is to propose a change in the law to allow doctors to terminate a pregnancy if a mother's life or health is at risk.
mall Mediterranean state has the only total abortion ban in the EU.
Ministers promised to review the law when a US tourist was denied an abortion after she began to miscarry.
Andrea Prudente, who was 16 weeks pregnant, was told doctors could do nothing while the baby's heart was still beating.
Facing a potentially deadly infection she asked for an abortion and after days of waiting she was eventually allowed to fly to Spain.
Maltese Health Minister Chris Fearne said a legal amendment would go before parliament in the coming days to ensure doctors were now legally protected in cases of medical complication that left a mother's life at risk or her health in grave jeopardy due to the pregnancy.
Malta's criminal code currently says any doctor who knowingly provides a woman with the means for a termination faces a jail term of 18 months to four years and a permanent professional ban. Any woman who arranges her own termination is also liable to face jail, although no woman is thought to have faced criminal charges in years.
Last July Ms Prudente told the BBC that a midwife at Mater Dei hospital in Malta had told her that doctors might intervene ""when I would be on the 'brink of death'"". However, the head of the Malta College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said they would have never allowed her condition to deteriorate to that extent.
Pro-choice gynaecologist Isabel Stabile, one of 135 doctors in Malta who challenged the law, said the government had confirmed that the last blanket ban on abortion in the EU would end.
She said the change was a ""step in the right direction"" but did not go far enough: ""There will still not be any provision to terminate pregnancies in cases of rape or incest, or in cases of fatal, fetal anomaly."" 
minister said the spirit of the law and medical ethics was to save lives, so the change ensured that the principle was enshrined in law.
Prime Minister Robert Abela told The Times of Malta earlier this month that women had told him that he had to recognise the reality that women were unable to seek medical help if they suffered complications for fear of being sent to jail.
""These past months I've met tens of women who aborted using a tablet. Conservatively, around 300 or 350 women abort this way every year,"" he said. ""All these women told me the same thing: that they had been stigmatised and that none of them had found any sort of support.""
Malta is a predominantly Catholic country and a recent survey indicated 61.8% of people were completely opposed to abortion.
Some Maltese have argued that the law has acted as a deterrent. ""When mothers are faced with life-threatening conditions then doctors can intervene,"" Christian Briffa of anti-abortion youth group, I See Life, told the BBC during the summer.
But Justice Minister Jonathan Attard said the reform would remove any form of doubt and ensure patients received the best healthcare."	/news/world-europe-63650476
business	Diesel prices reach record of over £1.80 a litre	"UK diesel prices rose to a record of just over £1.80 a litre as efforts to stop importing fuel from Russia pushed up costs for retailers, the RAC said.
After the previous record of £1.79 was set in March following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, prices dipped but have risen again in recent weeks.
RAC said petrol prices went up by nearly 3p a litre since the start of May and were £1.66 a litre on average.
It said if EU members agreed to ban Russian oil, prices could rise further.
EU has been focusing for weeks on how to wean itself off Russian energy and has plans to phase out Russian crude oil over six months.
However, countries are split on how soon they wind down dependence - Hungary has rejected the proposal as unacceptable and the Czech and Slovak governments want a transition period.
UK is not as dependent on Russian oil as the EU is, however, almost a fifth of all UK diesel consumption was provided by Russian imports in 2020.
UK is also affected when global prices rise, despite its plans to stop Russian oil imports by the end of the year.
""Efforts to move away from importing Russian diesel have led to a tightening of supply and pushed up the price retailers pay for diesel,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams.
""Unfortunately, drivers with diesel vehicles need to brace themselves for yet more pain at the pumps."" 
In recent weeks, fuel sales have fallen as drivers have cut back on the number of journeys they make due to higher pump prices
Petrol station operator Ascona Group, which owns 60 UK petrol stations, said the amount of fuel it sold had dropped by 200,000 litres a week compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Managing director Darren Briggs said customers were making £20 to £30 fuel purchases ""last a little bit longer"".
Office for National Statistics revealed last week that the UK's economy shrank by 0.1% in March and said higher prices, including those at the petrol pumps, were ""really beginning to bite"".
wnturn came ahead of the impact of higher energy bills in April, which has sparked fears from analysts that the UK economy is at risk of a recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods - later this year.
Cutting diesel imports is tough
Analysis by Ben King, BBC business reporter
Cutting energy imports from Russia is a vital part of the West's plan to put the squeeze on the Putin regime and its war machine.
But when it comes to diesel, it's particularly tough - not least for the UK.
Diesel is produced by refining crude oil, and before the war, much of the UK's diesel supply was made in Russia and shipped to Britain in tankers.
Diesel supplies across the world were low before the crisis began, and the uncertainty surrounding the latest round of EU sanctions is helping to push those prices higher.
Most European countries are already reducing their imports of Russian oil and diesel - and imports from the Middle East and elsewhere are taking up some of the slack. But securing those extra supplies means paying higher prices. 
figures from the data firm Vortexa showed that just over half Europe's diesel imports were still coming from Russia. 
And the Asian head of the major oil trading firm Vitol, Mike Muller, warned earlier this month that EU rules which came into force on Sunday could make trading with Russia even harder, for instance by making it impossible to pay Russian suppliers.
's not likely to mean pumps running dry in the UK, says analyst Neil Crosby, who follows the diesel market for OilX.
""The UK itself may manage more or less to get by, but retail prices are not liable to cool any time soon,"" he said.  
In a bid to curb rising fuel prices, Chancellor Rishi Sunak cut the fuel duty by 5p a litre after previous record prices were seen in March.
RAC said then the cut was ""a drop in the ocean"" and now claimed drivers would be better off if had Mr Sunak reduced VAT on fuel.
""Had Mr Sunak reduced VAT to 15% as we called on him to do instead of cutting duty by 5p, drivers of diesel vehicles would be around 2p a litre better off, or £1 for every full tank,"" Mr Williams said.
""As it is, drivers are still paying 27p VAT on petrol and 29p on diesel, which is just the same as before the Spring Statement.""
reasury said it had introduced the ""biggest ever cut to all fuel duty rates - worth £5bn when taken together with the fuel duty freeze"".
""It will save the average UK car driver around £100, van driver around £200 and haulier over £1,500, based on average fuel consumption,"" a statement said.
government said businesses in general pay VAT on their sales but recover the tax on their purchases, meaning many can reclaim any VAT incurred when buying fuel.
rice of Brent crude oil - the global benchmark for prices - has soared in recent months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised concerns of potential global supply issues.
Ahead of the invasion, fuel prices had already been rising after demand increased following the reopening of economies from coronavirus lockdowns."	/news/business-61463280
health	Comedian Janey Godley reveals cancer has returned	"Comedian Janey Godley has revealed she will undergo cancer treatment just five months after announcing she was clear of the disease.
In a video posted on Twitter, Godley told her 276,000 followers she still intended to go on tour early next year.
But she admitted it could be the final time fans get the chance to see her perform on stage.
61-year-old Glaswegian confirmed last year that she had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer.
In an update on Tuesday she said treatment was ""back on the cards"" after evidence of the disease was recently found in her abdomen. As a result she will now undergo chemotherapy.
Despite the setback, Godley said she aimed to fulfil her 27-date Not Dead Yet tour in February and March.
It includes shows across Scotland, from Inverness to Galashiels, and concludes with three dates at the Leicester Square Theatre in London.
Godley said: ""I am determined to get back on stage.
""I have always been a kind of die on your feet no your knees type of person, you know me, so I'm looking forward to the tour.""
She then added: ""I think it is going to be fair and honest to say it might be the last time you'll see me live on stage.
""I am hoping it's no but I think it's a fair estimation that that will be what we are looking at.""
Godley explained her ovarian cancer was stage three and therefore treatable not curable.
rtainer also said she was being supported by the staff and specialists at The Beatson Cancer Centre in Glasgow.
She then turned back to her tour and said: ""I don't want to fade away. I want to go out with a bang. Are you ready to see me go out with a bang?
""I am not going sing My Way. It's no gonna be that kind of tour. There's going to be a lot of fun.""
Godley added that getting back on stage would be a ""dream come true"".
Stars including tennis legend Martina Navratilova and singer Curtis Stigers were among those who wished Godley well after her announcement.
In November last year the comedian confirmed she had been diagnosed after suffering from a bloated feeling in her stomach.
Godley, who found viral fame with her dubbed sketches about First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, urged anyone with symptoms to get them checked out.
Her pastiches of Ms Sturgeon's coronavirus news briefings gained her a massive social media following during the pandemic.
She featured in Scottish government coronavirus adverts but they were pulled after offensive historical tweets by her came to light."	/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-63964719
entertainment	Ukrainian post-apocalyptic opera to open Yorkshire festival	"mposer of a Ukrainian opera set in a post-apocalyptic world has said it is an honour to see it featured at a major UK festival.
Illia Razumeiko co-composed and co-directed Chornobyldorf alongside Roman Grygoriv, who also conducts the work for their company Opera Aperta.
ra, which was created in 2020, will open the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival on 18 November.
It combines folk and classical singing, physical theatre, dance and film.
Mr Razumeiko, 33, told the PA news agency from Kyiv: ""It's a special story because for two years we tried to speak about some kind of abstract post-apocalypse, which might come in 300 or 700 years.
""What happened in February (when Russia invaded Ukraine) was like some sort of post-apocalypse that we can see on our mobile phones and around us with our own eyes.""
He said that since the war began, the opera had become a ""diplomatic mission"" to show Ukraine exists.
""Our language exists, our culture exists, and it is distinct from Russian culture,"" he said.
ra includes seven video episodes, taken from expeditions the pair took to Chernobyl's prohibited zone and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.
""We visited different places in Ukraine and now literally all these places are battlefields and places where Russian war crimes have been committed,"" Mr Razumeiko said.
Chernobyl also played a pivotal role in the opera because it had a ""very special history and is 1,000 years old and has some interesting Ukrainian and Jewish history"", he added.
He also spoke about life in Kyiv and people's optimism despite the ongoing war.
""News about Ukraine liberating Kherson also means a lot because it is a place with theatres and festivals and lots of culture,"" he said.
Graham McKenzie, artistic director of the festival, said: ""Chornobyldorf is an astonishing work in any time. 
""When Illia Razumeiko and I started to speak about bringing the opera to the festival, neither of us could have imagined its very real and heightened significance for this moment, as the threat of nuclear war and the unimaginable aftermath stares us in the face.""

rackers share information about online activity, largely to target adverts.
Neeva has raised $77.5m (£68m) from investors. 
It offers free-to-use search, with other features such as password-manager access and virtual-private-network (VPN) service to be made available on a subscription basis. 
Users are asked to create an account, to build subscriptions at a later date.
And the UK price was likely to be about £5 per month, Mr Ramaswamy said.
""We felt the traditional search engines had become about advertising and advertisers - and not really about serving users,"" he said.
""Google has a dominant position in the marketplace - and the incentive for them to truly innovate, to truly create disruptive experiences, is not really there. 
""And then also as a company they feel obligated to show more and more revenue and profit to their shareholders, so they just keep increasing the number of ads.""
Search the word ""migraine"" on both Google and Neeva, and the first page of the results are fairly similar - links to news articles and factual information.
But with a brand, the difference becomes more stark. 
When I try ""BMW"", both search engines lead with links to the carmaker's website and Wikipedia entry.
But while Google follows with a map, social-media feeds and links to used-car dealers, Neeva sticks with different BMW official pages. 
Google certainly has more variety - but it is also blatantly pushing me towards buying a car.
Neeva's Chrome browser extension lists the trackers installed on web pages visited.
I tried a few:
And almost all - but not the BBC - had at least one belonging to Google, meaning Google is receiving anonymised information about users visiting those pages. 
While I had the extension activated, no ads displayed around the editorial content.
But ultimately, none of Neeva's other rivals has dented the dominance of Google search. 
""To Bing"" or ""to Duckduckgo"" - another privacy-focused service - are not verbs in the way ""to google"" is. 
And asked if Mr Ramaswamy could ever topple his former employer, Steph Liu, an analyst at Forrester specialising in privacy and search, said: ""Realistically, no.
""It's a sort of David and Goliath story. Google has too many users, it has too much revenue.
""The ultimate goal is to offer an alternative for the consumer base who are worried about their privacy, who don't want Google hoovering up their data and targeting ads based on their search history""."	/news/technology-63130364

entertainment	David Tennant jealous of incoming Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa	"Former Doctor Who star David Tennant says he's ""a little bit jealous"" of the incoming Doctor Ncuti Gatwa ""starting on this exciting journey.""
""Ncuti is brilliant,"" adds Tennant, who played the Doctor between 2005-2010. ""He's a lovely, lovely man and he's full of beans and he's really talented. I mean he's like scary-talented.
""So I'm thrilled for every Doctor Who fan for what's to come and I include myself in that number.""
In May the BBC announced that Tennant himself would be reprising the role as part of the show's 60th anniversary celebrations next year. Details are shrouded in secrecy but we know that he will be reunited with Catherine Tate, who played his companion Donna Noble.
And Tennant now tells the BBC how the reunion came about. ""It all slightly happened a little bit by accident,"" he reveals. And, strange as it may sound, Covid played a huge role. 
He, Tate and Russell T Davies, who was in charge of the hit sci-fi series between 2005 and 2009, got involved in Doctor Who: Lockdown! a worldwide series of online ""watch-alongs"" of previous episodes designed to pass the time during the pandemic, ""when everyone was locked in their house"".
""That's where this all started"", explains Tennant. 
""At a certain time and day everyone would press play on a certain episode and some of the people who had been involved in those episodes were tweeting along.
""I don't tweet but my wife helped me,"" he laughs.
rogramme, which is almost 60 years old, was being filmed in central Bristol
Afterwards the three of them ""were just having a text exchange and Catherine said, 'wouldn't it be fun to do it again?'""
He adds: ""Russell said, 'We could do a one off, maybe they'd let us'.""
""We said, 'yeah that would be a laugh,' and then it all went quiet.""
But last year Davies announced he was back as Doctor Who's showrunner. And Tennant and Tate received a surprising offer.
""Suddenly Russell let us know that he was taking over the show again and he would be back fully in charge and would we come and play a little bit for him?"" says Tennant.
""So I don't know if we gave him the idea to take Doctor Who back but certainly we thought if he's doing it, we can't let these young people have all the fun.""
Before we see him back on screen in Doctor Who though, Tennant is returning to the stage, for the first time in five years.
Next month he will star in CP Taylor's play Good, about a decent, respectable German professor, with a Jewish best friend, who becomes a high-ranking Nazi.
""When you look back at the historical events like what happened in Germany in the 1930s, yes there were some monsters but mostly it was a nation full of people that were as complex and different and broadly decent as most of us are,"" says Tennant. ""So what happened?"" 
was first performed in 1981, and in a revival at the Royal Exchange in Manchester in 2011, the Guardian's Lyn Gardner highlighted ""the fatal lack of dramatic tension in a play in which quite a nice man slips under with no struggle at all"".
But Tennant says Good will ask the audience hard questions because ""it sort of plonks you in the middle of this awful context and it makes you wonder how you would cope yourself"".
""One likes to think one is the true, virtuous crusading type of person. One fears one is the one that lets things slide past. [For instance] we are staring down the barrel of a terrible climate emergency, what am I really doing about that?""
And staging the work, the award-winning director Dominic Cooke says he has been struck by how timeless the themes of the play are. 
""What this play does is it allows you to identify with this very sort of decent, funny, charming person and watch him make compromises,"" he says. ""We all want to think that we are going to be the person that will stand up and say no when something terrible happens. 
""But the truth is that very few of us actually do.""
Good is on at London's Harold Pinter Theatre from 5 October to 24 December."	/news/entertainment-arts-63073710
sports	All-Ireland Club Hurling: St Thomas' Fintan Burke says clash with World Cup final 'doesn't matter'	"Sunday afternoon will mean only one thing for the majority of sports fans throughout the world. For four hurling teams in Ireland, however, it will mean something very different.
At around lunchtime, a worldwide TV audience of potentially more than a billion people will be making final preparations to watch the World Cup final.
Whether it is making sure snacks are at hand by the sofa at home or heading out to a bar, supporters from across the globe will be watching on to see if Argentina captain Lionel Messi can crown his international career by leading his country to World Cup glory in Qatar.
Not so for everyone associated with St Thomas', Dunloy, Ballyhale Shamrocks and Ballygunner, the four clubs that will contest the All-Ireland club hurling finals at the GAA's Croke Park headquarters in Dublin. 
Connacht champions St Thomas' take on Ulster winners Dunloy at 13:30 GMT - 90 minutes before Messi and co kick-off in the Lusail Stadium - with the champions of Leinster and Munster, Shamrocks Ballyhale and Ballygunner, throwing in at 15:30.     
And, what about the prospect of going head-to-head for attention with an occasion that Fifa said was watched by a combined global audience of 1.12 billion in 2018?   
""It doesn't really matter to us because we are all hurling men,"" St Thomas' Fintan Burke said in a matter-of-fact fashion. 
""To be honest with you, it wouldn't really affect us. We don't care if there are only two people watching our game on telly. It doesn't affect us and we don't let it affect us.""
It's worth noting that the GAA has previous for its own flagship events being scheduled at the same time as major sporting occasions.
In June 2002, for example, Derry and Donegal played out the first half of their Ulster semi-final at a largely-empty St Tiernach's Park in Clones while fans opted to watch the Republic of Ireland's World Cup last-16 defeat by Spain on penalties. 
GAA stuck with its original throw-in time, which meant supporters had a choice to make when the Republic-Spain game went to extra-time and a shootout. 
governing body had a different approach four years later when the K Club hosted the Ryder Cup, with the All-Ireland football final being moved from its original date to avoid competing with the biennial USA-Europe showdown.
St Thomas' lost to Ballyhale Shamrocks in last year's All-Ireland semi-final but have made it through to this stage again by winning their fifth consecutive Galway title, beating Loughrea in the final. 
ub are aiming for what would be a second All-Ireland title after claiming their first in 2013 and, while some members of the current panel were in that squad, Burke and the majority of his team-mates were not.
""For a lot of us, we don't have an All-Ireland medal,"" he continued.
""I think there are 25 of the whole panel who are without one and the older lads are not shy in letting us know that we don't have one, either. 
""It would be nice to just get one and to have one in your back pocket when you retire - it's not something that many people have.""   
uccessful in their All-Ireland bid, St Thomas' will have to overcome a Dunloy team that won their first Ulster club title since 2009 with victory over holders Slaughtneil in a thrilling final.
Burke watched that match, which Dunloy won 2-12 to 0-16, and was full of praise for the quality of hurling teams in Ulster.
""Every year good teams come out of Ulster, you don't win it easily as there are a lot of good teams there,"" he said. 
""We have seen that through the years. Having played three or four of them we know the level that Dunloy are going to be at. 
""Having played Loughrea twice in the last few weeks, they are similar to them - quick, they run and are good, sharp-shooting hurlers. Hopefully that might stand us in good stead."" 
Burke is one of four brothers in the St Thomas' panel and the family ties extend even further, with his older brother, Kenneth, the team's manager.
He was clear that there is no conflict of interest for any of the family and also added that, while hurling is hugely important to everyone in the squad, family and friends take priority.
""We are probably old enough now to realise he [Kenneth] has a horrible job at the best of times without us making it any more difficult for him,"" he commented.
""The respect is there, you leave the family at home. The respect is there on the hurling side, too, when you see what he has done and all that he has achieved for the club. It means you have enough respect to not question him, go against him or make his life difficult.""
He added: ""We have our values when it comes to hurling but it is only a sport. Family and friends are more important. 
""Hurling is great and we love it, it is what we live and die for, but I suppose we are all best friends, everyone on the panel. 
""We would do anything for each other and we would help each other out off the field as well as on it. To be honest, family comes first and it always will. Your health is your wealth and hurling only comes afterwards if you are able to do it.""   "	/sport/gaelic-games/63973638
entertainment	Newcastle artist creates huge floor mural on disused quayside bus lane	"A street artist has created a huge, 90-metre (300ft) floor mural along a city's quayside.
Alex Mulholland painted the work on the disused bus lane by the River Tyne over three weeks.
mural is ""the longest pavement art installation in Newcastle and to our knowledge in the UK"", business development agency NE1 said.
Mr Mulholland said it was a ""bit of a pinch me moment"" to have his work ""in front of the best view in the world"".
graphic designer, commonly known as Mul, said it was his most demanding mural to date.
""I think the weather was definitely the biggest challenge to overcome,"" he said.
mural is the first Mr Mullholland has drawn on the ground. His previous work can be seen on the sides of buildings across Ouseburn and the city centre.
""It was difficult and way more challenging than a wall but I picked it up quite quickly and just cracked on with it,"" he said.

Because of the scale of the project, Mr Mulholland enlisted the help of other artists, friends and family.
""I couldn't have done this project without all of the people assisting me to help paint,"" he said.
mural was commissioned by Newcastle City Council and business improvement agency NE1, which said it wanted to ""celebrate the quayside and draw attention"" to what it offers.
Chief executive Stephen Patterson said: ""Newcastle is a vibrant and dynamic city, and the quayside is an iconic location - it's important that the artwork reflects this and has a local connection.""
Mr Mullholland said he had decided to call the painting Nothing Serious.
""That's what we were telling all of the people walking by what it meant and what it was for,"" he said.
""Just a bit of colour, a bit of fun, to brighten the place up and definitely Nothing Serious.""

technology	Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes jailed for fraud	"ranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has been sentenced to over 11 years in prison for defrauding investors in her blood testing start-up that was once valued at $9bn (£7.5bn).
former Silicon Valley star falsely claimed the technology could diagnose disease with just a few drops of blood. 
Holmes, 38, who is pregnant, tearfully told the court she felt ""deep pain"" for those misled by the scam.
She was found guilty in January after a three-month trial.
Holmes is expected to appeal against the sentence, which was handed down on Friday in a California court. 
Once hailed as the ""next Steve Jobs"", she was at one time said to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire.
She launched Theranos after dropping out of Stanford University at age 19, and its value rose sharply after the company claimed it could bring about a revolution in disease diagnosis.
But the technology Holmes touted did not work and - awash in lawsuits - the company was dissolved by 2018.
At Holmes' trial in San Jose, California, prosecutors said she knowingly misled doctors and patients about Theranos' flagship product - the Edison machine - which the company claimed could detect cancer, diabetes and other conditions using just a few drops of blood.
used Holmes of vastly exaggerating the firm's performance to its financial backers.
Jurors ultimately found her guilty on four counts of fraud, with a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. But they found her not guilty on four other charges, and failed to reach a verdict on three more.
Before Judge Edward Davila issued his sentence on Friday, Holmes read a speech to the court in which she tearfully apologised to investors and patients.
rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes
""I am devastated by my failings. I have felt deep pain for what people went through, because I failed them,"" she said. 
""I regret my failings with every cell of my body,"" she continued. 
judge referred to Holmes as a ""brilliant"" entrepreneur, and told her: ""Failure is normal. But failure by fraud is not OK."" 
Silicon Valley is a place where fortunes can be made and squandered. It's not unusual for investors to lose big sums of money. 
It's also not unusual for founders to make grandiose claims about their tech. 
What is different about Holmes' case, though, is that Theranos' unwinding actually led to fraud charges that stuck. 
It is notoriously difficult to get successful prosecutions in cases of white-collar fraud in the US. 
When investors lose money, they often simply write it off, or pursue compensation privately. 
Holmes' punishment is a warning for Silicon Valley executives that there are real consequences for misleading investors.  
't a slap on the wrist, it's significant time in prison. 
She is required to surrender to begin serving her sentence on 27 April. 
Holmes and Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, her former business partner and lover, were charged in 2018 with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Balwani, who was tried separately, was found guilty of fraud this summer. He will be sentenced next month.
Prosecutors requested that she face 15 years in prison and pay some $800m in restitution to investors, including several high-profile figures such as former US Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who testified against her at the trial, and software tycoon Larry Ellison. 
But Holmes' defence team - who argued she was well-intentioned and trying to help people - said she should spend 18 months under house arrest.
judge on Friday determined that she had caused $121m in losses to investors, including Rupert Murdoch and the family that owns Walmart. The amount she will be required to repay will be determined at a later court hearing. 
Over 130 friends, family and former Theranos employees wrote to the judge to appeal for clemency.
group noted that Holmes is a young mother. She had a son in July 2021 and is currently pregnant with her second child. 
It is not known when she is due to give birth. Her lawyers are expected to try to keep her from entering prison until after the baby is born. 
Her partner Billy Evans, in his sentencing memo to the court, told the judge that he fears for ""a future in which my son grows up with a relationship with his mother on the other side of glass armed by guards"".
Eileen Lepera, a Silicon Valley secretary who lost a chunk of her life savings by investing in Theranos, told the BBC she was ""happy"" with the sentence.
""I think it's fair, considering all the facts of the case,"" Ms Lepera said. ""She [Holmes] knew it was fraud, and she put people's lives at risk."""	/news/world-us-canada-63685131
sports	Rocky Fielding misses weight for British and Commonwealth light-heavyweight title bout	"Rocky Fielding has missed the weight for his British and Commonwealth light-heavyweight championship bout against Dan Azeez.
Fielding, 35, weighed in a pound over the 175lbs limit but the fight will still go ahead in Bournemouth.
Azeez can add the Commonwealth belt to the British title he already holds, but Fielding cannot win either title.
""I don't read too much into the weight. It is what it is,"" Azeez said of his opponent's failure to make weight.
""Whether he comes over the weight, under the weight, we've still got Saturday night to deal with and that's what I'm focused on.""
fight in Bournemouth is part of the card headlined by hometown fighter Chris Billam-Smith's cruiserweight bout against Kosovo's Armend Xhoxhaj.
Were Fielding to win on Saturday, Azeez would remain the British champion and the Commonwealth title would stay vacant.
Azeez, 33, faces his toughest test to date in the form of former WBA (Regular) super-middleweight champion Fielding.
Fielding is 30-2 in his career, with his only defeats against then-world champions Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and Callum Smith at super-middleweight.
Azeez is undefeated in 17 fights and has slowly made a name for himself in the division since dismantling Hosea Burton in November 2021."	/sport/boxing/63988054
