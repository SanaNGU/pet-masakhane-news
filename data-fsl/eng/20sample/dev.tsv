health	Top hospitals targeted by nurse strikes	"A host of leading hospitals will be affected in next month's nurse strikes, the Royal College of Nursing says.
ude Great Ormond Street and Alder Hey children's hospitals and leading cancer centres.
Overall, around a quarter of hospitals and community services in England and nearly all those in Northern Ireland and Wales will see nurses walkout on 15 and 20 December.
Emergency care will continue to be provided during the strike action.
In total, 76 NHS organisations will see nurses walk out.
ude leading cancer centres the Royal Marsden and Liverpool's Clatterbridge centre alongside major hospitals in Birmingham, London, Liverpool, Newcastle and West Yorkshire.
All the health boards in Northern Ireland and all-but-one in Wales, the Aneurin Bevan, will see strike action take place.
But action has been suspended in Scotland after ministers there made a fresh pay offer, which the RCN is consulting on.
Meanwhile, Unison has announced ambulance staff including paramedics and call handlers, have voted to strike in five of England's 10 ambulance services. A walkout is expected before Christmas.
urnout was too low in the remainder for the votes to count, as well as in all but two of England's hospital and community trusts.
No services in Wales voted for strike action, but a walkout will happen across all services in Northern Ireland on 12 December, Unison said.
Overall, up to 100,000 nurses could be involved in the nurse walkout the RCN says, which would amount to about a quarter of nurses in those three nations.
RCN warned the government if a deal could not be agreed more services would be involved in the strike action next year.
RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: ""Ministers have declined my offer of formal pay negotiations and instead chosen strike action.
""It has left us with no choice. Nursing is standing up for the profession and their patients. 
""We've had enough of being taken for granted and being unable to provide the care patients deserve.""
Watch this video quiz to test your knowledge of nurses' pay
rike action will last from 08:00 to 20:00 GMT.
Under trade union laws, the RCN has to ensure life-preserving care
kely to mean some cancer services, urgent tests and scans and ongoing care for vulnerable patients will be protected alongside A&E and intensive care - although it will be up to local health bosses and union leaders to negotiate exact staffing levels on strike days.
But it seems almost certain the walkout will increase the backlog in non-urgent hospital treatment - a record seven million people are already on the waiting list in England.
GP services, however, will be unaffected as nurses working in practices were not entitled to take part in the ballot.
In England, the RCN only has mandates for strike action in just over half of NHS trusts as the turnout was too low in the rest.
For the forthcoming strikes the union's leadership has decided to only announce walkouts in around half of those eligible to take action.
RCN has called for a rise of 5% above the RPI inflation rate, which currently stands at above 14%, but no UK nation has offered close to that.
In England and Wales, NHS staff, including nurses, have been given a rise of at least Â£1,400 - worth about 4% on average for nurses.
In Northern Ireland, nurses are yet to receive a pay award because there is no working government.
Earlier this month Scottish ministers made a fresh offer worth more than 8% for a newly-qualified nurse, with more senior nurses being offered less. This prompted the re-starting of talks.
During the ballot - the results of which were announced two weeks ago - the RCN had argued this year's below-inflation pay award came after years of squeezes on nurse's salaries. 
But England Health Secretary Steve Barclay has said the RCN's demands are not affordable.
He has said the government had met the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in giving its award.
And it followed a 3% pay rise last year, in recognition of work during the pandemic, despite a public-sector pay freeze.
Welsh government said it was unable to enter pay talks without extra funding from the UK government.
will only be the second time RCN members have been on strike.
In 2019, nurses in Northern Ireland walked out over pay, while nurses who are members of Unison in England walked out in 2014 over pay.
A host of other major health unions, including Unison, the Royal College of Midwives, GMB and Unite, have all started balloting members."	/news/health-63799244
technology	What is behind the big tech companies' job cuts?	"first sign of job cuts at Amazon came from LinkedIn posts from laid-off employees.
, Amazon's devices boss, Dave Limp, announced: ""It pains me... We will lose talented Amazonians from the devices & services org"".
Across the tech industry, at firms like Twitter, Meta, Coinbase and Snap, workers have announced they are ""seeking new opportunities"".
Worldwide, more than 120,000 jobs have been lost, according to the Layoffs.fyi website, which tracks tech job cuts.
Different firms cut employees for different reasons but there are common themes.
As our lives moved online during the pandemic, the tech giants' businesses boomed, and executives believed the good times - for them - would continue to roll.
Meta, for example, took on more than 15,000 people in the first nine months of this year.
Now executives announcing cuts have said they miscalculated.
""I made the decision to significantly increase our investments,"" chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees, as he laid off 13% of them.
""Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.""
Online adverts are the chief source of income for many tech firms, but for the advertising business, dark clouds have been gathering. Firms have faced growing opposition to intrusive advertising practices. For example, Apple made it harder to track people's online activity and sell that data to advertisers. 
And as the economy ran into trouble, many firms slashed their online advertising budgets.
In the financial technology sector, rising interest rates have also hit companies.
""It's been a really a disappointing quarter of earnings for many of the big tech companies,"" said technology analyst Paolo Pescatore of PP Foresight. ""No-one's immune.""
Even Apple has signalled caution, with chief executive Tim Cook saying the firm was ""still hiring"", but only on a ""deliberate basis."" 
Amazon attributed its job cuts to an ""unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment"" forcing it to prioritize on what mattered most to customers.
""As part of our annual operating planning review process, we always look at each of our businesses and what we believe we should change,"" spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. 
""As we've gone through this, given the current macro-economic environment (as well as several years of rapid hiring), some teams are making adjustments, which in some cases means certain roles are no longer necessary. We don't take these decisions lightly, and we are working to support any employees who may be affected.""
Investors have also piled on the pressure to cut costs, accusing firms of being bloated and slow to respond to signs of slowdown.
In an open letter to Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, activist investor Sir Christopher Hohn urged the firm to slash jobs and pay.
Alphabet had to be more disciplined about costs, he wrote, and cut losses from projects like its self-driving car company, Waymo.
Elon Musk is certainly of the view that there is room to cut costs at his latest investment, Twitter, which has struggled to either turn a profit or attract new users.
Added to that, many commentators argue Mr Musk paid over the odds for the firm, and the pressure is on to make his investment worthwhile.
He laid off half the firm's employees; and for those who remain an ""extreme"" work ethic is promised.
According to US media reports on Tuesday, Mr Musk told staff they needed to commit to a ""hardcore"" culture of ""long hours at high intensity"" or leave. 
Industry watcher Scott Kessler also says there is less tolerance for big spending on high-tech gambles like virtual reality or driverless cars that may not pay off in the short term.
Investors also see the high wages and cushy perks some enjoy in the industry as unsustainable.
""Some companies have had to face harsh realities,"" he said.
Mike Morini, from WorkForce Software, which provides digital management tools said it appeared to be a turning point.
""The tech industry is exiting a period of growth at all costs,"" he said.
But while the big tech firms may be buffeted by economic headwinds, they are not broken.
Amazon's proposed 10,000 job cuts in corporate and technology roles - its biggest such reduction to date - represents only 3% of its office staff.
And the lay-offs may also be the start of new businesses as talented staff, dumped by the big firms, join or create start-ups.
As veteran Silicon Valley watcher Mike Malone recently told the BBC: ""I won't write the Valley off yet. I still have a lot of hope."""	/news/technology-63635821
sports	MLB: New York Yankees' Aaron Judge breaks American League home run record	"Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees has set a new American League record with his 62nd home run of the season.
utfielder, 30, passed the 61-year-old single-season mark set by another Yankee, Roger Maris, in the first inning away to the Texas Rangers.
Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants has the overall MLB record of 73, set in 2001 in the National League.
""It's a big relief,"" said Judge, who claimed the record with one regular season game remaining.
""Everybody can finally sit down in their seats now and watch the ball game.
""It's been a fun ride so far. Getting the chance to do this with my team-mates and with the constant support from my family, it's been a great honour.""
Judge drew level with Maris last week against the Toronto Blue Jays before playing five fruitless games, including two against the Rangers.
But he made no mistake this time as he led off the hitting, going clear of Maris with the third pitch faced from Jesus Tinoco.
""Congratulations to Aaron Judge and his family on Aaron's historic home run number 62,"" tweeted Maris' son, Roger Maris Jr.external-link
""It has definitely been a baseball season to remember. You are all class and someone who should be revered.""
record-breaking ball was claimed by a fan in the stands and has been valued at about $2m (Â£1.75m).
""I don't know where the ball's at, so we'll see what happens with that,"" said Judge.
""It would have been great to get it back but that's a souvenir for a fan. They made a great catch out there and they've got every right to it.""
Judge was a first-round draft pick by the Yankees in 2013 and made his MLB debut in 2016, hitting 52 home runs in his first full season.
In July he became the second-fastest player to reach 200 career home runs and he now has 219 from 727 games."	/sport/baseball/63103884

technology	How solar farms in space might beam electricity to Earth	"It sounds too good to be true: a plan to harvest solar energy from space and beam it down to Earth using microwaves.
But it's something that could be happening as soon as 2035, according to Martin Soltau, the co-chairman at Space Energy Initiative (SEI) - a collaboration of industry and academics.
SEI is working on a project called Cassiopeia, which plans to place a constellation of very large satellites in a high Earth orbit.
Once deployed the satellites would harvest solar energy and beam it back down to Earth.
He says the potential is almost unlimited.
""In theory it could supply all of the world's energy in 2050,"" he says. 
""There's sufficient room in orbit for the solar power satellites, and the Sun's supply of energy is vast. A narrow strip around geostationary Earth orbit receives more than 100 times the amount of energy per year than all of humanity is forecast to use in 2050,"" Mr Soltau says.
Earlier this year, the UK government announced Â£3m in funding for space-based solar power (SBSP) projects, following an engineering study conducted by consultancy Frazer-Nash that concluded the technology was viable.
SEI is hoping to get a big chunk of that money.
Its satellites would be made up of hundreds of thousands of small, identical modules produced in factories on Earth, and assembled in space by autonomous robots, who would also carry out servicing and maintenance.
r energy collected by the satellites would be converted into high frequency radio waves and beamed to a rectifying antenna on Earth, which would convert the radio waves into electricity.
Each satellite could deliver around 2GW of power into the grid, making each satellite comparable in power output to a nuclear power station.
Here on Earth, sunlight is diffused by the atmosphere, but in space it comes directly from the sun without interference.
So a space-based solar panel can collect a lot more energy than a similar sized one on Earth.
Similar projects are under development elsewhere.
In the US, for example, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is working on some of the critical technologies needed for such a system, in a project known as Space Solar Power Incremental Demonstrations and Research (SSPIDR). 
ude improving solar cell efficiencies, solar-to-radio frequency conversion and beam forming, as well as reducing the large temperature fluctuations on spacecraft components and creating designs for deployable structures.
Late last year, the team successfully demonstrated new components for a so-called sandwich tile, which is used to convert solar energy into radio waves.
So is it safe to beam energy back to earth?
In a 2009 reportNasa scientist James Logan looked at the safety issues. In his report, he said the intensity of a typical space-based microwave beam would reach 30mW/cm2 at the centre - around 3% as strong as a typical counter-top microwave oven. 
At its perimeter, the energy from the beam would be around the same as the amount of radiation that current standards allow to leak up to 5cm away from a microwave oven. 
Although birds might be able to detect the microwave beams, the beams could ""never even come close to 'cooking' birds in flight"", the report said.
More technology of business:
While many of the biggest hurdles have already been cleared, there are still potential problems.
""My personal take on this is that we like to think the technology is there, but it's not quite ready yet for us to embark on a project of such complexity,"" says Dr Jovana Radulovic, a thermodynamics lecturer at the University of Portsmouth, who specialises in renewable energy systems.
She makes the point that launching a large number of solar panels into space will be expensive and, given that any project could require hundreds of launches, it would generate a lot of carbon dioxide.
But there is cause for optimism. An environmental analysis of the Cassiopeia project by the University of Strathclyde has concluded that overall, including launch, the carbon footprint could be as little as half that of terrestrial solar, at about 24g of CO2 per kilowatt-hour.  
Meanwhile, says Mr Soltau, the economic case is improving all the time.
""The cost of launch has fallen by 90% and is continuing to fall, and this has been game-changing for the economics,"" he says. 
""Secondly, there have been some real advances in the design of solar power satellites, so that they're much more modular, which provides resilience and reduced production costs. Thirdly, we've got real advances in robotics and autonomous systems.""
With only limited funding from the UK government, SEI is hoping to attract private investment for some of the technologies involved. However, warns Dr Radulovic, the proposed timeline may be over-optimistic.
""I think with significant investment and focused effort into this area, there's no reason why we couldn't have the system up and running as smaller pilot projects in the foreseeable future,"" she says. 
""But something on a large scale - we are talking about kilometres of solar arrays - would take a substantially longer time."""	/news/business-62636746
health	Fresh nurse strike dates announced in England	"Nurses will go on strike again on 18 and 19 January in England unless pay talks are opened, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has said.
Nurses at more hospital trusts than before will be involved in the strike action in the new year, the union said.
Meanwhile, the GMB union has called off a second day of ambulance strikes planned in England and Wales for 28 December.
But it announced a new co-ordinated walkout on 11 January. 
wo days of nurses strikes were held in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 15 and 20 December, which resulted in more than 40,000 patient appointments and procedures being rescheduled.
On two consecutive days in January, there will be 12-hour walkouts by nurses at 55 health trusts in England - around a quarter.
Pat Cullen, head of the RCN, said the union had been left ""with no choice"" but to arrange January strikes.
""The government had the opportunity to end this dispute before Christmas but instead they have chosen to push nursing staff out into the cold again in January,"" Ms Cullen said. 
""The public support has been heart-warming and I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do for patients and the future of the NHS.""
Health Secretary Steve Barclay said he was ""disappointed"" by the decision to take further strike action. He said meeting unions' pay demands would mean money being taken away from frontline services, causing delays to patients' treatment.
""Strikes are in no one's best interest, least of all patients, and I urge unions to reconsider further strike action before walkouts have a worse impact on patients,"" he added. 
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was ""really sad"" about the disruption being caused ""to so, so many people's lives, particularly at Christmas time.""
But he insisted he had ""acted fairly and reasonably"" in accepting public sector pay recommendations and could not risk inflation rising any further.

In Scotland, NHS workers are to be awarded an average pay increase of 7.5% - but nurses are still expected to announce strike dates in the new year. They rejected the pay deal, alongside midwives and staff belonging to the GMB union.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the deal was ""the biggest since devolution"" and he had no more money for pay this year - but he said he was prepared to meet unions during the festive period to stop further strike action.
Royal College of Midwives says its members in Scotland may also take action in 2023.
Up to 10,000 ambulance members were expected to walk out on Wednesday 28 December. 
union said it was scrapping the action next week so that ""the public will be able to enjoy Christmas without additional anxiety"".
f strike action on 11 January means GMB workers will again be striking on the same day as ambulance workers represented by Unison. 
It means thousands of paramedics, call handlers and technicians will walk out in nine of England's 10 trusts, and across Wales in the new year.
Unison said yesterday it planned two more days of strikes on 11 and 23 January in London, Yorkshire, the North West, North East and South West.
unions say they want the government to come to the table and negotiate pay in order to help retain staff and improve patient care.
Rachel Harrison, GMB National Secretary, said they were suspending action on 28 December because they had been overwhelmed by ""amazing public support"".
But she said the new January strike date showed the union's commitment to getting higher pay for ambulance staff was ""stronger than ever"".
""The government can now do what ambulance workers and the public want - get round the table and talk pay now. We are here 24/7. Any time, any place,"" she said.  
A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We will continue to work to bring together trade unions, employers and government to deliver the best possible outcomes for workers, while continuing to call on the UK government to use the funding it has to provide a fair pay offer to NHS staff and enable us to do the same in Wales.""

entertainment	Theatre group pulls play from Sheffield's Crucible over controversial musical	"A theatre company has pulled a play from Sheffield's Crucible in response to the staging of a musical criticised for its portrayal of Vietnamese people.
New Earth, a group of British East and South East Asian artists, said Miss Saigon contained ""damaging tropes, misogyny and racism"".
Its own production, Worth, had been due to run before the musical in June.
Sheffield Theatres, which runs the Crucible, said it respected the decision to cancel the play.
ue's creative directors acknowledged Miss Saigon's ""divisive performance history"" and ""the upset it has caused"".
In a statement they said they had approached the new production being ""sensitive"" to the issue, adding they ""believe this is a chance for us to engage in a fresh way with a majority East and South East Asian company reframing the story"".
Miss Saigon, which tells the story of the relationship between a young Vietnamese sex worker and an American soldier during the Vietnam War, sparked anger when it first opened in London's West End in 1989 with white actors wearing eye prostheses to make them look more Asian.
Written by Claude-Michel SchÃ¶nberg and Alain Boublil and based on Giacomo Puccini's 1904 opera Madame Butterfly, it later transferred to Broadway and won multiple prizes including two Laurence Olivier and three Tony awards.
New Earth said Miss Saigon ""remains a very contentious musical since its release over thirty years ago, having hurt and angered many viewers due to its highly problematic narrative and portrayal of the Vietnam War and Vietnamese people"".
""We recognise concerns from our team that working alongside a musical that perpetuates deeply held notions of Asian inferiority would impact their wellbeing,"" added a joint statement from the company and Chester-based co-producers Storyhouse.
BEATS, an advocacy group for British East and South East Asian theatre workers, said Miss Saigon ""fetishised and hyper-sexualised"" Vietnamese women and erased ""the real experience of war and violence suffered by millions"".
It called the Crucible's decision to stage the musical in July ""deeply traumatising"".
Robert Hastie and Anthony Lau, directors of the Crucible's production of Miss Saigon, said they had taken a ""new approach"" which they hoped would ""shift the perspective"" on the show.
""The reimagining of any classic is about viewing stories through new lenses, that speak to the world as it is today as much as what it was or might have been,"" they added in a joint statement.

Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group, will put up the interest rates on a range of deals for new borrowers to well over 5%.
It follows a string of major providers in re-pricing products, which has pushed the average two-year fixed rate deal to 6%.

Brokers say lenders are ""playing safe"" with rates amid current economic uncertainty, but costs could eventually start to dip.

On the morning of the speech it was 4.74%. Now, it is 5.97%. A five-year fixed deal has typically risen from 4.75% to 5.75% over the same period.
In recent days, the biggest lenders have revised their prices. 
On Wednesday, the largest of them - the Halifax - will increase its own. A spokesman said this was to ""reflect the continued increase in mortgage market pricing over recent weeks"".
It means its rate for a two-year fixed deal for a customer offering a 25% deposit is up from 4.61% to 5.84%.
On a 30-year mortgage for somebody borrowing Â£200,000, that would mean a monthly repayment of Â£1,179 rather than Â£1,026.
Similar shocks to the mortgage sector in the past have led to lenders pursuing a ""flight to quality"", according to Andrew Montlake, of mortgage broker Coreco.
means lenders have concentrated their attention on borrowers able to offer large deposits and absolute certainty of repaying.
He said the current upheaval is likely to be a relatively short-term issue with lenders scrambling to reset prices, rather than a longer-term problem.
Lenders were playing safe with their rates, he added. Notably, the TSB has a stricter test of affordability - checking whether homeowners can cope were rates to rise to 8% (or 7% for first-time buyers) before accepting an application.
Some more specialist lenders, whose customers may include those with a chequered credit history or the recently self-employed, have been raising rates to 6.5-7% or more.
group of customers may be the one that finds their choice of products is curtailed.
Mr Montlake said there was still high demand from borrowers, and money available for providers to lend.
Economic clarity provided by clear forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility should eventually feed through to stop the increase, or see some reversal in mortgage rates, he said.
rospect has already improved the value of the pound.
Some brokers are worried that first-time buyers offering a 5% deposit could find it more difficult to find a deal.
""The 95% loan-to-value mortgage won't die, but there will almost certainly be fewer of them due to the current economic situation,"" said Ian Hewett, founder of Ashford-based The Bearded Mortgage Broker.
""Equally, I am sure they will be resurrected once stability is back and confidence in the government has resumed.""

business	Government is undercutting UK institutions, says former Bank governor	"Mark Carney said the government was ""working at cross-purposes with the Bank""
Former Bank of England governor Mark Carney has accused the government of ""undercutting"" the UK's key economic institutions. 
Mr Carney told the BBC the government's tax-cutting measures were ""working at some cross-purposes"" with the Bank.
He also pointed to a decision not to publish economic forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) alongside Friday's ""mini-budget"".
mini-budget sparked turmoil on financial markets and hit the pound.
Investors had been demanding a much higher return for investing in government bonds, causing some to halve in value. Pension funds, which invest in bonds, were forced to start selling, sparking fears of a fresh market downturn.
Bank of England was forced to step in to calm markets and on Wednesday, said it would buy Â£65bn of government bonds over the next fortnight in an attempt to restore stability. 
Sterling hit a record low against the US dollar of around $1.03 on Monday. It has since risen to around $1.08 after the Bank's announcement and remained there after Prime Minister Liz Truss said she would stand by the measures announced in the mini-budget. 
f government borrowing, however, edged higher and the interest paid - or yield - on 10-year government debt rose. 
Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Carney said that while the government was right to want to boost economic growth: ""There is a lag between today and when that growth might come."" 
He said: ""There was an undercutting of some of the institutions that underpin the overall approach - so not having an OBR forecast is much-commented upon and the government, I think, has accepted the need for that but that was important.""
OBR provides independent forecasts of the impact of government's plans on the economy as well as on public finances. The Treasury decided not to publish its forecasts on Friday, which fuelled market turmoil.
""Unfortunately having a partial budget, in these circumstances - tough global economy, tough financial market position, working at cross-purposes with the Bank - has led to quite dramatic moves in financial markets,"" Mr Carney said. 
reasury has subsequently said the OBR will release a full forecast when Mr Kwarteng announces his medium-term fiscal plan on 23 November.
Mr Carney also said that the government's mini-budget showed it was ""working at some cross-purposes with the Bank in terms of short-term support for the economy"".
Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng unveiled the country's biggest tax package in 50 years on Friday. But the Â£45bn-worth of tax cuts has sparked concerns that government borrowing could surge along with rising interest rates.
Bank has a target to keep inflation at 2%. But prices are rising at their fastest rate in four decades and the Bank has been lifting interest rates to cool inflation. 
Since the mini-budget, some economists believe interest rates could rise faster and higher, to as much as 6% by next May.
At the helm of the Bank of England until 2020, Mark Carney was charged with rebuilding the reputation of British financial systems after the crash of 2008. 
While it is not usual for former governors to comment on current issues, his stark words will be a further blow to the government as it defends its tax cuts. Mr Carney has indicated that the fall-out from these plans, by contributing to market turmoil, has consequences that may damage rather than enhance prosperity.
Bank of England has been forced to inject billions of pounds into bond markets. That is after a plunge in their value threatened the viability of the pensions funds that manage workers' retirement pots. 
During times such as the the financial crisis to the pandemic, the Bank of England has, on occasion, provided emergency help to ease global shocks. Doing so to offset the consequences of domestic government policy is far more rare.
With the markets remaining uneasy, analysts say an emergency interest rate hike can't be ruled out.
Ms Truss insisted that the government's plan was ""right"".
In her first remarks since Friday's announcement, Ms Truss told the BBC: ""Of course there are elements of controversy, as there always are.""
But she said: ""This is the right plan that we've set out.""
On Wednesday, Treasury Minister Andrew Griffith said that every major country ""is dealing with exactly the same issues"" as the UK such as Russia's war with Ukraine and the effect on energy prices. 
But while Mr Carney conceded that the global economy is ""going through some difficulties"", he said that over the last week ""developments have centred around the UK"" and that recent financial turmoil was a response to the government's mini-budget.  
Mr Carney was the governor of the Bank of England for almost seven years, from July 2013 to March 2020.
Before that he led Canada's central bank for five years, where he is seen as having played a major role in helping the country avoid the worst effects of the 2008 global financial crisis.
His successor as governor, Andrew Bailey, declined to comment on Thursday on whether the Bank would make further interventions. 
Some economists - including former deputy governor Sir Charlie Bean - suggested that the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee call an emergency meeting and raise interest rates before a scheduled meeting on 3 November,  
Mr Carney said it was ""important that the system functions"" but added: ""We're talking about an interest rate meeting five weeks from now and it is important to see the persistence of the exchange rate moves, it is important to see what else the government does and take that into account.""
He added: ""This is a robust system, this is a resilient system, it has had a big knock but it will move forward.""
Bank is widely expected to raise interest rates before Mr Kwarteng announces his fiscal plan in late November. 
uld set out how the government intends to follow its own fiscal rules. The current fiscal rules state that debt should be falling as a share of the UK's gross domestic product - which is all the goods and services that the country produces - by 2024-25.
rules also dictate that by that same financial year, daily public spending should be balanced by revenues.
But it is possible that Mr Kwarteng could set out his own rules in November, changing those drawn up by his predecessor Rishi Sunak in November 2021. "	/news/business-63070485
technology	Elon Musk claims he's buying Twitter to 'help humanity'	"Elon Musk claims that he is buying Twitter to ""help humanity"" as the billionaire set out his aims for taking over the social media platform.  
In a tweet, Mr Musk said he didn't buy the firm ""to make more money. I did it to try to help humanity, whom I love"".
repreneur has until Friday to complete a $44bn (Â£38bn) takeover of Twitter or risk going to trial.
weet addressed to Twitter's advertisers states that he has ""acquired"" the firm.  
However, there has been no official confirmation that the deal has been completed. 
Earlier this week, Mr Musk published a video of himself walking into Twitter's headquarters carrying a sink, raising speculation about his aims for the firm. 
""Entering Twitter HQ - let that sink in!"" Mr Musk wrote.
In business parlance, ""kitchen sinking"" means taking radical action at a company, though it is not clear if this was Mr Musk's message - he also updated his Twitter bio to read ""chief twit"".
In his latest tweet, Mr Musk set out some of his goals for the company, saying that Twitter must be ""warm and welcoming for all"".
He wrote that he wanted ""civilization to have a common digital town square"" but he denies the platform will take an anything-goes approach. 
""Twitter cannot become a free-for-all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences!"" He also said the platform must adhere to the laws of the land.
Mr Musk has said the social media site needs significant changes. 
It was not clear whether Mr Musk met Twitter executives Wednesday when he made his trip with the sink but he listed his location as the Twitter headquarters in San Francisco on the social media platform.
When Mr Musk first revealed plans to buy Twitter, he said he wanted to clean up spam accounts on the platform and preserve it as a venue for free speech.
But Mr Musk, the world's richest man and a prolific Twitter user known for his impulsive style, baulked at the purchase just a few weeks later, citing concerns that the number of fake accounts on the platform was higher than Twitter claimed.
witter executives denied the accusations, arguing that Mr Musk wanted out because he was worried about the price.
mpany eventually filed a lawsuit to hold him to the deal, and Mr Musk revived his takeover plans on the condition that legal proceedings were paused.
must be completed by 28 October, or he will face trial over the contract.
""I'm excited about the Twitter situation,"" Mr Musk recently said during a call to discuss Tesla's financial results. Mr Musk is electric car maker's chief executive.
""I think it's an asset that has just sort of languished for a long time but has incredible potential, although obviously myself and the other investors are overpaying for Twitter right now,"" he added.
Given the history of this deal, you can see why people are hesitant about announcing it prematurely.
Elon Musk we're talking about, an erratic and capricious character.
However, everything we have seen today here in San Francisco would suggest that he will own Twitter in the coming days.
It is hard to believe he would be meeting staff if the deal wasn't as good as done.
He laughed and smiled as he entered Twitter, but he has a lot of work to do to warm up the social media platform's employees.
Reports he would dramatically reduce headcount have not gone down well with staff.
k of allowing Donald Trump and other banned accounts back onto the platform has also frustrated many employees.
It has been widely reported he is due to speak to Twitter workers on Friday, about what lies in store.
Perhaps then we'll finally get more information about ""X"", the app for everything that Mr Musk wants Twitter to become."	/news/business-63408384
politics	MSPs propose more than 150 changes to gender bill	"More than 150 changes have been proposed to the new bill that would make it easier to legally change gender in Scotland. 
MSPs had until midday on Wednesday to submit amendments to the Gender Recognition Reform bill. 
gislation has already been approved in principle despite the biggest rebellion by SNP members since the party took power. 
roposed changes will now go before Holyrood's equalities committee.
It is expected to vote on them over the next two weeks.
Scottish government has argued that the current process for changing gender is too difficult and invasive.
w bill would remove the requirement for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria or medical reports.
It would also reduce the period in which applicants need to have lived in their acquired gender to three months.
One of the most controversial proposals is to lower the minimum age that someone can apply from 18 to 16.
Anyone wanting to change their legal gender will still need to swear an oath about remaining this way for life - with it being a criminal offence to make a false declaration or application - and there would be a three-month ""reflection period"" before a certificate was issued.
Most Conservatives are opposed to the legislation but Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat MSPs backed the reform bill at stage one. 
It was also supported by most SNP members but Ash Regan resigned as a minister and was one of seven SNP members to vote against. A further two abstained.
ggest rebellion by SNP MSPs since the party took power in 2007. 
Scottish government's Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison has responded by proposing new powers to block fraudulent applications and those from people who appear to lack sufficient understanding. 
Others proposing amendments include SNP backbencher Christine Grahame who wants 16 and 17-year-old applicants to be required to live in their acquired gender for six months, rather than three. 
She also wants under-18s to demonstrate that they have sought appropriate advice. 
It is thought the Scottish government is sympathetic to Ms Grahame's proposals and has been in discussion with MSPs from across parties about other changes. 
Greens' Maggie Chapman wants to get rid of all time-related conditions, whereas Conservative amendments seek to retain the current two-year qualification period. 
ry MSPs also want to keep the requirement for a medical diagnosis and for any applicant to be at least 18 years old. 
Labour MSPs want the law to make clear that it does not water down existing rights under the UK Equalities Act. 
Labour MSP Michael Marra is also proposing that applications should be countersigned by a professional person.

politics	Rishi Sunak urges allies to boost Ukraine support	"Rishi Sunak has urged European allies to maintain or boost military support for Ukraine over the coming year.
PM kicked off a trip to the Baltic region by announcing the UK would send hundreds of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition to Ukraine. 
He also said there could not be peace talks until Russia withdrew its troops.
Last week, the BBC reported that the prime minister had asked for an assessment of the progress of the war in Ukraine. 
A Whitehall source told BBC's Newsnight programme: ""Wars aren't won [by dashboards]. Wars are won on instinct. At the start of this it was Boris (Johnson) sitting down and saying: 'Let's just go for this.' So Rishi needs to channel his inner Boris on foreign policy though not of course on anything else.""
Downing Street has insisted Mr Sunak is strongly supportive of Ukraine.
During his trip to eastern Europe, the prime minister also met British troops serving in the Nato military alliance. 
He served mince pieces to soldiers in Estonia and praised their ""selfless dedication and bravery"".
Over the past year, the UK has doubled its presence in the country in response to the build up of Russian troops in Ukraine.
Earlier in the day, Mr Sunak had attended a meeting of the leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Forces (JEF) - a coalition of northern European countries, including Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Latvia.
Addressing the gathering in the Latvian capital Riga, Mr Sunak said it was an ""incredibly important"" time for them to reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine. 
""We must be clear that any unilateral call for a ceasefire by Russia is completely meaningless in the current context.
""I think it would be a false call, it would be used by Russia to regroup, to reinforce their troops and until they have withdrawn from conquered territory, there can and should be no real negotiation.
""But what we can do is think about that time now, think about what we will do with regard to security assurances.""
He added that the group should concentrate on ""degrading Russia's capability to regroup and resupply"".
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky also addressed the meeting, albeit over video link rather than in person. 
He said providing Ukraine with a ""100% air shield"" would be ""one of the most successful steps"" countries could take against Russia. 
He added that Russian missiles had left millions in his country without heat or power. 
Following the summit, Mr Sunak met his Latvian counterpart Krisjanis Karins for talks, during which the pair agreed to work to accelerate trade between their countries. 
Mr Karins tweeted: ""As close and likeminded allies our countries have a shared commitment to regional security and a strong stance in support of Ukraine. Glad we also got to discuss strengthening of economic & high-tech links.""
Mr Sunak then headed to Estonia where he signed a technology partnership with the country's Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas, aimed at improving cooperation on cyber security, connectivity and data."	/news/uk-politics-64027987

Greg Pilley, founder of the Stroud Brewery & Taproom in Gloucestershire, said his business is facing a 10% rise in costs.
means a price increase of ""between 25 and 30 to 40p per pint"".
Other businesses in the county say they are having to reluctantly pass on rising costs to their customers in the form of higher prices.
UK is seeing its highest inflation in 41 years, with energy bills and the cost of food and drink the main drivers.
Milk prices were one of the biggest risers in latest food inflation figures, but producers say this does not always benefit them.
Richard Cornock, a Gloucestershire dairy farmer, said the price he gets for milk is determined by his major buyer. 
At the same time, he says he is having to absorb higher diesel and fertiliser prices.
""I can't go to [my milk buyer] and say I need another 5p a litre because they'll just go, ""well, we haven't budgeted for that"","" he said.
Neville Morse, who owns Jane's Pantry cafÃ© in Gloucester, said they have had to put prices up twice this year - instead of just once in April, like they usually would.
""Our energy costs have doubled in this one shop alone, from Â£4,500 a month to Â£9,000,"" said Mr Morse.
""Across our 11 shops and the factory, we have to find an extra Â£400,000 in total this year. We don't want to raise prices for our customers but we have no choice.""
One item on the bakery shelf illustrates that rise in food prices: last year, the rum truffle was Â£1.80, now it costs Â£2.20.

entertainment	Taylor Swift: Midnights praised by critics despite lack of radio hits	"r Swift's new album has been met with rave reviews from critics, although some said its subdued tone means it lacks potential hit singles.
Midnights, the singer's 10th original studio album, was awarded five stars by both the Guardian and the Independent.
Guardian said Midnights is a ""cool, collected and mature"" record which is ""packed with fantastic songs"".
But some criticised the lack of radio hits, with the Evening Standard noting there is ""not a smash hit in sight"".
Swift is currently re-recording her early records due to a dispute with music mogul Scooter Braun, but has paused that process to release a new album of original material. 
Midnights is the 32-year-old's first original album in two years and sees her return to a more mainstream sound than the somewhat muted, acoustic tone of her previous two albums.
Her new record retains some of the folksy charm of sister albums Folklore and Evermore, both released in 2020 during the pandemic. But it also sees her re-engage her pop sensibilities, with lyrics that explore more personal subject matters.
Some songs offer fans further insight into the star's normally low-key relationship with her boyfriend, English actor Joe Alwyn.
Swift previously described the album as ""stories of 13 sleepless nights, scattered throughout my life"". 
In a five-star review, the Guardian's Alexis Petridis said Midnights ""delivers her firmly from what she called the 'folklorian woods' of her last two albums back to electronic pop"". 
""There are filtered synth tones, swoops of dubstep-influenced bass, trap and house-inspired beats and effects that warp her voice to a point of androgyny,"" he noted. 
""Confidence is the thing that binds Midnights together. There's a sure-footedness about Swift's songwriting, filled with subtle, brilliant touches.""
Independent's Helen Brown also awarded five stars, writing: ""Over a series of murky electronic grooves (mostly co-written with Jack Antonoff), the pop star unpacks her darkest dreams, deepest doubts and cruellest thoughts. All the while she keeps things just cryptic enough to keep the tension crackling and the speculation buzzing.
""The subtle melodies of Midnights take time to sink their claws in,"" she added. ""But Swift's feline vocal stealth and assured lyrical control ensure she keeps your attention. Turn the lights off and let these songs prowl around you. Just don't expect their meanings to settle too biddably into your lap. Swift's always as elusive as she is allusive.""
However, the Evening Standard's David Smyth was significantly less enthusiastic, awarding the album just two stars.
""It's hard to spot anything that sounds like a smash hit on Swift's third muted collection in a row,"" he wrote.
""While the style is a change from Folklore and Evermore, Swift is never at the ball when the clock strikes 12. On the twinkly Bejeweled she announces that she's 'going out tonight', but the beats remain sleepy and sluggish.
""The brighter Karma, presumably another dig at Braun, is the only song that feels like it could be a highlight when she eventually returns to the stage. Otherwise Midnights sounds ready for bed.""
But Rolling Stone's Brittany Spanos argued that a subtle return to form has resulted in an improved quality of songwriting from the star.
""As Swift has returned to her archive for to undertake the project of re-recording her previous albums, it's clear slipping back into her past self has unlocked something brilliant and fresh in her songwriting,"" she wrote. 
""Midnights may come as a surprise to the most newly turned fans of her music, those who only learned to like her songwriting when it came in the traditionally respectable Folklore/Evermore package.""
Swift is gearing up for a busy few months. She is hoping to be nominated for an Oscar in January, either for her short film All Too Well, or in the best original song category for her track Carolina, taken from Where The Crawdads Sing 
But Midnights will be her main focus for the next few months, with fans anticipating the announcement of a world tour in support of its release.
In a four-star review, the Times' Will Hodgkinson wrote: ""Swift has said she intended Midnights as a concept piece based on 13 nights of troubled sleep, and these variously minimal, eerie, heartfelt and intense songs do have a crepuscular quality that is out of keeping with her usual cheery brightness. 
""Sometimes, as on Labyrinth, the modish vocal treatments are off-putting, but in the main Midnights appeals because, for all its modern touches, it is essentially an old-fashioned singer-songwriter album about human weakness.""
NME's Hannah Mylrea wrote: ""After a foray into a different sonic world, on Swift's return to pure pop she still shimmers.
""She spins these new stories through sleek synth-pop, in common with [previous albums] 1989 or Lover, but the razor-sharp production of these albums is more subtle this time around.""
graph's Neil McCormick praised the album's ""sensuous electro-digital sound"" in his four-star review for the Telegraph, but also highlighted the lack of radio hits. 
""Yet despite the Prince-like falsetto funkiness of opening love song Lavender Haze and glib strut of Bejeweled (""When I walk in a room, I can still make the whole place shimmer"") there are no obvious chart-smashing bangers. 
""It is almost as if she has become too mature for the brand of meme-friendly, earworm pop with which she made her name."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63341633
health	Disgraced surgeon's patients consider legal action	"Patients of a disgraced former neurosurgeon are considering a class action against NHS Tayside.
ft in chronic pain after operations by Prof Sam Eljamel at Dundee's Ninewells Hospital
A damning Scottish government report last month accused NHS Tayside of letting patients down.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said he expected NHS Tayside to give the issue the highest priority - a police investigation is also ongoing.
Dozens of patients are also calling for an external and independent review of what happened to them.
ged a protest to highlight their cause outside Ninewells Hospital. 
Scottish government has turned down calls for a public inquiry.
Prof Eljamel, the former head of neurosurgery at NHS Tayside in Dundee, harmed dozens of patients before he was suspended in 2013.
He was allowed to voluntarily remove himself from the General Medical Council's register and is now working as a surgeon in Libya.
Elizabeth Rose from L&M MediLaw said she had been approached by some of Eljamel's patients to look into any harm they experienced under his care, as well as the actions or omissions of Tayside Health Board. 
wyer also backed the patients' calls for a public inquiry.
She said: ""Although our investigations are at very early stages, a public inquiry would allow those affected to understand what happened to them and why.""
Jules Rose was among those protesting outside Ninewells Hospital.
After her operation in 2013, Ms Rose discovered that Prof Eljamel had removed her tear gland instead of a tumour on her brain.
She still has not been told exactly when health bosses knew he was a risk to patients.
Ms Rose said that a class action, or group proceeding as it is known in Scotland, was being considered.
However, she said that a public inquiry was the patients' priority.
She said: ""Patients have been complaining to NHS Tayside for years and they have got nowhere.
""They have got every door closed in their face. 
""Why was Tayside allowing the surgeon to continue butchering people for so many years, what were they doing?
""Where were their systems and processes?
""All these questions need answered by external scrutiny.""
An NHS Tayside spokeswoman said the health board was aware of the protest.
She added: ""We continue to be in contact directly with Ms Rose and have offered her another meeting with the Chair, Chief Executive and Medical Director. 
""Ms Rose has advised that she welcomes this further opportunity for discussion.  
""We are also making arrangements for other patients who wish to discuss their circumstances to be invited to a meeting."" "	/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-63877241

One doctor from Brighton, who has worked in A&E for 22 years, said he has seen ""nothing like this"".
Medway Maritime Hospital and the South East Coast Ambulance Service both declared critical incidents this month.
A Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust spokesperson said it faced challenges in discharging patients who were well enough to leave hospital, to create capacity for patients coming in.
rust took the decision to declare a critical incident in order to be able to take additional steps to maintain safe services for patients and cope with the growing pressures.

health	West Suffolk Hospital's plans for replacement are approved	"Plans for a new, larger hospital to replace one deemed ""past its use-by date"" have been given the go-ahead.
West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (WSFT) wants to build a new hospital to replace the current one in Bury St Edmunds which was built in the 1970s.
West Suffolk Council's development control committee was split over the proposal which it heard would result in the loss of ""irreplaceable habitat"".
But, councillors decided, the need for a new hospital outweighed concerns.
West Suffolk Council's approval allows WSFT to submit a business plan as part as an application for funding from central government, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.
mmittee heard the current building had structural defects associated with reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) used in its roof and walls.
It was expected the current building would not last far beyond 2030 and government funding was gained to replace it under the New Hospitals Programme - with a commitment to have it built by 2030.
Under the plans, the new hospital would be located on the Hardwick Manor site, owned by WSFT, on Hardwick Lane.
Most of the Hardwick Manor site is wood pasture parkland and, according to the officers' report, the development was expected to result in the loss of 11.5 hectares of waxcap grassland, which is classified as irreplaceable habitat.
Independent councillor Jason Crooks said: ""This is a real shame. The applicant has chosen to destroy parkland that's hundreds of years old and it is completely irreplaceable when we all know there are better alternatives.
""It is so frustrating. I don't think I can vote for this because of the destruction of the parkland,"" he said.
Concerns were also raised about emergency access to the site.
But Conservative councillor Andrew Drummond, who had the deciding vote as chairman, said: ""The care you get at West Suffolk Hospital is fantastic. But the building is past its use-by date and that will inevitably affect services.""
A full planning application to change the use of Hardwick Manor from residential to health-related was also approved.

entertainment	Fi Glover and Jane Garvey to leave BBC for Times Radio	"Broadcasters Fi Glover and Jane Garvey are leaving the BBC to host a new programme and podcast for Times Radio.
r have jointly presented the popular Fortunately podcast for the corporation since 2017.
Fortunately will continue on the BBC until the end of the year, but the pair will launch a new podcast plus a live weekday afternoon show on Times Radio.
Garvey said she was ""delighted"" to be joining the station after ""a brilliant time working for the BBC"".
uo are the latest in a lengthy line of BBC stars jumping to the commercial sector, following the likes of Vanessa Feltz, Simon Mayo, Emily Maitlis and Andrew Marr.
Garvey and Glover will co-present a programme from 1500-1700, Monday to Thursday, covering the day's news as well as their reflections on the day.  
w will launch on 10 October. Times Radio added that details of their new podcast would be announced in due course.
In a statement, Garvey said: ""I've had a brilliant time working for the BBC. Now I'm delighted to be joining the award-winning team at Times Radio. We can't wait to get started on a live mix of illuminating conversation, topical interviews and occasional carping.""
Glover added: ""It's been an amazing 29 years with the BBC. But I am so looking forward to bringing Times Radio listeners some extraordinary stories from some extraordinary people with Jane.""
Nearly 250 episodes of Fortunately with Fi and Jane have been released since the weekly podcast launched. 
Intended as a look behind the scenes of broadcasting, the format sees the pair interview a variety of guests and discuss topics sent in by listeners. 
It was the third most downloaded podcast on BBC Sounds in 2021, behind Newscast and You're Dead to Me.
Garvey and Glover's chemistry and self-deprecating humour have been applauded by listeners, and the pair have been praised for their open discussions of sometimes taboo subjects.
Garvey has had a long career with the BBC and was the first voice heard on Radio 5 Live when the station launched in 1994.
She later presented Radio 4's Woman's Hour for 13 years, alternating with Dame Jenni Murray, until both departed in 2020.
Glover started her BBC career in local radio and also went on to present a variety of programmes on 5 Live. She also fronted several shows for Radio 4, including The Listening Project and Two Rooms.
Speaking to the Times as the newspaper announced its sister radio station's latest recruits, Glover said: ""We're not leaving Fortunately in a massive strop, but we have talked about ourselves as much as we want to, and we found the offer of a return to solid journalism appealing.
""I listen to way more stuff outside the BBC than I ever thought would be possible to find, so [Times Radio] feels like a familiar world to my ears, if not to my head.""
Garvey said the BBC was currently losing ""more experienced"" staff. ""There's never been a time where people haven't been gloomy about the BBC, though,"" she said.
""I've moaned and groaned about my employer for 34 years, but I've also had some astonishing opportunities."" "	/news/entertainment-arts-62631499
business	UK house prices forecast to fall for the next two years	"UK house prices will fall for the next two years before starting to rise again, according to the government's official forecaster.
A drop of 9% is expected between now and autumn 2024, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has said.
will be a relief to some potential first-time buyers following a period of sharp rises in property prices.
But a squeeze on their own finances will limit their ability to save for a deposit.
f a mortgage is also likely to stay much higher than homeowners have become accustomed to during the last decade. A typical two- or five-year fixed-rate deal currently has an interest rate of just over 6%.
Higher mortgage rates and the wider impact of a slowdown in the economy, such as rising unemployment, will unite to push down house prices, the OBR said.
It forecast that there will still be an average increase in property prices this year of 10.7% despite the recent slowdown.
will be followed by two years of falls, with house prices down by 1.2% next year, and 5.7% in 2024.
OBR suggests that property prices will start to rise again at a rate slightly faster than people's incomes - up by 1.2% in 2025, 3% in 2026 and 3.5% in 2027.
However, it pointed out there was ""significant uncertainty over this forecast"" given the sensitivity of house prices to mortgage rates and general borrowing costs.
UK housing market, in reality, is a series of local markets, so house price falls could have more impact in some areas than others. 
For example, despite the rebound after the 2008 financial crisis, house prices in the north-east of England only returned to their pre-crash levels at the end of 2020. Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland, house prices still remain below their pre-crisis peak.
Squeezed incomes mean that first-time buyers may still be asking for the help of parents and grandparents to get enough for a deposit, even if house prices fall.
Richard Fearon, chief executive of Leeds Building Society, said: ""Our research shows that 81% of aspiring first-time buyers say that the cost of living crisis has made it harder for them to save for a deposit and almost half of them now doubt they will ever get onto the housing ladder.""
He said a lack of homes was still the key long-term issue in the market.
A new deadline will see a reversal of the cuts in stamp duty at the end of March 2025. This may also affect potential buyers' long-term plans in London and the south-east of England, where the vast majority of stamp duty is paid.
Other measures announced in the Autumn Statement could have a notable impact for other parts of the housing sector.
renting social housing in England will still face higher rental bills - but not as high as might have been the case.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the government would cap the increase in social rents in England at a maximum of 7% in 2023-24, rather than the 11% potential rise under previous rules. This cap does not apply to shared ownership rents or private sector rents.
Meanwhile, buy-to-let landlords - who may include so-called accidental landlords who find themselves with two homes after moving in together - face a higher capital gains tax bill if they sell up.
ual allowance before capital gains tax is paid will be reduced from Â£12,300 to Â£6,000 in April and then to Â£3,000 a year later. The tax is paid when you sell an asset, such as company shares, a second home, or a buy-to-let property."	/news/business-63676119

politics	Stephen Flynn: Who is the new SNP Westminster leader?	"Aberdeen South MP Stephen Flynn is set to face his first Prime Minister's Questions less than 24 hours after being elected the SNP's new Westminster leader.
Here is what we know about the 34-year-old and what colleagues expect of him.
Mr Flynn was born in Dundee and raised in the city and in nearby Brechin.
He studied politics at Dundee University before moving to Aberdeen - although he still travels back down the A90 to support Dundee United.
His hip gave way when he was a teenager, and he spent 17 years in ""constant pain"" and facing a ""daily physical and mental battle"" until eventually having replacement surgery in September 2020.
After marrying his wife in 2014, he was elected to Aberdeen City Council in a by-election the following year, and served as the SNP's group leader from 2016 until he became an MP in 2019.
He took Aberdeen South from the Conservatives - a seat which has bounced between Labour, the SNP and Tories at the last four elections.
Following his election as Westminster leader, Nicola Sturgeon congratulated both Flynn and Paisley and Renfrewshire South MP Mhairi Black, who was elected deputy leader, calling them a ""truly formidable team"".
SNP MP Stewart Hosie echoed that sentiment, telling the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""One thing you will see from Stephen is a different tone - perhaps more pointed, snappier, more vibrant. 
""I think he will bring a great deal to the table and a great deal to the independence cause as he holds the government to account.
""Stephen has rare gift of being able to communicate difficult things in a really effective way and I'm looking forward to seeing him deploy that particularly in PMQs today.""
Stephen Flynn says he will push the impact of the cost of living and Scotland's right to choose its future
Mr Flynn's maiden speech in the Commons underlines why colleagues hope he will be a punchy presence as leader.
He warned Conservative members that ""we will not forget, and we will not forgive this government"".
He added: ""Scotland rejects your austerity and Scotland rejects your Brexit, just as Scotland rejected your prime minister.""
Mr Flynn became a prominent member of the so-called Tuesday Club of male SNP MPs who regularly meet for five-a-side football, beer and curry nights.
gas industry is at the heart of his patch, and he initially argued against the idea of a windfall tax on the profits of big energy firms - something later embraced enthusiastically by the SNP.
In February, he told MPs: ""The last time the UK government implemented a windfall tax, investment in the North Sea oil and gas sector plummeted. 
""It fell off a cliff - in fact it has never got back to where it was. If that happens again, my constituents will lose their jobs.""
Mr Flynn has been linked to the leadership role for some time, with newspaper reports claiming he was set to oust Ian Blackford surfacing weeks before the Skye MP decided not to stand again.
However, SNP leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that the change is ""not a coup"". "	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63886702
politics	Earl of Shrewsbury faces suspension from Lords over lobbying claims	"A hereditary peer is facing suspension from the House of Lords for breaking lobbying rules. 
Earl of Shrewsbury was found by the Lords Conduct Committee to have approached ministers on behalf of a company marketing Covid-19 sanitiser products, which he worked for. 
mmittee recommended he should be suspended for nine months, which is subject to a vote by the upper house.
Lord Shrewsbury has said he did not realise his actions broke the rules.
Earl of Shrewsbury is one of the few remaining hereditary peers in the Lords and was affiliated with the Conservatives until October but now sits as a non-party crossbench peer.
He was paid Â£57,000 by healthcare company SpectrumX for his work as a consultant over a period of 19 months between 2020 and 2022. 
In 2020, at the height of the Covid pandemic, the firm was seeking regulatory approval for products including hand sanitisers and a walk-in disinfectant tunnel.
r approached ministers, including then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock to promote the company's tunnel in return for a Â£3,000 monthly retainer, the committee's report found. 
He referred himself to the commissioner following allegations about his conduct in relation to the company in the Sunday Times. 
Lord Shrewsbury has argued his work for SpectrumX was ""openly commercial dealing"", that he declared his interest as an adviser to the company and never sought to ""influence policy"". 
mmittee accepted that he did not act with ""deliberate dishonesty"" and did not realise his actions broke the rules. 
However, it found ""clear"" breaches of the Lords' code of conduct by seeking ""to profit from membership of the House"" and providing parliamentary advice or exercising parliamentary influence in return for payment. 
Separately, Baroness Goudie was also found to have breached the code ""by agreeing to provide parliamentary advice in return for payment"" and for breaking rules on the use of the House's facilities. 
mmittee has recommended she is suspended from the Lords for six months and Labour has also suspended her from the parliamentary party. 
reaches relate to her work for ecoLegacy in 2016 and 2017.
She was paid â¬20,000 (Â£17,454) over a 10-month period as an adviser for the company. the Lords committee said in its report. 
As part of her role, she advised the company on who to approach about their work and offered to book a room on the estate to hold meetings, although ultimately no room was reserved and Baroness Goudie did not directly approach parliamentarians on the company's behalf. 
She also commissioned research by the Lords Library on behalf of the company, in breach of the code. 
r has acknowledged she had an interest in the company during the period and has apologised for failing to register that interest until April 2017. 
However, the committee said she refused to accept her conduct had breached any other aspect of the code. 
In response to the report, Baroness Goudie said: ""Six-and-a-half years after the alleged events, I was accused by a former colleague of 'paid advocacy' and a late declaration of my interests.
""I totally refute the first allegation on which the commissioner made no finding and sincerely apologise for my late declaration in 2016, before which time I had used the Lords Library on one occasion to check facts relevant to my interests.""
upper chamber is due to vote on whether to approve the recommendations next month. "	/news/uk-politics-63998059
sports	World Aquatics Championships: US artistic swimmer Anita Alvarez rescued by coach after fainting in pool	"American artistic swimmer Anita Alvarez was rescued from the bottom of the pool by her coach after fainting at the World Aquatics Championships.
25-year-old was not breathing and had sunk after completing her routine in the solo free final in Budapest.
Her coach, Andrea Fuentes, pulled Alvarez to the surface before she was taken away on a stretcher.
US swim team later released a statement from Fuentes saying Alvarez ""feels good now"".
Alvarez previously fainted following a routine during an Olympic qualifier in Barcelona last year, with Fuentes also rescuing her on that occasion. 
Of the more recent incident, Fuentes said: ""Anita is OK - the doctors checked all vitals and everything is normal - [her] heart rate, oxygen, sugar levels, blood pressure etc. All is OK. 
""We sometimes forget that this happens in other high-endurance sports [such as] marathon, cycling, cross country. We all have seen images where some athletes don't make it to the finish line and others help them to get there. 
""Our sport is no different than others, just in a pool, we push through limits and sometimes we find them.
""Anita feels good now and the doctors also say she is OK. Tomorrow she will rest all day and will decide with the doctor if she can swim free team finals or not.""
Spanish newspaper Marca reported four-time Olympic medallist Fuentes as saying she had jumped in ""because the lifeguards weren't doing it"".
And speaking to Spanish radio, she said: ""It felt like a whole hour. I said things weren't right, I was shouting at the lifeguards to get into the water, but they didn't catch what I said or they didn't understand.
""She wasn't breathing. I went as quickly as I could, as if it were an Olympic final.""
Alvarez scored 87.6333 points for her routine, finishing seventh in the final."	/sport/swimming/61906249
