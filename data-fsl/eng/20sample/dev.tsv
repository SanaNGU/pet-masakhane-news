politics	Teachers' strike in Scotland to go ahead as new pay offer rejected	"Scotland's biggest union of teachers will take industrial action on Thursday after a new pay offer was dismissed as ""insulting"".
Employer Cosla made the fresh proposal which will see rises of up to 6.85%.
It was an improvement on the previous offer of 5% but still well below the 10% the unions want. 
rike by members of the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) will lead to the closure of most schools in Scotland. 
Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville believed the offer was fair and recognised that the ""cost of living crisis is the priority"".
Under this latest proposal teachers earning less than £40,107 would receive an extra £1,926 a year - equivalent to a 6.86% uplift for the lowest paid.
wo bands were being offered a 5% uplift, with those on £60,000 or more receiving no more than £3,000.
Ahead of the new offer being made, the education secretary told the Scottish Parliament that the 10% demand by teacher representatives was ""unaffordable"" for the Scottish government.
EIS said its salaries committee unanimously rejected the offer in a special online meeting on Tuesday. 
Its general secretary Andrea Bradley said it was a ""divisive offer...which is actually worse for many teachers in promoted posts"".
""Our members will see this offer for exactly what it is - a kick in the teeth from their employers and the Scottish government,"" she added. 
""This afternoon's salaries committee expressed outrage at this offer, and that outrage is sure to be replicated in staffrooms across Scotland today and tomorrow. 
""Our programme of strike action, which will commence as scheduled on Thursday, will clearly show the strength of feeling of Scotland's teachers who will be out in numbers and with strong voice on picket lines and at regional rallies.""
A spokesman for the Scottish Secondary Teachers Association (SSTA), which is planning a strike on 7 and 8 December, described it as a ""very disappointing offer"". 
""The unions have been led down the garden path by Cosla and the Scottish government and tell us they care about teachers and value their commitment over the last few years,"" the spokesman said.
""This offer will not go down well with teachers and I would expect the planned strikes to go ahead. Maybe they will listen to parents and children as they are not listening to teachers.""
Meanwhile a third teachers' union - the NASUWT - says its members have voted for strike action, which will take place on 7 and 8 December. 
will take action short of strike action from 9 December, refusing to cover for absent colleagues and attending no more than one meeting per week outside pupil sessions. 
Mike Corbett, the union's national official Scotland, said: ""Our members are angry, demoralised and have had enough. 
""They are sick of being expected to put up with declining wages while working ever harder to meet the increasing challenges being faced in our schools. They are facing increasing financial hardship with more teachers having to cut back on basic necessities.""
Cosla, the umbrella body for Scotland's 32 councils, had called on the EIS to postpone Thursday's strike.
Spokeswoman Katie Hagmann said: ""We have worked extremely hard and closely with Scottish government to ensure such a revised offer could be brought forward and made today. 
""I would call on our trade union colleagues to recognise that these are extremely challenging financial times we are operating in and we all need to make decisions with a full understanding of the consequences.
She added that it was is ""in line with offers made to all other parts of the public sector"".
Meanwhile the Scottish Conservatives were highly critical of the education secretary's role in the negotiations with teaching unions. 
""It should never have reached the stage where the SNP Government were scrambling around at the eleventh hour trying to strike a deal with teachers, and it's no surprise that this last-gasp offer has been rejected,"" Stephen Kerr, the party's education spokesman said. 
""Shirley-Anne Somerville has been missing in action as strikes have loomed large for months...The whole saga has shown that Shirley-Anne Somerville lacks the leadership required to resolve disputes satisfactorily."""	/news/uk-scotland-63715723

business	People cut back on food, fuel and clothes as prices rise, BBC survey suggests	"People struggling with the soaring cost of living are cutting back on food and car journeys to save money, according to a BBC-commissioned survey.
More than half (56%) the 4,011 people asked had bought fewer groceries, and the same proportion had skipped meals.
findings reveal the widespread impact of prices rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. 
Many people have cut spending on clothes and socialising. Some say their mental health has been affected.
wo-thirds of those surveyed also suggested government support provided so far was insufficient.
BBC-commissioned survey of 4,011 UK adults in early June lifts a lid on how the economic climate is affecting lives and financial, physical and mental health.
f domestic energy, petrol, and food have all increased significantly in recent months, and the findings suggest more than eight in 10 people (81%) are worried about the rising cost of living.
Concern has grown since the start of the year when 69% of those asked said they were worried in a similar BBC survey.
In the latest results, two thirds (66%) of those with worries said this was having a negative effect on their mental health. Nearly half (45%) said their physical health had been affected.
Day-to-day, individuals are making further changes to manage their budgets. The survey suggests this can be as simple as going on fewer nights out, or getting a haircut less often.
For charity worker Janine Colwill, from Easington, and those she talks to, the changes have been more fundamental.
""We get together with the family every Sunday, religiously, for Sunday roast - but my family and other families are starting to grow their own vegetables,"" she said.
""Those people who may not have worried about these things before are now worrying about them constantly.
""With advances in technology, I never would have thought that people would be relying on a food bank or growing their own - and just penny-pinching,"" she said.
urvey suggests people are finding various ways to manage and save their money. The findings include: 
About half (52%) expect to work more hours in the next six months to help to pay the bills.
, the UK's largest supermarket, said in a trading update for the three months to 28 May that it was seeing early signs that shoppers are changing their habits due to inflation, such as buying less food and visiting more frequently. 
Chief executive Ken Murphy also said people are switching to cheaper own-label brands for goods including bread and pasta which have seen prices soar due to the war between Ukraine and Russia, both of which are major wheat exporters.  
Prices, as measured by inflation, are rising at a rate of 9% a year, the fastest for 40 years. Interest rates, which also affect the cost of living, were increased to 1.25% on Thursday by the Bank of England - the highest they have been for 13 years.
uation is being driven, to a significant degree, by global factors such as the cost of oil, gas and food. 
But there are UK-specific issues which are adding to inflation such as the tight labour market. Job vacancies are at a record high of 1.3 million meaning employers face paying higher wages to fill roles. 
Also, the UK's dominant services sector - which includes the likes of accountancy and law firms, as well as restaurants and pubs - is seeing price rises. 
Drivers now have to spend £103 for petrol and £106 for diesel to fill a family car, according to the RAC. The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD) has predicted food prices will rise at a rate of 15% this summer as households pay more for staples such as bread, meat, dairy and fruit and vegetables.
A typical household in England, Wales and Scotland is likely to see a rise in its annual domestic gas and electricity bill of £800 in October, on top of a £700 rise in April.
urge in inflation is hitting wide and hitting deep, with the effects leading to significant changes in the way lives are being lived well beyond those on low incomes. 
Large swathes of Britain's middle income working households are having to make material cutbacks and even after that are part of a new class of those ""just about managing"".  
In practice this has meant energy bill direct debits wiping out people's entire disposable income, some food banks running out of food donations, or their donors becoming users. 
And it may be changing attitudes, with nearly two-thirds of those asked saying even after the recent package of support for energy bills from the government, that it is not enough. And the numbers suggest a similar proportion think the support in place needs to last at least a year longer.
Inflation this high certainly changes the economy and our spending behaviour. 
But the figures raise a question about whether the high levels of government support in the pandemic and in this energy crisis too, are now becoming baked into public expectations.
Soaring prices have led the government to announce a package of financial support directed primarily at those on low incomes. This includes a £400 discount on all energy bills in October, in addition to payments totalling £650 to people on means-tested benefits. Pensioners will get more this winter, as will billpayers with disabilities.
However, the BBC survey reveals that 64% of those asked said this support was insufficient to help people with the rising cost of living.
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said vulnerable households would receive £1,200 which he said was part of a ""very large"" amount of support, on top of what had already been provided.
He said the first payments would come in July, and would continue into the autumn to offset the key driver of the rising cost of living for households, which was energy bills.
""That, of course, is yet to filter through to people, which is why I suspect people are saying they want more support,"" he told the BBC.
""As this gathers pace, it will be clear to people that this will be a comprehensive package.""
mpact of rising household costs has already led to the financial regulator warning lenders that they need to do more to help those in financial difficulty and support vulnerable customers.
""Early action is important for those struggling with debt,"" said Sheldon Mills, of the Financial Conduct Authority."	/news/business-61813857

Mr Price promised to ask all party staff to share their experiences and said he would learn from them.
But he declined to comment on claims he knew of allegations against a party Senedd member a year ago.
Several sources have said there is substantial unease within the party about the way allegations have been dealt with.
Welsh Parliament's Standards Commissioner is investigating serious allegations made against Rhys ab Owen, MS for South Wales central.
Mr ab Owen is suspended in the meantime. Sources have claimed the allegations were in raised in Plaid a year ago.
BBC Wales also learned earlier this week the party has also commissioned a HR firm to look into misconduct allegations in Plaid Cymru, unrelated to Rhys ab Owen.
One source spoke of an ""awful culture"" in the party and a ""lack of leadership"".
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Drive with Gareth Lewis, Mr Price said: ""I've made it very clear that Plaid Cymru, like all parties, has to work to improve its culture and ensure that it has a safe and inclusive environment for everyone.
""I'm concerned to read this and we're committed to ensuring that we do practice those values of inclusivity and creating a safe space.
""As a result of these comments, we will be reaching out to all our staff, giving them a space to share their experiences confidentially.
""And we are committed, absolutely, to taking any necessary action as a consequence of learning from them.""
Asked if he knew about the Rhys ab Owen allegations a year ago, he said: ""It's not possible for us to comment on a case which is being investigated at the moment.""

follows the death of a man at Manston, which may have been caused by diphtheria. 
Health secretary Steve Barclay said the risk to the public was ""very low"". 
During a visit to the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, Mr Barclay said a ""very high uptake"" of diphtheria vaccinations within the British public meant many people were well protected. 
He stressed that the situation was being monitored ""closely"".
Diphtheria is a highly contagious infection that affects the nose, throat and sometimes cause ulcers on the skin.
According to the NHS website, it is spread by coughs and sneezes or through close contact with someone who is infected, and in serious cases can be fatal.
It can also be spread by sharing items such as cups, cutlery, clothing or bedding with an infected person. 
UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said there had been an ""increase"" in cases of diphtheria reported among migrants arriving in the UK.
It has confirmed 50 cases were identified as of 25 November, including among children. The figure stood at 39 on November 10.
Public health experts have raised concerns about the spread of the disease as migrants were moved to hotels.
UKHSA report said 38 of the cases have been reported in south-east England, with some cases also detected across London, the West Midlands and the north-east of England.

Immigration minister Robert Jenrick said any asylum seekers who may have the infection but are already in hotels will be told to isolate in their rooms while they are treated. 
He later confirmed the isolation centres would be similar to those used to curb infections during the Covid-19 pandemic.
Mr Jenrick told the Commons: ""From today, no-one presenting with symptoms will progress into the asylum accommodation system.
""They will either remain at Manston, isolating for a short period, or they will travel to a designated isolation centre in secure transport where they will be treated until deemed medically fit.""
reatment of migrants at the processing centre in Kent has triggered a wave of campaigns and concern from health professionals and campaigners. 
At one point, the facility designed to hold 1,600 people contained 4,000. 
Charity Detention Action launched a legal campaign to remove migrants housed in the facility for longer than 24 hours.  
Home Secretary Suella Braverman said the overcrowding was caused by a lack of suitable accommodation.
She told MPs: ""What I have refused to do is to prematurely release thousands of people into local communities without having anywhere for them to stay.""
A post-mortem examination is being carried out to determine the cause of death of the man who died after being held at Manston.  A test indicated ""diphtheria may be the cause"" of his illness, government officials have said."	/news/uk-63788016

Earlier this month, the ex-bowler told MPs he had become a target of abuse since speaking out about racism.
During the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee hearing, the 31-year-old described being abused and spoke of a man ""defecating"" in his garden.

Last year, Rafiq was found to have been the victim of racial harassment and bullying while he was a player at Yorkshire County Cricket Club.
He told MPs that English cricket was ""institutionally"" racist, sparking the scandal that has dogged English cricket for much of the past two years.
His testimony led to changes in Yorkshire's leadership, Headingley being temporarily stripped of hosting international matches, and reprimands for several current and former players and coaches.
It also led to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) putting together a 12-point plan to tackle racism in the game.

business	Energy bills: 'We cut back but are paying three times as much'	"Amy Appleyard had been paying £136 a month to heat and light her home.
Knowing that energy bills would rise in the autumn, she and her family had cut back on how much power they were using.
But they were shocked to be told that their monthly direct debit would rise more than three times to £442.
re just one of many UK households who have cut back on energy but are still being charged higher direct debits. But suppliers say bills have to reflect soaring energy prices.
It comes after Business Secretary Grant Shapps wrote to energy firms asking them to ensure bills reflected the amount of energy customers were using, and not to over-estimate charges. 
Mrs Appleyard, her husband Mike and eight-year-old daughter Kathryn, faced the huge hike in direct debit energy payments despite cutting back at their three-bedroom home in Greater Manchester.
""We've all become a bit more obsessive about turning off lights or unplugging chargers,"" Mrs Appleyard said.
""We also didn't put the heating on as early as usual this year, just maybe for an hour to warm the house through.""
She said her family's ""nightmare"" started because her supplier cut their monthly direct debit without telling them, so when it made its annual review of their monthly payments it led to a much bigger increase than usual.
""After spending hours on the phone, and being guaranteed that I would pay £200 monthly, and then seeing that £442 was still taking out of my account, I just burst into tears,"" she said.
Since then there have been more conversations and Mrs Appleyard said she hoped the situation will soon be sorted.
""We just want to pay for the gas and electricity we used but it's become very difficult,"" she said.
""I've been told that only £200 will be taken out of my account in December, but the situation is ongoing and has been horribly stressful.""
Meanwhile, Rory in South Wales said his direct debits had also gone up, while his energy use had gone down, so he ended up £1,400 in credit with his supplier.
He told Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show that he had asked to reduce his direct debit to a monthly amount he could afford but his supplier refused.
He said the direct debits have been increased to £481 even though his monthly usage has been nearer £300.
""I simply want to reduce it to an amount I can afford to pay and use the surplus to top up. I don't want to have all that money sitting there and me paying a ridiculous amount to the energy provider,"" he said.
Customers who pay gas and electricity bills by direct debit have the costs evened out over the year in a process known as smoothing.
m of smoothing is to avoid sudden bill shocks by spreading the cost over the whole year so even if you use a lot more energy in a winter month, you don't get a nasty surprise.
u get should be the actual amount you're charged for your energy. It is a combination of a standing daily charge plus your metered energy usage (your unit rate per kWh). 
It will change every month, depending on how much energy you use.
Suppliers encourage direct debit payments by offering customers a discount. They then estimate what your bills will be over the year, based on the price of gas and electricity and on your previous and predicted energy use.
Suppliers should ensure your direct debit payment is fair and proportionate to your usage.
If any customer ends up overpaying, they should be able to claim the extra amount back at the end of the year and maybe reduce their direct debits.
However rising energy costs - prices have doubled since last year - have left most people facing higher direct debits.
If your direct debit payments are regularly higher than your bills, you can challenge the amount with your supplier. 
Ask them to lower your monthly payments to reflect more accurately the amount of energy you actually use, based on your meter readings.
If they refuse you can make a complaint to your supplier and if you get no satisfaction you can escalate it to the Energy Ombudsman. 
Earlier this year, an Ofgem review of how energy firms were charging customers by direct debit revealed that about 500,000 households had seen their payments double, despite prices rising by 54%.
It told UK energy suppliers to review the way they charge customers by direct debit.
Ofgem said it had already called on firms to address the issue, but would be prepared to take further action if necessary.
At the weekend Mr Shapps told energy firms: ""I am interested to understand how you intend to ensure that your direct debit system does not over-estimate charging.""

technology	Grand Theft Auto VI footage leaked after hack, developer Rockstar confirms	"More than 90 videos and images from the next edition of the Grand Theft Auto franchise have been leaked online by a hacker, the game's developers say.
ked content was posted on Sunday after what is being described as one of gaming's biggest security breaches. 
Rockstar Games said it remained unclear how the ""network intrusion"" occurred, but confirmed ""early development footage"" from GTA VI had been stolen. 
footage was put on the GTAForums site by a user called teapotuberhacker. 
ker claimed to have gained access to the data by breaching Rockstar's internal feed on the Slack messaging app, and invited executives to negotiate to avoid further leaks. 
Additional revelations could include source code, assets, and testing builds from both GTA 5 and GTA 6, which could be damaging to the company's operations. 
While the original post has since been removed by moderators, it has been spread widely on social media. Rockstar has reportedly issued takedown orders to remove the footage from YouTube and Twitter. 
footage showed animation tests, level layouts and some gameplay demonstrations, and it appeared to confirm a long-running rumour that the game will feature the series' first playable female protagonist. 
revealed the game's setting in a fictionalised version of Miami which was also the setting on 2002's GTA: Vice City. 
In a statement on Monday, the company said it was ""extremely disappointed to have any details of our next game shared with you all in this way"". 
""Our work on the next Grand Theft Auto game will continue as planned and we remain as committed as ever to delivering an experience to you, our players, that truly exceeds your expectations,"" it added. 
Rockstar confirmed it was developing the game earlier this year, with industry insiders anticipating a 2024 or 2025 release date. 
Some fans had speculated that the leak could see the game's release delayed, but executives said they did not anticipate ""any long-term effect on the development of our ongoing projects"".
GTA 5 has sold more than 170 million copies since its release in 2013, making it one of the most successful video games of all time. 
In 2020, its online mode is estimated to have generated more than $900 million (£788 million) alone.

technology	Drones to track Walsall's off-road bikers	"A council is considering buying drones to deal with nuisance off-road bikers following hundreds of complaints.
In the past 12 months West Midlands Police has received 777 reports from residents in Walsall.
Walsall Council says the technology could help police gather evidence to track offenders and seize their motorbikes.
""These are deadly machines in the wrong hands,"" said Paul Gordon, the council's director of resilient communities.
Mr Gordon added the problem with off-road bikes spanned the borough but there were ""corridors of activity where we would want to take targeted action"", according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
""We're gathering lots of data and we're starting to get the evidence together to be able to deal with this in a proactive way. The message from ourselves is 'we're coming to get you and your bikes',"" he said.
Ch Supt Phil Dolby, of Walsall police, said the West Midlands force did have use of drone technology but this was shared across the area, with demand high.
""Off-road bikes and the way they are being ridden at the moment is totally unacceptable, frustrating and very dangerous,""said Ch Supt Dolby. ""What's quite tricky for us is a tactical response that doesn't lead to injuries to the public, these people or my officers either being injured or in court.""
Police were ""coming around to"" the use of drone footage to track offenders, confiscate and crush vehicles, he added.
Walsall Council figures reveal a further 57 complaints of anti-social biking to its community protection team in the past 12 months.
Councillor Garry Perry, deputy leader for resilient communities, said he had also received more than 100 reports, largely of noise nuisance and intimidation, from residents in the Pelsall area.
""You have those who just have [bikes] for recreational use but you have another type who use those vehicles on the road without helmets and often with their faces covered,"" he said.
Walsall Council leader Mike Bird said his cabinet would look into financing a drone for the police to use solely in the borough.
""We've got to stop this. It is an invest to save,"" Mr Bird added.

sports	Jade Jones: Anxiety led to Tokyo Olympic disappointment	"Double Olympic taekwondo champion Jade Jones says she ""wasn't in a good place"" at last summer's Tokyo Games after suffering from anxiety in lockdown.
Welsh fighter had been hoping to win an historic third consecutive Olympic gold but lost her first fight.
29-year-old says she has learned the lessons and believes she can still win gold again at Paris 2024.
""I didn't realise how much lockdown affected me,"" Jones told BBC Sport Wales.
""I haven't really spoken about it because it's not the kind of thing I do. But I was struggling with a lot of anxiety in lockdown and had never really experienced that before.
""I was petrified to go near my family, thinking I was going to pass on this deadly thing - like everybody was. I was over-thinking everything. That's where it started from.
""On top of putting all that pressure on myself and being locked down as well. Then at the end of it, what normally helps is my family being there to cheer me on - whereas it was just totally different [in Tokyo].
""It was dead. It didn't even feel like an Olympics. I just struggled to get into that zone mentally and in taekwondo, one little mess up in that two minutes and you're out. Your Games are over.""
Jones, who has now set up a scholarship to help young female athletes achieve their own sporting dreams, lost her opening bout to Kimia Alizadeh of the Refugee Olympic Team.
Now, exactly nine months on from that day in Tokyo, the 2012 and 2016 champion is in good spirits.
Jones has returned to competitive action - winning gold in her first tournament since the Games, the President's Cup, in February.
Flint fighter, who was also the reigning world champion going into Tokyo, also admits that the build-up to her third Olympics was the first time in her career she had let the hype affect her.
Prior to the Games no British woman in any sport had won three consecutive Olympic golds.
She credits sports psychologists, her family, best friend and British teammate Bianca Walkden and former GB taekwondo Olympian Sarah Stevenson for helping her through the aftermath of Tokyo.
Each was there for a coffee, a chat or a laugh as Jones processed what was as much a shock as it was a disappointment.
It has left behind a renewed determination for success.
She is targeting the upcoming European Championships and Grand Prix series.
And one eye is already on qualifying for her fourth Olympic Games in Paris in 2024 - where she still believes she can win that third gold.
But it is a determination underpinned with pragmatism after her time in Tokyo.
""I've learnt so many lessons,"" she continued.
""One of those is enjoying it again and not putting too much expectation on everything. Trying to just do my very best at each competition and see where it gets me.
""I hope I will definitely enjoy the journey a lot more this last couple of years.
""My first competition back was amazing. I fought five real tough opponents. And obviously it was a dream comeback to stamp my foot on the ground to say I'm still here. Tokyo was a fluke and a one-off.
""I'm going to carry on because I still believe I can get that third medal,"" she added.
""But it's just that realisation that it's tough. I could go again and lose my first fight again. So it's about being realistic that it might not be a fairytale ending - but I'm going to give it my best.""
Paris 2024 would be the final chapter in Jones's remarkable taekwondo story. She is now thinking about the next generation.
In December she launched a scholarshipexternal-link - aiming to find and support young female athletes in Wales.
She has just selected her first two athletes - Beth Christy (taekwondo) and Anastasia Blease (wheelchair basketball). The teenagers will now receive financial support, but also advice and guidance from Jones herself.
""When you do get to the top - I'm all cushty now in the [GB Taekwondo] academy,"" she said. ""I've got my training there and don't have to think about anything. It's easy to forget where you've come from.
""They're just two amazing, inspirational girls. You can tell they're really hungry and they know what they want. I see myself in them.
""I was very lucky to have supportive parents but we didn't have money - I've come from nothing. I remember those days of going round pubs with an ashtray to try to get a little bit of money to get to the Youth Olympic qualifiers.
""You realise that so many kids out there either don't have the parent backing or don't have the money. It's just lots of wasted talent. 
""So to be able to give back and be in this position now to help somebody else just shows how special sport is. It's not always about the gold medals at the end, which are obviously nice.
""Giving back is definitely something special to me."""	/sport/wales/61222480

business	Twitter staff say layoffs have started after Elon Musk takeover	"witter staff have started to post online that they believe they have lost their jobs, ahead of an announcement by the company later on Friday.
media giant says it will inform its staff whether they are still employed after Elon Musk's takeover.
Employees are tweeting using the hashtag #LoveWhereYouWorked and a saluting emoji to say they are leaving.
Yash Agarwal, who worked in public policy, said it was ""the greatest privilege ever"" to work for Twitter.
In an internal email, the social media company said the cuts are ""an effort to place Twitter on a healthy path"".
firm added that its offices would be temporarily closed, with staff unable to enter the building until they know if they have lost their jobs.
multi-billionaire will be Twitter's chief executive after buying the firm last week in a $44bn (£39.3bn) deal.
""We will go through the difficult process of reducing our global workforce on Friday,"" Twitter said in the email.
""We recognise this will impact a number of individuals who have made valuable contributions to Twitter, but this action is unfortunately necessary to ensure the company's success moving forward,"" it added.
mpany said office access would be immediately limited ""to help ensure the safety of each employee as well as Twitter systems and customer data"".
All staff are set to receive an email with the subject ""Your Role at Twitter"" by 09:00 Pacific time (16:00 GMT) on Friday.
Workers who are not affected will be notified through their company email, according to Twitter. 
Meanwhile, those who are affected will be told of the ""next steps"" through their personal accounts.
""Given the nature of our distributed workforce and our desire to inform impacted individuals as quickly as possible, communications for this process will take place via email,"" Twitter said.
re is speculation that as many as half of Twitter's 8,000 jobs are on the chopping block.
form struggles to make a profit. One way to fix the problem is by making a dent in the wage bill.
Simon Balmain, a senior community manager for Twitter in the UK, told the BBC that he believed he has been laid off, because he was logged out of his work laptop and Slack messaging programme.
""Everyone got an email saying that there was going to be a large reduction in headcount, and then around an hour later, folks started getting their laptops remotely wiped and access to Slack and Gmail revoked,"" he said.
""Most UK folks are probably asleep and don't know yet. I was working mostly LA (Los Angeles) hours because of the projects I was on, so was still awake when it happened.""
Another Twitter worker said he was anxiously waiting for an email to arrive, confirming whether he still had a job.
He said he would probably stay up late to wait for the message.
""The exodus of talent from this lay-off will reshape the whole technology industry as we know it. We're all looking out for each other and the outreach of love and support has been incredible to see,"" Mr Balmain said. 
Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, suggested some senior staff were asked to make lists of employees to be cut on their teams. 
Cryptocurrency platform Binance invested in Twitter as part of Mr Musk's takeover. Earlier, Changpeng Zhao, its chief executive, said that ""a slimmer workforce would make more sense"".
Mr Zhao, who was speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, also criticised the platform for having been slow to roll out new features, given its level of staffing.
-cutting follows criticism of Twitter's efforts to raise money by proposing to charge $8 (£7) a month for a ""verified"" blue check-mark.
In addition to the verification badge, those who pay could have their tweets promoted more widely and see fewer adverts.
Mr Musk has tweeted of his plan: ""We need to pay the bills somehow."" 
witter has not made a profit in several years and its number of users has remained fairly static at about 300 million a month.
Many experts suggest that Mr Musk, the world's richest man, overpaid for the company, given current economic conditions and the depressed values of many tech stocks.
But Brandon Borrman, Twitter's former head of global communications, in a BBC interview, questioned how Twitter could justify asking people to pay in order to remain on an ""equal playing field"" with other users.
It is not clear how the cuts will affect the platform's operations. Mr Musk has a reputation for being ruthless when it comes to staff.
US media reports already speak of long hours spent by some staff to meet Mr Musk's demands in the aftermath of the takeover.
In May, Mr Musk said his work ethic expectations would be ""extreme"", but less than he demanded of himself.
As part of the takeover agreement, nine members of Twitter's board departed the company, leaving self-styled ""Chief Twit"" Mr Musk as the sole director.
move was seen as cementing Mr Musk's control over the company.
Among those leaving were chairman Bret Taylor and chief executive Parag Agrawal. 
Other senior figures have also posted about leaving, or are reported to have left, including chief financial officer Ned Segal.
As senior figures left, US media reported that a number of Mr Musk's allies joined Twitter.

health	Cornwall tourist died after two-hour wait for ambulance, inquest hears	"Ambulance delays in Cornwall ""significantly reduced"" the chances of a man surviving a stroke, an inquest has heard.
Reedman, 54, died four days after suffering a stroke while on holiday in Cornwall in June 2021.
quest heard he waited nearly two-and-a-half hours for an ambulance to take him from his holiday cottage to the Royal Cornwall Hospital at Truro.
mong three in the county raised with the government.
Andrew Cox, senior coroner for Cornwall, said ambulance delays in the case of Mr Reedman and two others, David Morganti and Winnie Barnes-Weeks, were either the cause or a contributing factor in their deaths. 
Mr Reedman, from Norfolk, started feeling unwell on the evening of 26 June and his wife, Jill, dialled 999.
rs suspected he was having a stroke and graded him as a priority two - meaning an ambulance should have reached him within the national target of 18 minutes.
He underwent surgery in hospital, but developed a cerebrovascular infarction and died four days later.
Guy Davies, assistant coroner for Cornwall, said the delay in the ambulance reaching Mr Reedman directly led to the delay in treatment starting at hospital, which could have saved his life.
""I find that the delay between the 999 call and Tony being taken to hospital significantly reduced his chances of surviving the blood clot,"" he told Cornwall Coroner's Court.
""The average stroke patient has a one in three chance of a positive outcome following treatment by thrombolysis in the first hour following a stroke.
""This is reduced down to one in 30 after four-and-a-half hours. Tony's stroke was more serious than the average.
""I find on the evidence it is not possible to definitively determine whether Tony would have survived if he had arrived at a hospital earlier and been treated earlier.""
In a preventing future deaths report to Health Secretary Steve Barclay, Mr Cox said hospital bed-blocking and ambulance delays were ""recurring themes"" in the cases.
He said he had been told by the medical director at the South West Ambulance Service Trust that delays were being caused by ambulances being in the ""wrong place at the wrong time"".
""When they are required for emergency responses, they are parked outside Royal Cornwall Hospital with patients in the back for extended periods,"" he wrote.
""On occasions this summer and autumn, there have been queues of over 20 ambulances outside the emergency department and delays have been longer than a paramedic's shift.""
roner said the Royal Cornwall Hospital's medical director had told him there had been at times the equivalent of five wards of patients fit for discharge, but they could not leave due to problems with the social care sector.
Mr Cox wrote about a fourth inquest into the death of Robert Conybeare, which found he died after suffering a fall in hospital at a time when he was fit to be discharged but there was no suitable social care support.
He wrote: ""My central concern is how the delays that are currently manifest can be mitigated in the intervening months, particularly given the likely increase in demand for ambulances/hospital admissions during the winter months.""
report gives the Department of Health and Social Care until 10 January to respond to the coroner's concerns.
A spokeswoman said: ""Each of these four deaths is a tragedy and our sympathies are with the families affected.
""We have received the prevention of future deaths report and will be responding to the coroner in due course.
""We have prioritised health and social care in the autumn statement, with an additional £6.6bn available over the next two years, to tackle the backlog, speed up discharge and ensure patients are getting the care they deserve quickly.""
In a joint statement Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Integrated Care Board (ICB), Cornwall Council, Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust and South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust extended their sincere condolences to the families of the patients referenced in the report.
Kate Shields, ICB CEO, said: ""The report highlights the complex pressures on all parts of our health and care system that our staff are working tirelessly to resolve.
""We have recently introduced new ways of working with the aim of reducing delays in patients' journeys from their admission through to discharge in both our acute and community services.
""These changes have resulted in some improvement in ambulance response and handover times in Cornwall but we will continue to focus our efforts until we are confident all patients get timely access to care.""

entertainment	Nandi Bushell releases debut single written to 'cheer up Dad'	"A schoolgirl who has performed with some of the world's biggest rock stars has released a new single inspired by her dad's health struggles.
Nandi Bushell, 12, of Ipswich, Suffolk, has bookended this month by drumming at the Foo Fighters' Taylor Hawkins memorial gig and launching her track. 
multi-instrumentalist has also won the attention of Barack Obama and tech giant Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
Nandi said: ""I wrote a song to cheer [my dad] up.""
mpanying video to The Shadows, released on 30 September, charts Nandi's journey from toying around with instruments in her former South African home as a toddler to playing guitars and drums with her dad, with current studio footage of her playing a grand piano.
Quick Q&A with drumming star Nandi Bushell
""The single is about how my dad went through depression... because his auto-immune disease was worsening,"" said Nandi. 
""He told me and he was really upset so I made a song about it.""
Mr Bushell said he felt Nandi's song had ""genuinely helped him"" and hoped it would have the same impact on other people.
""I was having flare-ups all over my body and I was feeling really, really terrible,"" he said.
""Nandi was asking me questions and I was describing how I felt trapped in the bed and in my room, and she said how she wanted to do something to cheer me up. I said all my rainbows felt like they were turning to black. 
""She said, 'Let me put these words into the song,' and finished it by saying, 'I'll be there for you'. I thought this is incredible, [it was] such a beautiful moment.""
r hope the track will reach a wide audience, fuelled in part by Nandi's 2.5m social media followers, a forthcoming appearance on children's TV programme Blue Peter this Monday and her meeting this week with Apple chief Mr Cook.
Her profile has been boosted following a string of extraordinary events including performing with Lenny Kravitz, appearing on US talk show Ellen and writing a song in 2021 with ex-Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello and his son Roman, which former US President Barack Obama posted on his Facebook page.
However, it is her enduring link-up with Foo Fighters that has continued to make headlines after she challenged frontman Dave Grohl to a drum battle during one of the coronavirus lockdowns. It led him to write Nandi a song and he invited her to perform with them at The Forum in Los Angeles last year.
It was there that the band's drummer Taylor Hawkins, who died aged 50 earlier this year, gave the young prodigy his drumsticks.
Poignantly, Nandi used them during her performance for Learn to Fly at his Wembley Stadium tribute gig.
""There was this balcony where I could see the gig happening - it was emotional,"" said Nandi.
She said appearing at both gigs, along with playing at the Queen's Platinum Jubilee concert where she cried after meeting her hero Stephen Fry, had been the highlights of her life so far.
But for now her sights are set on her single release and her forthcoming EP, Into The Abyss, released later this year.
""If one person who is going through a difficult time listens to that song and decides to reach out for help, then that is a measure of success,"" said Mr Bushell.

technology	Inside a US military cyber team’s defence of Ukraine	"Russia failed to take down Ukrainian computer systems with a massive cyber-attack when it invaded this year, despite many analysts' predictions. The work of a little-known arm of the US military which hunts for adversaries online may be one reason. The BBC was given exclusive access to the cyber-operators involved in these global missions.
In early December last year, a small US military team led by a young major arrived in Ukraine on a reconnaissance trip ahead of a larger deployment. But the major quickly reported that she needed to stay.  
""Within a week we had the whole team there ready to go hunting,"" one of the team recalls. 
me to detect Russians online and their Ukrainian partners made it clear they needed to start work straight away. 
""She looked at the situation and told me the team wouldn't leave,"" Maj Gen William J Hartman, who heads the US Cyber National Mission Force, told the BBC. 
""We almost immediately got the feedback that 'it's different in Ukraine right now'. We didn't redeploy the team, we reinforced the team.""
Since 2014, Ukraine has witnessed some of the world's most significant cyber-attacks, including the first in which a power station was switched off remotely in the dead of winter. 
By late last year, Western intelligence officials were watching Russian military preparations and growing increasingly concerned that a new blizzard of cyber-attacks would accompany an invasion, crippling communications, power, banking and government services, to pave the way for the seizure of power. 
US military Cyber Command wanted to discover whether Russian hackers had already infiltrated Ukrainian systems, hiding deep inside. Within two weeks, their mission became one of its largest deployments with around 40 personnel from across US armed services.
In January they had a front-row seat as Russia began paving the way in cyberspace for a coming invasion in which Ukraine's cyber-defences would be put to an unprecedented test. 
filtration of computer networks had for many years been primarily about espionage - stealing secrets - but recently has been increasingly militarised and linked to more destructive activities like sabotage or preparation for war. 
means a new role for the US military, whose teams are engaged in ""Hunt Forward"" missions, scouring the computer networks of partner countries for signs of penetration. 
""They are hunters and they know the behaviour of their 'prey',"" explains the operator who leads defensive work against Russia. 
US military asked for some operators to remain anonymous and others to be identified only by their first names due to security concerns.
Since 2018, US military operators have been deployed to 20 countries, usually close allies, in Europe, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific region. - although not countries like the UK, Germany or France, which have their own expertise and are less likely to need or want outside help. 
Most of their work has been battling state-hackers from China and North Korea but Russia has been their most persistent adversary. Some countries have seen multiple deployments, including Ukraine, where for the first time cyber attacks were combined with a full-scale war.
Inviting the US military into your country can be sensitive and even controversial domestically, so many partners ask that the US presence remains secret - the teams rarely wear uniform. But increasingly, governments are choosing to make missions public.
In May, Lithuania confirmed a three-month deployment had just finished working on its defence and foreign affairs networks, prioritised because of concerns over threats from Russia in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. 
Croatia hosted the most recent deployment. ""The hunt was thorough and successful, and we discovered and prevented malicious attacks on Croatian state infrastructure,"" Daniel Markić, the head of the country's security and intelligence agency, says.
""We were able to offer the US a new 'hunting ground' for malicious actors and share our experience and acquired knowledge,"" he adds.
But warm public statements mask the reality that these missions often begin uneasily. 
Even countries allied to the US can be nervous about allowing the US to root around inside sensitive government networks. In fact, revelations from former intelligence contractor Edward Snowden 10 years ago suggested that the US spied on friends as well as enemies.
uspicion means the young men and women arriving on a mission are often faced with a stern test of their diplomatic skills. They show up at an airport hauling dozens of boxes of mysterious technical equipment and need to quickly build trust to get permission to do something sensitive - install that equipment on the host country's government computer networks to scan for threats. 
""That is a pretty scary proposition if you're a host nation,"" explains Gen Hartman. ""You immediately have some concern that we're going to go do something nefarious or it's some super-secret kind of backdoor operation.""
Put simply, the Americans need to convince their hosts they are there to help them - and not to spy on them.
""I'm not interested in your emails,"" is how Mark, who led two teams in the Indo-Pacific region, describes his opening gambit. If a demonstration goes well they can get down to work.
Local partners sometimes sit with US teams around in conference rooms observing closely to make sure nothing untoward is going on. ""We have to make sure we convey that trust,"" says Eric, a 20-year veteran of cyber operations. ""Having people sit side-saddle with us is a big factor in developing that.""  
And although suspicion can never be totally dispelled, a common adversary binds them together.
""The one thing that these partners want is the Russians out of their networks,"" Gen Hartman recalls one of his team telling him. 
US Cyber Command offers an insight into what the Russians, or others, are up to, particularly since it works closely with the National Security Agency, America's largest intelligence agency which monitors communications and cyberspace.
In one case, proof of infiltration came in real-time. One US operator, Chris, who has led multiple European missions, recalls observing someone move suspiciously around the computer network of a partner country. 
What was bizarre was that it appeared to be one of the local network administrators the team was working with. That person was standing right behind Chris. Could it be some kind of insider threat?
""Is that you?"" Chris asked. 
""That is my computer, but I swear that's not me,"" the administrator responded, transfixed as if watching a movie. Someone had stolen his online identity. 
""Finding someone on your network is not a good moment especially when they are using your credentials,"" Chris recalls. That moment conveyed the reality of the threat and in turn helped secure more access. 
US teams say they share what they find to allow the local partner to eject Russians (or other state hackers) rather than do it themselves. They also use commercial tools so that local partners can continue after the mission is over. 
A good relationship can pay dividends. At the end of one mission, US operators say that local partners handed them a parting gift - a computer disc containing malicious software, or malware, from another network the team had not been inside.
Each mission is different and there are some where an adversary has been found on the very first day of looking, explains Shannon who has led two missions in Europe. But it often takes a week or two to unearth more advanced hackers who have burrowed deeper.
A cat-and-mouse game is often played with hackers from Russian intelligence agencies who are particularly adept at changing tactics.
In 2021, it emerged the Russians had used software from a company called SolarWinds to infiltrate the networks of the customers who bought it, including governments.
US operators began looking for traces of their presence. A tech sergeant in Cyber Command who liked puzzles spotted the way the Russians were hiding their code in one European country, General Hartman says. Unscrambling it, he was able to establish the Russians were hiding on a network. Eight different samples of malicious software, all attributed to Russian intelligence, were then made public to allow industry to improve defences. 
Hunting is not an altruistic act by the US military. As well as providing hands-on experience for its teams, it can also help at home. In one mission, a young enlisted cyber operator found the same malware they had discovered in a European country was also present on a US government agency. The US has often struggled to identify and root out vulnerabilities domestically, whether in industry or government, because of overlapping responsibilities between different agencies even as it sends out its operators abroad.
Hunt Forward missions are classed as ""defensive"" but Gen Paul Nakasone, who leads both the military's Cyber Command and the National Security Agency confirmed offensive missions have also been undertaken against Russia in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. But he and others declined to provide further detail.
January, the team in Ukraine were trying to avoid slipping on icy pavements when a series of major cyber-attacks hit. ""Be afraid and expect the worst,"" read a message posted by hackers on the Foreign Ministry website.
US team watched in real-time as a wave of so-called wiper software, which renders computers unusable, hit multiple government websites.  
""They were able to assist in analysing some of the ongoing attacks, and facilitate that information being shared back to partners in the United States,"" Gen Hartman says.
m was to destabilise the country ahead of the February invasion.
By the time Russian troops flooded over the border, the US team had been pulled out. Knowledge of the physical risk for their Ukrainian partners who remained weighed heavily on them.
Hours before the invasion began on 24 February, a cyber-attack crippled a US satellite communications provider that supported the Ukrainian military. Many predicted this would be the start of a wave of attacks to take down key areas like railways. But that did not happen.
""One of the reasons the Russians may not have been so successful is that the Ukrainians were better prepared,"" says Gen Hartman. 
""There's a lot of pride in the way they were able to defend. A lot of the world thought they would just be run over. And they weren't,"" says Al, a senior technical analyst who was part of the Ukrainian deployment team. ""They resisted.""
Ukraine has been subject to continued cyber-attacks which, if successful, could have affected infrastructure. But the country has continued to defend itself better than many expected. Ukrainian officials have said that this has been in part thanks to help from allies, including US Cyber Command and the private sector as well as their own growing experience. Now, the US and other allies are turning to the Ukrainians to learn from them. 
""We continue to share information with the Ukrainians, they continue to share information with us,"" explains Gen Hartman. ""That's really the whole idea of that enduring partnership."" 
With Ukrainian and Western intelligence officials expressing concerns that Moscow may respond to recent military setbacks by escalating its cyber-attacks, it is a partnership that may still face further tests."	/news/uk-63328398

business	Fukushima bosses ordered to pay $97bn in damages	"Former bosses of the operator of the Fukushima nuclear power plant have been ordered to pay 13 trillion yen (£80bn) for failing to prevent a disaster.
from the Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco) were sued by shareholders over the 2011 meltdown which was triggered by a tsunami.
urt judged that the executives could have prevented the accident if they had exercised due care.
gised but declined to comment on the court case.
""We deeply apologise for the immense burden and deep concern the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station of Tepco Holdings is causing local residents and society at large,"" a statement said.
Plaintiffs emerged from the Tokyo court holding banners reading ""shareholders win"" and ""responsibility recognised"".
r lawyers said they believed it to be the largest amount of compensation ever awarded in a civil lawsuit in Japan.
knowledged 13 trillion yen was ""well beyond"" the former bosses capacity to pay, but that the plaintiffs expect the men to pay as much as their assets allow.
""One accident with a nuclear power plant leads to irreversible damage to both human lives and the environment,"" said Yui Kimura, one of the plaintiffs.
""The executives of companies that operate such plants also have a huge responsibility on them that is incomparable with other companies.""
""I think the court's judgement says that anyone who does not have the determination or capability to take on that responsibility should not become an executive.""
Fukushima nuclear disaster happened on 11 March 2011 when a massive earthquake off north-east Japan triggered a tsunami which led to a nuclear meltdown.
It was the worst nuclear power incident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, but has been considered less damaging to local people because far lower quantities of radioactive iodine were released.
No one was killed in the disaster, but the long-term effects of the radiation remain a matter of debate. 
Fukushima fishermen worried about nuclear water release plan
reholders argued the 2011 disaster could have been prevented if bosses had listened to research and carried out preventative measures like placing an emergency power source on higher ground.
urt ruled nuclear plant operators have ""an obligation to prevent severe accidents based on the latest scientific and expert engineering knowledge"", and the executives failed to heed credible warnings.
mages from the former bosses are intended to cover the costs to Tepco for dismantling the reactors, compensating affected residents and cleaning up contamination.

A statement by the plaintiffs' lawyers said the case was based on the ""most comprehensive examination of evidence regarding the cause of the Fukushima nuclear accident"".
""Defendants should deeply apologise to the inhabitants and obey this ruling without appealing if they are willing to reflect on the devastating damage caused by the nuclear accident to many inhabitants,"" it said.
Separately, the Tokyo district court found three Tepco executives not guilty of professional negligence in a criminal trial in 2019, where they judged that they could not have foreseen the tsunami.

technology	What is behind the big tech companies' job cuts?	"first sign of job cuts at Amazon came from LinkedIn posts from laid-off employees.
, Amazon's devices boss, Dave Limp, announced: ""It pains me... We will lose talented Amazonians from the devices & services org"".
Across the tech industry, at firms like Twitter, Meta, Coinbase and Snap, workers have announced they are ""seeking new opportunities"".
Worldwide, more than 120,000 jobs have been lost, according to the Layoffs.fyi website, which tracks tech job cuts.
Different firms cut employees for different reasons but there are common themes.
As our lives moved online during the pandemic, the tech giants' businesses boomed, and executives believed the good times - for them - would continue to roll.
Meta, for example, took on more than 15,000 people in the first nine months of this year.
Now executives announcing cuts have said they miscalculated.
""I made the decision to significantly increase our investments,"" chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees, as he laid off 13% of them.
""Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.""
Online adverts are the chief source of income for many tech firms, but for the advertising business, dark clouds have been gathering. Firms have faced growing opposition to intrusive advertising practices. For example, Apple made it harder to track people's online activity and sell that data to advertisers. 
And as the economy ran into trouble, many firms slashed their online advertising budgets.
In the financial technology sector, rising interest rates have also hit companies.
""It's been a really a disappointing quarter of earnings for many of the big tech companies,"" said technology analyst Paolo Pescatore of PP Foresight. ""No-one's immune.""
Even Apple has signalled caution, with chief executive Tim Cook saying the firm was ""still hiring"", but only on a ""deliberate basis."" 
Amazon attributed its job cuts to an ""unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment"" forcing it to prioritize on what mattered most to customers.
""As part of our annual operating planning review process, we always look at each of our businesses and what we believe we should change,"" spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. 
""As we've gone through this, given the current macro-economic environment (as well as several years of rapid hiring), some teams are making adjustments, which in some cases means certain roles are no longer necessary. We don't take these decisions lightly, and we are working to support any employees who may be affected.""
Investors have also piled on the pressure to cut costs, accusing firms of being bloated and slow to respond to signs of slowdown.
In an open letter to Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, activist investor Sir Christopher Hohn urged the firm to slash jobs and pay.
Alphabet had to be more disciplined about costs, he wrote, and cut losses from projects like its self-driving car company, Waymo.
Elon Musk is certainly of the view that there is room to cut costs at his latest investment, Twitter, which has struggled to either turn a profit or attract new users.
Added to that, many commentators argue Mr Musk paid over the odds for the firm, and the pressure is on to make his investment worthwhile.
He laid off half the firm's employees; and for those who remain an ""extreme"" work ethic is promised.
According to US media reports on Tuesday, Mr Musk told staff they needed to commit to a ""hardcore"" culture of ""long hours at high intensity"" or leave. 
Industry watcher Scott Kessler also says there is less tolerance for big spending on high-tech gambles like virtual reality or driverless cars that may not pay off in the short term.
Investors also see the high wages and cushy perks some enjoy in the industry as unsustainable.
""Some companies have had to face harsh realities,"" he said.
Mike Morini, from WorkForce Software, which provides digital management tools said it appeared to be a turning point.
""The tech industry is exiting a period of growth at all costs,"" he said.
But while the big tech firms may be buffeted by economic headwinds, they are not broken.
Amazon's proposed 10,000 job cuts in corporate and technology roles - its biggest such reduction to date - represents only 3% of its office staff.
And the lay-offs may also be the start of new businesses as talented staff, dumped by the big firms, join or create start-ups.
As veteran Silicon Valley watcher Mike Malone recently told the BBC: ""I won't write the Valley off yet. I still have a lot of hope."""	/news/technology-63635821
