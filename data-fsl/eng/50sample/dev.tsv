Britain's world number 51 beat world number one and defending champion Alessio Foconi on his way to the final.
""I would have liked to have fenced better in the final to show off the sport a little more but I'm proud of what I have achieved,"" he said.
""The semi-final was really tough.  In fact everyone I fenced was really good so I think I've done really well.
""Since moving to coach Dan Kellner, based in New York, my preparation is a little better and my self-confidence has grown.""
Kellner added: ""I'm just so proud of Marcus.  The lead-up to this event wasn't the best. Marcus got sick, cut his hand and needed stitches and then had to miss his final training sessions.""
Richard Kruse won silver in the foil at the 2018 World Championships in China, Britain's first medal since Bill Hoskyns claimed epee silver in 1965.

entertainment	Unboxed: Spending watchdog to investigate government's £120m arts festival	"National Audit Office (NAO) is to examine the delivery and value for money of the Unboxed festival.
It comes after the chair of a parliamentary committee called for an investigation into the £120m arts festival, criticising it as an ""excessive waste of money"".
Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""We do not agree with the select committee's views.""
Unboxed was announced in 2018 by then prime minister Theresa May. 
UK-wide free event, which began in March and will run until November, features 10 projects highlighting science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics.
But the government's ""celebration of creativity"" was soon dubbed the Festival of Brexit, and has since had its visitor numbers questioned.
In late August, an article published in parliament's The House magazine claimed suggested there had been fewer than 240,000 visitors, despite a proposed target of 66 million.
However Unboxed told the BBC on Tuesday that ""the numbers reported misrepresent the public engagement with Unboxed, and reflect attendance at only eight of the 107 physical locations from within the programme"". 
Last month, Unboxed chief creative officer Martin Green told the BBC the festival was ""absolutely value for money"".
DCMS said on Tuesday that ""more than four million people have engaged in Unboxed programming so far, and these numbers are set to rise further"". 
Conservative MP Julian Knight, chair of the DCMS select committee, which holds the government department to account, has questioned the money spent on the festival ""during a cost of living crisis"".
rompted him to ask the NAO, the UK's independent public spending watchdog, to investigate.  
In a letter published on Tuesday, the NAO's comptroller and auditor general Gareth Davies, confirmed that the Unboxed organisers and government would now come under greater scrutiny over the event.
""I propose in in the coming months to publish a short, focused report on Unboxed which could act as the basis for future questioning during a committee session with DCMS,"" Mr Davies wrote.
He added he expected they should be able to report on the costs and benefits associated with the festival, along with its management and planning work - including forecasting of visitor numbers.
Mr Knight told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the event was ""unfortunately a monumental waste of money"".
""And it's something we've warned about,"" he added. ""And actually even within the department [it] was something that effectively they felt as if it was going off the rails. But no-one said, 'Stop, let's reassess. And if necessary, let's cancel.'""
However the DCMS responded by saying Unboxed had ""helped open up access to arts and culture across the country with an inclusive and ground-breaking programme of live and digital events, designed to bring people together and delivered in partnership with the devolved nations of the UK."".
Unboxed added that its commissions have been presented in ""more than 100 towns, cities and villages, engaged millions across live and digital and employed thousands of creatives around the UK"". 
Features of the festival include the See Monster installation in Weston-super-Mare - intended to promote the conversation about climate change - and Birmingham's PoliNations, as well as the About Us installation at Paisley Abbey in Scotland.
Unboxed organisers have not yet released official visitor numbers, but Mr Green told BBC Culture correspondent Katie Razzall last month that ""millions"" of people had engaged with it in person, and that he was ""very confident"" the festival would hit its visitor targets.
In June, the government said in response to its report on major cultural and sporting events that it disagreed with the committee's assessment of Unboxed, insisting it was ""being promoted globally"". "	/news/entertainment-arts-63203780
technology	Ex-Google ad boss builds tracker-free search engine	"An advert- and tracker-free search engine launches in the UK, France and Germany on Thursday.
Neeva has 600,000 users in the US, where it launched last year.
Creator Sridhar Ramaswamy, who worked at Google for 16 years and ran its ad business, told BBC News the technology sector had become ""exploitative"" of people's data, something he no longer wanted to be a part of.
rackers share information about online activity, largely to target adverts.
Neeva has raised $77.5m (£68m) from investors. 
It offers free-to-use search, with other features such as password-manager access and virtual-private-network (VPN) service to be made available on a subscription basis. 
Users are asked to create an account, to build subscriptions at a later date.
And the UK price was likely to be about £5 per month, Mr Ramaswamy said.
""We felt the traditional search engines had become about advertising and advertisers - and not really about serving users,"" he said.
""Google has a dominant position in the marketplace - and the incentive for them to truly innovate, to truly create disruptive experiences, is not really there. 
""And then also as a company they feel obligated to show more and more revenue and profit to their shareholders, so they just keep increasing the number of ads.""
Search the word ""migraine"" on both Google and Neeva, and the first page of the results are fairly similar - links to news articles and factual information.
But with a brand, the difference becomes more stark. 
When I try ""BMW"", both search engines lead with links to the carmaker's website and Wikipedia entry.
But while Google follows with a map, social-media feeds and links to used-car dealers, Neeva sticks with different BMW official pages. 
Google certainly has more variety - but it is also blatantly pushing me towards buying a car.
Neeva's Chrome browser extension lists the trackers installed on web pages visited.
I tried a few:
And almost all - but not the BBC - had at least one belonging to Google, meaning Google is receiving anonymised information about users visiting those pages. 
While I had the extension activated, no ads displayed around the editorial content.
But ultimately, none of Neeva's other rivals has dented the dominance of Google search. 
""To Bing"" or ""to Duckduckgo"" - another privacy-focused service - are not verbs in the way ""to google"" is. 
And asked if Mr Ramaswamy could ever topple his former employer, Steph Liu, an analyst at Forrester specialising in privacy and search, said: ""Realistically, no.
""It's a sort of David and Goliath story. Google has too many users, it has too much revenue.
""The ultimate goal is to offer an alternative for the consumer base who are worried about their privacy, who don't want Google hoovering up their data and targeting ads based on their search history""."	/news/technology-63130364
politics	Boris Johnson did the right thing, says Scottish Tory MP	"Boris Johnson ended his bid to return as prime minister in the national interest, a Scottish Conservative MP has said. 
Since the ex-PM announced on Sunday that he would not put his name forward, Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt remain in the running to replace Liz Truss. 
MP Andrew Bowie told BBC Scotland Mr Johnson had done the ""right thing"". 
Nicola Sturgeon said she was relieved that the ""ridiculous notion"" of his return was ""knocked on the head"".
race for the party's new leader was set in motion after Liz Truss was forced to stand down after 45 days in office - the shortest premiership of any UK prime minister.
Ms Truss's policy programme spooked the financial markets and her successor will be tasked with establishing stability.
Candidates with 100 or more supporters will proceed in the process, which states a winner should be announced on Friday. However, if only one candidate reaches the threshold they could become leader on Monday.
Mr Sunak is the firm favourite to replace Ms Truss as PM and could do so by as early as Monday afternoon if Ms Mordaunt fails to meet the benchmark.
According to BBC figures, which are being updated here, former chancellor Mr Sunak has 193 Conservative MPs who have publicly given him their backing, while Ms Mordaunt has 26.
question remains as to whether Ms Mordaunt can get 100 MPs to back her before nominations close at 14:00 BST.
Speaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme Mr Bowie, Conservative MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine, said Mr Johnson - who only stood down as prime minister seven weeks ago - stepping out of the leadership race was the ""right thing to do"". 
""I think what Boris did yesterday was definitely in the national interest,"" he said. ""The last thing we need is another prolonged battle for the heart and soul of the Conservative party. 
""We need to get this done quickly and get it over with as soon as possible in the national interest so we can get the economy on a firm footing and move the whole country forward.
""A general election, even for a snap general election, by law necessitates six weeks of campaigning. That is six weeks when parliament isn't sitting and six weeks where government isn't getting down to business.""
Mr Bowie, who is backing Rishi Sunak, added: ""Looking at the numbers it was clear that had he entered the race he would have been beaten in the MP's ballot.""
Boris Johnson's final months in office were dogged by accusations he broke ministerial rules by not telling the truth about parties in Downing Street during the Covid lockdown.
He remains under investigation by the Parliamentary Standards Committee, which could lead to him being suspended from Parliament, or being kicked out as an MP.
On Sunday, Scottish Conservatives chairman Craig Hoy told BBC Scotland his colleagues were ""very frustrated"" by the UK party's leadership turmoil and wanted to focus on holding the SNP to account over independence.
first minister said people were tired of the ""Tory soap opera psychodrama"".
""It is appalling given the difficulties people across the country are living through right now,"" Ms Sturgeon said. 
She added: ""I think everybody will breathe a sigh of relief that the ridiculous notion of Johnson coming back as prime minister has been knocked on the head."" 
But Ms Sturgeon said what the next prime minster does would be more important than their personality.
""What is of profound concern to everybody, particularly to me right now, is that the Tories are about to unleash another wave of austerity on all of us. It is going to be a horror show,"" the first minister said. 
""Scottish public services, cannot withstand, in my view, another round of Tory austerity.
""We need an alternative to that and if Rishi Sunak becomes prime minister today or later in the week, as I suspect he will, what we know is that next Monday his chancellor is going to stand up in the House of Commons and unveil a round of cuts that the Scottish government and public services are going to be powerless to withstand.""
Former Conservative MEP Lord Ian Duncan said he did not think there should be a general election, despite the last one in 2019 seeming ""like a lifetime ago"", or a return to the Conservative party members deciding on their next leader.
""Right now we do need a period of stability and once we've got that stability then it is time for an election,"" he said. ""But at that point, I wonder if Ian Blackford will be shouting in exactly the same way because at that point there may well be a restoration in the fortunes of the Tory party.""
But he agreed that Mr Johnson was right not to attempt to become prime minister again. 
""Boris may well have been a vote winner but once you've shot yourself in both feet it's very hard to run a race,"" Lord Duncan said.  
""Right now we need to have a period where common sense applies to the economy and it will be judged not wholly by the people but actually by the markets themselves. The markets will determine whether the common sense is working or not."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63371577
politics	Haverhill council asks Hancock to quit over I'm a Celeb	"A town council has called on former health secretary Matt Hancock to quit as the local MP after he signed up for I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!
Mr Hancock was suspended by the Conservatives after he joined the ITV show while Parliament was sitting.
Haverhill Town Council has written a letter expressing its ""displeasure"" at his participation on the show and urged him to resign as West Suffolk MP. 
Mr Hancock's office said he ""is still working on constituency matters"".
Earlier in the week, Mr Hancock defended his decision and sources close to him said it was an ""incredible opportunity for him to engage with the 12m Brits"", using his time in the Australian jungle to promote his dyslexia campaign.
ment added: ""Matt has an excellent team working with him in West Suffolk, but producers have agreed that he can communicate with them if there's an urgent constituency matter.""
In a letter to Mr Hancock, Haverhill Town Council's clerk Colin Poole said by a majority vote members directed him to ""express their displeasure"" at the MP's decision to absent himself from constituency duties.
""At a time when unprecedented cost-of-living pressures on your residents are causing real hardship to them... my members believe we need all hands on deck to fight our corner.
""Currently there is nobody to speak for West Suffolk in the House of Commons,"" the letter said.
It added: ""By your actions you have made it clear to everyone that you see your future outside of politics.
""My members ask that you do the honourable thing and resign your seat.""
Mr Hancock's office said the second reading of his Dyslexia Screening and Teacher Training Bill was expected days after the current series ends.
As a result, he said Mr Hancock's appearance on the ITV show was ""an amazing opportunity for Matt to raise the profile of his dyslexia bill and to talk about an issue he really cares about in front of millions of people"".
""As well as raising awareness of dyslexia, Matt will be raising thousands of pounds for charity off the back of his appearance - with donations going to both St Nicholas Hospice in Suffolk, and the British Dyslexia Association,"" the spokesman said.
""Matt is still working on constituency matters and has held a number of online meetings this week already.""
Earlier this week, a number of groups, politicians and constituents spoke out against Mr Hancock appearing on the reality show, where contestants face gruelling challenges involving spiders, snakes and bugs.
Mr Hancock has been out of government since he resigned as health secretary, after he broke coronavirus lockdown rules by having an affair in his departmental office.
After that incident, councillors on Newmarket Town Council, also in his constituency, passed a vote of no confidence in the West Suffolk MP.
former health secretary will be a late addition to the ITV show, which returns to Australia this year and will star Euro 2022 winner Jill Scott, ex-rugby star Mike Tindall and singer Boy George, among others.
ry chief whip said Mr Hancock's participation on the show while Parliament was sitting was ""serious enough"" to warrant suspension.
When MPs have the whip suspended, they are kicked out of the party within Parliament, but remain an MP and continue to be paid.

entertainment	Nandi Bushell releases debut single written to 'cheer up Dad'	"A schoolgirl who has performed with some of the world's biggest rock stars has released a new single inspired by her dad's health struggles.
Nandi Bushell, 12, of Ipswich, Suffolk, has bookended this month by drumming at the Foo Fighters' Taylor Hawkins memorial gig and launching her track. 
multi-instrumentalist has also won the attention of Barack Obama and tech giant Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
Nandi said: ""I wrote a song to cheer [my dad] up.""
mpanying video to The Shadows, released on 30 September, charts Nandi's journey from toying around with instruments in her former South African home as a toddler to playing guitars and drums with her dad, with current studio footage of her playing a grand piano.
Quick Q&A with drumming star Nandi Bushell
""The single is about how my dad went through depression... because his auto-immune disease was worsening,"" said Nandi. 
""He told me and he was really upset so I made a song about it.""
Mr Bushell said he felt Nandi's song had ""genuinely helped him"" and hoped it would have the same impact on other people.
""I was having flare-ups all over my body and I was feeling really, really terrible,"" he said.
""Nandi was asking me questions and I was describing how I felt trapped in the bed and in my room, and she said how she wanted to do something to cheer me up. I said all my rainbows felt like they were turning to black. 
""She said, 'Let me put these words into the song,' and finished it by saying, 'I'll be there for you'. I thought this is incredible, [it was] such a beautiful moment.""
r hope the track will reach a wide audience, fuelled in part by Nandi's 2.5m social media followers, a forthcoming appearance on children's TV programme Blue Peter this Monday and her meeting this week with Apple chief Mr Cook.
Her profile has been boosted following a string of extraordinary events including performing with Lenny Kravitz, appearing on US talk show Ellen and writing a song in 2021 with ex-Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello and his son Roman, which former US President Barack Obama posted on his Facebook page.
However, it is her enduring link-up with Foo Fighters that has continued to make headlines after she challenged frontman Dave Grohl to a drum battle during one of the coronavirus lockdowns. It led him to write Nandi a song and he invited her to perform with them at The Forum in Los Angeles last year.
It was there that the band's drummer Taylor Hawkins, who died aged 50 earlier this year, gave the young prodigy his drumsticks.
Poignantly, Nandi used them during her performance for Learn to Fly at his Wembley Stadium tribute gig.
""There was this balcony where I could see the gig happening - it was emotional,"" said Nandi.
She said appearing at both gigs, along with playing at the Queen's Platinum Jubilee concert where she cried after meeting her hero Stephen Fry, had been the highlights of her life so far.
But for now her sights are set on her single release and her forthcoming EP, Into The Abyss, released later this year.
""If one person who is going through a difficult time listens to that song and decides to reach out for help, then that is a measure of success,"" said Mr Bushell.

business	Over-50s turn to house-shares to beat rising rents	"rising cost of renting and buying a house has led to more over-50s looking for house and flat-shares, according to property-sharing websites.
It's something that is normally associated with younger people but what is it like sharing when you're over 50?
Karen Miles, 66, moved into a 13-person house five years ago to save money.
She was previously living in a one-bedroom flat just outside Eastbourne but struggled to cover her bills alongside rent of around £560 a month. 
Now she pays £500 a month for a room, excluding bills, in a shared house in the town. 
Her housemates are a mix of ages, ranging from early-20s to early-50s. While she gets on with everyone, they don't tend to socialise together and Karen, who works part-time as a housekeeper, said sharing with younger people can pose problems. 
She has previously had issues with some flatmates being noisy and the shared kitchen and bathroom can get dirty quickly. 
However, she said there were also benefits of having other people around to chat to. 
""If I moved in somewhere on my own, I think I probably would feel a bit lonely,"" she added. 
Karen has tried to look for a one-bedroom flat to rent but with prices increasing she has struggled to find something affordable. 
She would also like to share with friends but said it can be difficult for older people to find someone of a similar age to rent with. 
""My friends have got husbands and family so it's hard,"" she said. 
Leading flat-sharing site SpareRoom said it had seen a 239% increase in 55 to 64-year-olds looking for house-shares since 2011 and a 114% increase for the 45-to-54 age group. 
However people aged 25 to 34 years old still make up the majority of sharers. 
Meanwhile, Cohabitas, a site for over-40s, said it had seen a 51% increase in users aged 55 to 64. 
SpareRoom communications director Matt Hutchinson said the primary reason more older people were house-sharing was affordability. 
He told BBC News the increased cost of renting and buying a home meant more people were sharing for longer and becoming ""lifetime renters"", while people who had come out of long-term relationships and might originally have bought or rented a one-bedroom flat were now ""priced out"". 
Mr Hutchinson said he expected the trend to continue as housing and other costs increased further. 
Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said official figures also suggest renters are getting older. 
She added that figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest the cost of living crisis is felt more by renters than homeowners, as they spend a greater proportion of their income on housing. 
re also more exposed to rent increases as many mortgage-holders are on fixed rates. 
Rental prices in the UK have been increasing steadily since Covid restrictions were eased in the summer of 2021, according to the ONS. 
High demand has contributed to rental prices increasing by 3.2% in the 12 months to July - the largest annual growth rate since January 2016.
For April to June, property website Rightmove found average asking rents outside London hit a record £1,126 per month - up 11.8% on the same period last year. 
Cohabitas, a website which advertises house-shares for people over-40, also said it had seen increased demand from older age groups since it was founded in 2016. 
Over the past six months, it said it had seen a 44% increase in users compared to the same period last year. 
For 55 to 64-year-olds the increase was 51%, while for 45 to 54-year-olds it was 35%.  
Co-founder Eva Orasch said the long-term trends driving the increase in sharing among older age groups were the UK's ageing population and increased house prices. 
In the short-term, she said the rising cost of living and the pandemic were also contributing, with some people no longer wanting to live alone after lockdown. 
In a 2021 survey of more than 1,500 users, the website found 45% of respondents had chosen to share for purely financial reasons, while 48% were sharing for both financial and social reasons. 
Susan Laybourn, 58, also started house-sharing to save money in March 2020. 
Most recently she has been sharing with a live-in landlady who is a similar age to her, as well as a man in his 20s, in Trefnant, north Wales. 
After getting a job in the area, Susan, who works as a locum podiatrist for the NHS, could not find anywhere affordable to rent on her own. 
Many houses in the area are let as holiday homes and Susan said demand for rented properties already outstripped supply. 
""At one point, I did consider just trying to find somewhere on my own and there was a couple of flats going in Rhyl, which is nearby,"" she said. 
""But by the time I rang up to inquire about them they said 'oh, sorry, they're already gone'.""
She added that not having a permanent job and often needing a shorter-term rental contract because of this also counted against her when trying to find somewhere to rent. 
Ideally, Susan said she would prefer to live alone or with just one other person her own age - and she could afford to do so - but it was much cheaper to share. Her current room is £400 a month including bills. 
""If I could find anywhere here on my own I'd probably be paying at least £200 more just for the rent, and then you've got bills on top,"" she said. 
""And when you hear about energy bills are going to go through the roof and everything, I think I'm glad I'm not private renting [on my own] because I feel like I'd just be wasting money, when I could be saving it.""
She would also like to buy her own flat in the future but believes her age and lack of permanent job means she would not be able to get a mortgage. 
Susan said she did enjoy having company, especially when moving to a new area, and she gets on well with her live-in landlady. 
However, she said it can be hard to find someone her own age to share with as there is still a stigma associated with older people house-sharing. 
In the past she said she felt ""almost ashamed"" that she was not able to rent her own place. 
""I've kind of come to terms with it now and try to see the positives in it, rather than the negatives."""	/news/business-62344571
business	Oil price rises as EU cuts Russian imports	"Oil prices have hit fresh highs after European Union leaders agreed on a plan to block more than two-thirds of Russian oil imports.
Brent crude rose above $123 a barrel on Tuesday, the highest it has been for two months.
Prices for oil and gas have soared in recent months, fuelled by the lifting of lockdowns and the Ukraine war.
Rising energy costs are putting pressure on consumers, making it more expensive to heat homes and drive.
Petrol hit a new record of 173.02p a litre on Monday, according to the AA.
At the same time, the average price of diesel in the UK rose to 182.58p a litre, it said.
Filling a typical 55-litre tank of a diesel now costs more than £100.
war in Ukraine has pushed countries in the West to shun Russian energy supplies.
Russia currently supplies 27% of the EU's imported oil and 40% of its gas. The EU pays Russia around €400bn (£341bn) a year in return.
greed by EU leaders will see an immediate ban on Russian oil being transported into the bloc by sea. Two-thirds of Russian oil arrives by sea.
However, the deal, which followed weeks of wrangling, includes a temporary exemption for pipeline oil following opposition from Hungary.
Pledges by Poland and Germany to stop importing pipeline oil by the end of this year will raise coverage of the ban to 90% of Russian imports.
Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil prices, has risen more than 70% over the past year.
Oil prices climbed again on news of the EU embargo, with Brent crude reaching its highest level since March.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said confirmation that the EU will cut its purchases of Russian oil by the end of 2022 is pushing up prices because European countries now need to find alternative sources of supply.
""It is not feasible to replace that amount of energy with other fuel sources, such as wind, solar, biomass or nuclear, in such a short space of time, so the EU needs to find oil and gas from somewhere,"" Mr Mould said.
""This will not be easy because existing global output may well be on contract already, so competition for what is not on contract will now be hotter.""
Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the upwards trajectory of oil prices may continue until Western countries outline clearly how supply is going to be sourced.
""It's possible this could get tougher before it gets better,"" she said.
""We know that rising energy costs are a particular challenge for households which already have severe pressure on their incomes, but smaller businesses shouldn't be left out of the equation either - this is a tough time to be heating offices, and at a time when it's meant to be about rebuilding resilience after the pandemic.""
European Council chief Charles Michel said the deal cut off ""a huge source of financing"" for the Russian war machine.
It is part of a sixth package of sanctions approved at a summit in Brussels, which all 27 member states have had to agree on.
So far, no sanctions on Russian gas exports to the EU have been put in place, although plans to open a new gas pipeline from Russia to Germany have been frozen.
EU members spent hours struggling to resolve their differences over the ban on Russian oil imports.
Hungary, which imports 65% of its oil from Russia through pipelines, resisted the new round of sanctions.
f living crisis being felt across Europe has not helped either. Sky-rocketing energy prices - among other things - have curtailed some EU countries' appetite for sanctions which could also hurt their own economies."	/news/business-61643613
technology	Security warning after sale of stolen Chinese data	"President Xi Jinping has urged public bodies to ""defend information security"" after a hacker offered to sell stolen data of one billion Chinese citizens.
In an advert on a criminal forum, later removed, the user said the data was stolen from Shanghai National Police.
ker claims the information includes names, addresses, National ID numbers and mobile phone numbers. 
Cyber-security experts have verified that at least some of a small sample of the data offered is real.
23 terabytes of data is thought to be the largest ever sale of data on record and was being offered for $200,000 (£166,000) until the post was removed on Friday.
No Chinese officials have responded to the news and President Xi did not make direct reference to the data sale.
But, according to the South China Morning Post, the president has asked public bodies in China to ""defend information security… to protect personal information, privacy and confidential corporate information"" to ensure people feel secure when submitting data for public services.
On Friday, the moderators of the website where the sale was listed - by a user called ChinaDan - posted a notice which read: ""Dear Chinese users, welcome to our forum. You most likely came here because of the Shanghai police database leak. The data is no longer being sold, and posts related to this topic have been deleted.""
website administrators then added that they have many other similar and high quality Chinese databases for sale, adding: ""We are not in China and we are not Chinese, so we do not have to obey Chinese laws.""
According to DarkTracer, which monitors cyber criminal activity, another hacker - perhaps inspired by the publicity surrounding ChinaDan's offer - posted an advert on Tuesday for 90 million Chinese citizen records, which the hacker claims to have stolen from Henan National Police (HNGA). None of that data has been verified.
""It remains unclear exactly why the data has been withdrawn,"" Toby Lewis, global head of threat analysis at Darktrace said. 
""The original offer of sale suggests that the hacker was looking to sell the data to several buyers without exclusivity, rather than just one. 
""So one theory is that for a high enough price exclusivity could have been bought, and that kind of purchase could possibly have been made by the Chinese state itself.""
Mr Lewis believes the leaked information could have been a major concern for Chinese authorities which reportedly blocked discussions of the sale on Chinese social networks shortly after it was advertised.
Deb Leary, CEO of Forensic Pathways, also believes the data may have been sold to a high bidder, but adds: ""It's interesting, and not unexpected, that the hacker forum used the incident as a way to promote themselves as a go-to place for stolen data. 
""They don't seem to be worried about angering the Chinese authorities.""
In April a popular hacking website called Raid Forums was seized and shut down in an international police operation led by the FBI. 
's Portuguese founder, and a British man based in Croydon, were arrested.
Large data sets such as the Chinese cache can be used by hackers to send impersonation emails and other malicious attacks to trick people into handing over cash to criminals.
But now the data has disappeared it may never be possible to verify it.
Another theory is that the data and ChinaDan could have been discovered to be fake by the website administrators.
However Louise Ferrett, Threat Analyst at Searchlight Security, thinks the data could well be genuine.
""There are indications that the data on sale was legitimate. Firstly, the source of the data has been reported by some security teams as human error on the part of a government developer,"" she said.
""Secondly, multiple sources have confirmed that the sample data that the seller, known as ChinaDan, provided was legitimate. 
""This doesn't necessarily mean the entire database was real but these two elements combined do certainly make it more likely,"" said Mrs Ferrett. "	/news/technology-62097594
politics	Brexit: French tourism slump after leaving EU, Brittany Ferries says	"umber of people arriving at a UK port from France has more than halved after Brexit, a ferry firm has said.
Portsmouth ferry port saw 338,000 arrivals in 2019 but only 155,000 in 2022, according to Brittany Ferries.
firm said ""Brexit-related friction"" including a need for passports was a major factor, although sailings to and from Ireland, within the European Union, had seen increased business.
Home Office said the UK's entry rules were relatively generous.
Brittany Ferries said the vast majority of lost visitors were French holidaymakers, including student groups.
Spokesman Nigel Wonnacott said: ""We used to have loads of coaches parking outside with happy schoolchildren enjoying Portsmouth, going up to London and we really don't see much of that any more.
""Post-Brexit, French travellers are required to travel [to the UK] with a passport so it's expensive for them to get a passport because it's about 90 euros (£78), and it's also a big administrative burden.
""For Portsmouth, for the surroundings, for UK plc it's the loss of a significant number of potential travellers and all the richness that they bring economically and culturally.""
Previously the Tourism Alliance, which represents the British tourism industry, estimated a £875m loss to the UK economy from lost student groups in 2022.
Brittany Ferries said many French visitors had switched to its sailings to Ireland.
Last year saw a 30% increase in passengers travelling on its routes between Ireland, and both France and Spain, compared to 2019, the firm said.
Brittany Ferries operates services from France to Rosslare in Ireland and to Plymouth, Poole and Portsmouth in England.
A Home Office spokesman said the UK's rules were ""among the most generous in the world"".
kesman said visitors from France and other affected countries were told almost a year in advance of the requirement to use a passport from October 2021.

health	Sheffield Covid coma musician relearns guitar for comeback	"A musician who spent more than two years relearning to sing and play the guitar after being in a coma is to perform a comeback gig with his band. 
Graham Rodgers nearly died after suffering a stroke and further complications following a Covid infection in March 2020.
62-year-old from Sheffield spent a month in a coma and finally woke when nurses played him his own music.
He said performing again with his band Calico Fever ""meant everything"".
Mr Rodgers collapsed at home after having the stroke, which was caused by increased blood coagulation and clotting.
While in hospital he suffered three further minor strokes, a heart attack, pneumonia, septicaemia, blood clots on his lungs and had to be revived three times.
Mr Rodgers, from Frecheville, said: ""At one point I heard music in the distance and it got a bit louder, then I could hear some women talking and then I thought, 'they're my songs'.
""I opened my eyes and I remember a nurse saying, 'he's come back to us'.""
He was discharged after three months and since then has had to relearn to walk, talk, read and write, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said. 
Discussing relearning the guitar, he said: ""One day I picked it up and it was like going back to square one - I burst into tears because I thought I had lost music.
""But then I thought how lucky I am still to be here and how I owe it to all those people who didn't survive Covid to stick at it.""
Mr Rodgers, who has invited the medical staff who cared for him to the gig at Greystones pub in Sheffield on Saturday night, said he ""owed his life to the heroic efforts of NHS staff"".
""Saying thank you doesn't seem enough, I have a life again now,"" he added. 
""It will mean everything to perform again, it is me.""

sports	Tokyo Olympics: Laura and Jason Kenny win gold medals as son Albie watches from home	"They were already Great Britain's golden couple but Jason and Laura Kenny cemented their place in Olympic history with a gold medal each at Tokyo 2020.
Yet arguably their proudest moment came a year earlier.
Laura posted a video on Instagram in June 2020 of her running carefully alongside their then two-year-old son Albie as he successfully learned to ride a bike.external-link
re two of the strongest track cyclists in the world and they are also the best parents they can be to Albie, who will be four in August.
And, as for any parent trying to find the sweet spot between chasing their dreams and raising their child, it does not always come easily.
""I have never missed you more little man,"" Laura posted alongside an image of Albie watching her on television when she won team pursuit silver on Tuesday - the first time she has missed out on gold at the Olympics.
ree days later she was back on the top of the podium as Laura and Katie Archibald put on a cycling masterclass to dominate the women's madison to become the first British woman to win a gold medal at three Olympics.
On the final day of action, Jason was re-writing history himself as he won a seventh gold medal in a thrilling keirin race, becoming the most successful British Olympian of all time.
When it was announced that both husband and wife would represent GB in Tokyo, Laura said she ""massively underestimated how hard it would be to juggle both being a parent and us both being athletes"".external-link
As the 29-year-old was making her return to the sport after giving birth, an endeavour in which she was supported by fellow mum and Olympic champion Jess Ennis-Hill, she said she had to build her training around Albie rather than the other way round.
ge was made even more difficult by the coronavirus lockdown, meaning the pair could no longer rely on the support of grandparents to help care for Albie while they trained.
But the Kennys are ""tough"", says six-time Olympic champion Sir Chris Hoy.
ughness is what it took for Laura to return from a broken shoulder and arm sustained 18 months before the Games.
It is how Jason, 33, got back to being one of Britain's best after taking a year away from the sport post-Rio.
And toughness has surely been required to do all of that while raising a toddler.
""Albie came along and it just changed everything,"" Laura told the BBC before the Games.
""I just sort of relaxed a lot more. Every time I go home I just switch off. I always thought I wanted to be a young mum and I didn't want to let it get in the way of my career.
""I wanted to prove to myself that I could do both.""
Albie might make the logistics of finding time to train more complicated, but as both aimed to make their mark in the history books he has also provided vital motivation.
""I'd never been injured before, certainly not to that extent,"" she said of the injuries sustained in two major crashes in early 2020.
""It was the hardest couple of weeks in my career because I thought 'why am I doing this?' I do it all for Albie now. I've not sacrificed all this time with him for no reason.""
Jason now has nine medals in total, adding keirin gold and team sprint silver in Tokyo, to surpass Sir Bradley Wiggins, who also has eight in all.
According to data company Nielsen Gracenote, between them the married couple have won a third of all the gold medals claimed by Great Britain in the history of Olympic track cycling.
Sir Chris knows what it takes to achieve such greatness but he never tried to do it while being a parent, instead waiting until he had retired to have children.
""I've got no idea [what that's like],"" he said.
""It adds another dimension to the stress and difficulty that being a parent can bring.
""It balances it out with the joy you get from it and also the perspective. When you are lining up for an Olympic final, perspective is one of the things that can really help you cope with pressure.
""They complement each other. Jason's calmness can settle Laura when she might get a bit nervous or worry about things too much. She drags Jason up and picks his spirits up. They live for their sport and for their little boy Albie. 
""It just makes you so happy to see nice folk succeeding in life.""
Even their relationship has followed Olympic cycles. Laura took to Twitter to announce they were ""dating"" when they were caught kissing on camera at the London 2012 beach volleyball final.
got married after returning from Rio 2016 and Albie was born a year later.
r are now adding a Tokyo chapter to their Olympic story and both Jason and Hoy believe there will be much more to come from Laura at Paris 2024. And Jason hasn't 100% ruled out a fifth Games appearance.
Jason said before the Games his wife would ""trump"" any medal record he sets, adding it ""would be short-lived"".
""In two or three Games' time we will be looking back and Laura could have 10 gold medals,"" Hoy agreed. ""The best is possibly yet to come from Laura. I firmly expect Laura to be standing alone above Jason and above Bradley.""
And Laura may not even be the most successful Kenny, with Albie apparently well on the way in his cycling education.
""He's got a lot of expectation,"" joked Sir Chris.
""The poor lad has got a lot of pressure. He's got to take up something entirely different."""	/sport/olympics/58069122
business	Japanese yen touches 32-year low against US dollar	"Japanese yen touched a 32-year low against the US dollar after official figures showed that prices had risen faster than expected in America.
fell to 147.66 against the US dollar before regaining some ground.
Japanese Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said the government will take ""appropriate action"" against the currency's volatility.
In a rare move last month, Japan spent almost $20bn (£17.6bn) to prop up the country's struggling currency.
""We cannot tolerate excessive volatility in the currency market driven by speculative moves. We're watching currency moves with a strong sense of urgency,"" Mr Suzuki told reporters after attending a G7 finance meeting in Washington, DC.
Last month, Japan intervened in the global currency market to help support the weakening yen.
move came after the yen hit a fresh 24-year low against the dollar, marking the first time that Japanese authorities had intervened in the currency market since 1998.
However, analysts have warned that interventions like this would have little effect as long as Japan's interest rates remain far lower than those in the US.
Japanese currency has come under increasing pressure in recent months, mainly due to the very different approach taken by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in comparison with the US Federal Reserve.
On Thursday, official figures showed that consumer prices in the US rose more than expected last month in a sign that the inflation fight in the world's largest economy is far from over.
Inflation, the rate at which prices rise, was 8.2% in the 12 months to September, down from 8.3% in August.
Rising consumer prices in the US are being closely watched as the Federal Reserve's efforts to cool inflation push up the value of the dollar as well as global borrowing costs.
America's central bank has been aggressively raising its interest rates to combat soaring prices, which has made the dollar more attractive to investors. In contrast, the BOJ kept rates very low.
r's strength on the global financial markets is also having an impact on other major currencies around the world, including the pound and the euro.

sports	Erriyon Knighton on Tokyo, Oregon, Paris and beyond	"Erriyon Knighton's Twitter biography is short and to the point: ""Professional track athlete."" 
But there is a link below. A link that, via a search and scroll, leads to footage of an athlete who is neither on the track, nor professional.
with a wide shot of a high school American football pitch. 
Cheerleaders on the sidelines. A crowd of about 100 spectators in the bleachers. A Friday Night Lights scene. 
A slender, rangy figure in home-team red gathers a kick return on his 10-yard line. He looks up, spots a hole in the onrushing defence and darts through, evading a tangle of limbs. 
He hits halfway at a gallop. A final defender comes haring across, all pumping thighs and straining arms. But, it's in vain. The home team holler on the touchline as their man's easy, fluid stride eats up the field and carries him to the endzone.
It is just the start of a four-minute highlights reel,external-link posted in June 2020. 
And plenty were watching. Knighton's speed, 6ft 3in frame, sure hands and aggression had the country's best college football programmes - Alabama, Florida State, Tennessee and others - preparing offers. 
But, as the pandemic bit, the points switched. Knighton was sent down a different path.
""It could have gone differently if high school season was still going,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I probably would still have been playing football if I would've had that extra year.""
Instead, as school gridiron grew cold amid an enforced shutdown, a 16-year-old Knighton focused on his side hustle: track. 
He had been sprinting for a little over a year, after being encouraged to do so by his football coach as a way to sharpen his game as a wide receiver. 
""I only started running track in the ninth grade,"" Knighton remembered.
""Before then you could have asked me what 100m was and I wouldn't have known. I knew nothing about track.
""By the end of that year, I realised that I was kind of separated from the pack and faster than most people.""
And they have never caught up. 
Knighton, unable to compete locally because of lockdowns, took part in the nationwide Junior Olympics, just a couple of months after posting his latest football highlights video online. 
Running in 200m against other 16-year-olds, he stormed home in 20.33 seconds. As you watch the footage,external-link you can hear one voice from the stands swear in disbelief as the stagger unfurls and the extent of Knighton's yawning advantage is revealed.
Only Usain Bolt had ever gone faster at under-18 level. Only three Americans of any age - Noah Lyles, Kenny Bednarek and Josephus Lyles - went faster that year.
From then on, Knighton was destined to be wearing spikes, rather than shoulder pads.
But his decision to turn professional in January 2021, still aged just 16, was a big one. He could no longer compete for his school. He could no longer take up university scholarship offers. 
He was straying off a well-worn path to the top. There were murmurs that it was too much, too soon. Hubris fed by hype.
""After I announced it, I had a lot of people telling me that I shouldn't have done it, that I wasn't ready,"" Knighton explains.
I take it they are not saying that now? Knighton just smiles.
In June, the then 17-year-old became the youngest American man to make a United States Olympic athletics team in 57 years.
In Tokyo, five weeks later, he finished fourth in the 200m, one place outside the medals.
under-18 world record set by Bolt? Through the rounds and Olympic build-up, he beat it seven times over.
He's a bona-fide breakout star. This summer, another stage beckons, a home World Championships in Oregon. But if Knighton runs like he is in a hurry, he knows he has time on his side.
""In Tokyo, I was kinda upset that I had lost, but I just had to think about the big picture and the long run,"" added Knighton, who turned 18 in January.
""I get called young every day, I am going be 24 in 2028, that is in two more Olympics and still kind of young. I think about that all the time.
""That Tokyo experience is something no-one can ever take from you, I will always have that experience. I really try not to get caught up in the pressure.
""As I grow older I am going to get stronger and faster. I am not the perfect 200m runner, I am still learning as I run it.""
Knighton is still learning off the track as well. He is back in school, walking the corridors of Hillsborough High School in Tampa, Florida, brushing shoulders with current class-mates and former football team-mates. A little more money, a few free tracksuits, but still the same teenager.
""There were a lot of people wanting to take pictures with me at the start of the school year,"" he remembers. 
""I think I signed an autograph actually, it got that chaotic.
""It has calmed down now. Now everyone just walks past me just like, 'Hey, Erriyon'.
""In other schools in the area, people say to my class-mates 'you go to school with Erriyon', but for people in my school they see me every day, so it ain't nothing.""
won't be the only ones getting familiar with Knighton's fame over the next few years."	/sport/athletics/61045980
politics	Prince of Wales has no plans for investiture, Kensington Palace confirms	"Prince of Wales has no plans for an investiture, Kensington Palace has said.
William made his first visit on Wednesday to the Welsh Parliament since his father made him Prince of Wales.
King's decision triggered a debate about whether or not there should be a repeat of Charles' 1969 investiture in Caernarfon.
While there was support for that event at the time, it also faced protests.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said it ""easy to see"" why a different approach was being taken ""during tough times"".
Meanwhile the prince said he is supporting both England and Wales at the World Cup, following controversy over his support for the former.
Deputy presiding officer David Rees said William accepted a Welsh bucket hat during the visit.
William met the First Minister Mark Drakeford, Presiding Officer Elin Jones and party leaders.
He arrived at the Senedd by car and entered through a side-entrance for the meeting in Cardiff, which is free of the pomp or crowds of recent royal events in the capital.
Prince of Wales was given his title by the new King the day following the death of Queen Elizabeth II.
It was William's second official visit to the country as Prince of Wales, after he and the Princess of Wales visited Anglesey and Swansea in September.
role of Prince of Wales has faced criticism - the Plaid Cymru Senedd group said the title of has ""no formal place or responsibility within Welsh life"", following their meeting with the royal.
But the visit was welcomed by the Welsh Conservatives.
Kensington Palace said the meeting aimed to ""deepen his understand of the issues and opportunities of greatest importance to the Welsh people"".
BBC Wales was told that the prince understands he is at the start of a long period of association with Wales' political system, and was keen to express his desire to deepen the trust and respect of people of Wales over time.
He planned to tell them that there are no formal plans for an investiture ceremony, aware of the political controversy that surrounded the event in 1969.
Kensington Palace said an investiture is ""not on the table"".
ure ceremony for the then-Prince of Wales took place in Caernarfon Castle in 1969
On Wednesday the prince was given a brief tour of the Senedd building and debating chamber led by the Llywydd, Elin Jones.
He met politicians from the four parties represented in the Senedd - Welsh Labour, the Welsh Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Liberal Democrats.
William concluded his visit by meeting the Welsh Youth Parliament.
meeting follows controversy about his support for the English football team, ahead of the World Cup.
On Tuesday evening, Welsh actor Michael Sheen questioned whether William's role as Prince of Wales was appropriate given his support of the England football team.
Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru MS, said on Twitter: ""He's an Englishman, so of course he supports England,"" but added: ""I'm clear there shouldn't be a Prince of Wales. But this football thing must be embarrassing for him too. Just highlights the nonsense.""
After Elin Jones raised the World Cup group match between Wales and England, he said: ""I'm telling everyone I'm supporting both, definitely. I can't lose.
""I've supported England since I've been quite small, but I support Welsh rugby and that's my kind of way of doing it.
""I happily support Wales over England in the rugby.
""I've got to be able to play carefully with my affiliations because I worry otherwise if I suddenly drop England to support Wales then that doesn't look right for the sport either. So I can't do that.""
Prince Charles, as he was then, was 20 when he was crowned at the investiture ceremony at Caernarfon Castle.
While it had no formal constitutional role, the ceremony presented Charles with the symbols that marked him as Prince of Wales: the sword, coronet, ring, rod and mantle.
In addition to the 4000 guests present in the castle, 19 million saw it at home and another 500 million watched around the world.
was watched by a TV audience of millions. Street parties were held across the country, but it polarised opinion in Wales amid a backdrop of protests and bombings.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""I think it's a decision for him to make. He will have thought carefully about it. I always believed myself that taking 1969 as a template for Wales in 2022 would not be a reliable guide to the best way to proceed."" 
""In tough times, I think everybody who is in a position of making decisions about how public money is spent, and the sort of messages that it sends to the wider population, will be thinking hard about that and I think it's very easy to see why the prince himself, and those who advise him, will come to the conclusion that a different approach is the right one to take in 2022.""  
King Charles' decision to make William Prince of Wales triggered discussion among some politicians over whether an investiture would be suitable.
But in a Walesonline article, written in October, the presiding officer said investitures ""should be consigned"" to the 20th century.
Plaid Cymru MS Elin Jones, who is among those meeting William on Wednesday, wrote her republicanism remained ""unshaken"" following her involvement in the events marking the death of Queen Elizabeth at the Senedd and at St James' Palace, for the Accession Council.
In September Kensington Palace said there were no plans for Prince William to have an investiture ""anything like his father had"" as Prince of Wales.
Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price were among those who met William on Wednesday.
Mr Davies said it was a ""pleasure to welcome the Prince of Wales"".
He added: ""After the King and Queen's recent visit, it is fantastic to see the bonds between Wales and our Royal Family becoming stronger still. There is a huge amount of goodwill towards the Prince and Princess in Wales, and I know there will always be a warm welcome for them whenever they visit.
A spokesperson on behalf of the Plaid Cymru group said: ""The Plaid Cymru group have been clear that we believe the title of the ""Prince of Wales"" to be antiquated and out of touch with a modern, equal, and democratic Wales.""
""Furthermore, given the exacerbating cost of living crisis and the historical sensitives, an investiture should not take place in any circumstance - nor should any service that could be interpreted as a lesser form of an investiture,"" the group said.
It added: ""We look forward to seeing the Prince use the platform he has already, that isn't necessarily reliant on him being Prince of Wales, to promote good causes and positive change across Wales and the world including tackling child poverty, inequality, and the climate crisis.""
Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds, said: ""It was an honour to welcome His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to the Senedd this morning and I am extremely grateful for him taking the time to have a one-on-one meeting with me.
""It is very clear that His Royal Highness cares deeply about the people of Wales and it was fantastic to hear of his commitment to mental health causes, particularly his interest in mental health provisions for rural areas and farmers."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63635177

Grace Victory, 31, from High Wycombe, was put in a coma on Boxing Day 2020, just after giving birth to her son.
Dr Viv Sathianathan was the lead consultant on shift when she went into cardiac arrest three weeks later.
Ms Victory, who is also an author, said she felt privileged returning to Northwick Park Hospital in London to give a talk with him for trainee staff.
""It was an honour to talk with Dr Viv about the good and the bad from my 98-day stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to give advice on things that could be improved upon from a patient perspective,"" she said.
""Dr Viv said my heart stopped beating whilst I was laying on my front, which is literally a worst-case scenario, but he and a team of 10 nurses and doctors brought me back to life. And because of them I am here. Alive, breathing, living, thriving.""
Dr Sathianathan, clinical lead for intensive care medicine, said: ""We are all extremely pleased that Grace has made such an impressive recovery.
""We always strive to learn and improve and it was really informative to hear Grace talk to the team about the good and the bad during her time with us.""
Ms Victory, who was in a coma for three months, said the pair also spoke about the need for better psychological support for ICU patients and staff traumatised by the pandemic. She hopes to work on this idea with the charity Mind, for which she is an ambassador.
When the vlogger woke up in March 2021, she was finally able to meet her 10-week-old son Cyprus Sevyn for the first time. 
He was born by emergency C-section on Christmas Eve 2020, when Ms Victory was seven months pregnant, because she was so sick with coronavirus. 
Doctors have been amazed by her recovery, she said, after they initially only gave her a 5% chance of survival.
Ms Victory is now pregnant with her second child, a little girl, and is due to give birth next month.
""I'm now focusing on birth prep, relaxation and spending time with my bestie Cyprus Sevyn. I feel as if a chapter is closing and a new one is beginning and I could not be more excited,"" she added.

technology	Russian mercenary videos 'top 1bn views' on TikTok	"kTok is hosting dozens of videos that glorify violence by Russia's Wagner Group of mercenaries and they have been viewed more than a billion times, according to a new report.
Wagner has sent mercenaries into Ukraine in big numbers.
US-based NewsGuard, which focuses on online misinformation, says some of the videos appear to show the execution of a former Russian mercenary.
kTok has said it will act against any content violating its policies.
NewsGuard said it had identified 160 videos on the short-video platform that ""allude to, show, or glorify acts of violence"" by the mercenary group, founded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin.
Fourteen of those videos showed full or partial footage of the apparent killing of former Russian mercenary Yevgeny Nuzhin which saw high engagement within days of being uploaded last month, it said.
Analysts said one video of the murder was viewed at least 900,000 times before it was taken down. TikTok is owned by China-based firm ByteDance.
Nuzhin had been serving a jail term for murder but described how he had been recruited by Wagner and was then captured by the Ukrainian military. He told Ukrainian journalists he had switched sides voluntarily and denounced the mercenary group.
It is thought he was then part of a prisoner exchange and within days a gruesome video involving a sledgehammer was posted on a Wagner-linked channel on the Telegram messaging app.
NewsGuard found that TikTok's algorithm appeared to push users towards violent Wagner Group content. 
When an analyst searched for the term ""Wagner"", TikTok's search bar suggested searches for ""Wagner execution"" and ""Wagner sledgehammer"".  The same search in Russian resulted in the suggestions ""Wagner PMC"", ""Wagner sledgehammer"" and ""Wagner orchestra"". Wagner refers to its fighters as ""musicians"".
NewsGuard also found that videos could be found on TikTok showing another Wagner murder involving an army deserter in Syria in 2017 and that they had reached millions of users. 
group said it had also identified other music videos on the platform that advocated violence against Ukrainians, including calls to kill Ukrainians claiming they were ""Nazis"". 
Responding to the report, a TikTok spokesperson said there was ""no place for hateful or violent content on our platform"". Many of the videos identified by NewsGuard were no longer available on the platform by Thursday.
""Our Community Guidelines clearly outline that we do not allow people to use our platform to threaten or incite violence, or share attacks or slurs based on people's nationality or other protected characteristics. We will take action on content found to violate these policies,"" TikTok said. 
Wagner started out as a shadowy Russian mercenary group and in 2014 went to eastern Ukraine to help Russian proxy forces oust the Ukrainian military.
It has also been active in Syria and several African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. Last week the European Parliament called for it to be added to the EU's list of terrorist organisations.
Watch: Russian mercenary group recruits detainees
For years Yevgeny Prigozhin denied he had anything to do with Wagner, until September when he finally admitted founding the group.
Once know as ""Putin's chef"" because of his catering fortune, he appeared in recent videos recruiting inmates in Russian prisons for the war in Ukraine. 
Yevgeny Nuzhin's family knew nothing of his recruitment for the war, although before he died he told Ukrainian journalists he and the other prison recruits were merely ""cannon fodder""."	/news/world-europe-63820437
entertainment	Music therapy: Writing music brought the joy back after amputation	"m and Lucie, who started making music online during lockdown, now meet regularly in a studio
A man left with serious injuries after trying to take his life has said a music therapist helped give him a reason to live again.
m, 55, from Cardiff suffered brain injuries in 2020.
He is now partially sighted, his left arm was amputated just below his shoulder and he is now a full time wheelchair user.
While in a rehabilitation unit he was introduced to a music therapist and his life changed.
m said he was nervous about working with Lucie Phillips, from the music therapy charity Nordoff Robbins, but soon rediscovered his love of music.
""I didn't know what to think, but once I'd tried it out - and Lucie was so good with me, it was easy,"" he said.
""I was buzzing. Every week I'd be thinking, come on Wednesday, come on Wednesday, because I couldn't wait to do it again.
""It has brought a bit of joy, yeah because losing my arm, being a guitar player was horrendous, it's horrendous to be honest with you, I don't know how to describe it, but we move on we live on.""
Covid restrictions meant the two could not meet in person so they worked online to create music.
""It took a few weeks to write, little by little, but it was really good, Lucie was really patient with me,"" he added.
On Wednesday the pair recorded two songs written and composed by Tim called Computer Music and Pretty in Pink. 
He sings and uses a computer.
racks were recorded at the Shabbey Road recording studio in Caerphilly.
""There's no better feeling than creating music you know. I realised how much I missed it,"" said Tim.
Lucie remembers the first time she connected with Tim online.
""He was in a really difficult place when I first met him,"" she said.
""He was on a neuro rehabilitation ward and he'd been referred onto music therapy.
""He was feeling pretty low and they knew that he was a musician and wondered if music therapy might be able to help.
""As music therapists we're there to bring the wonders of music to people who aren't able to access music and use it for themselves when they're going through particular traumas in their lives.""
Lucie said Tim has  ""an amazingly eclectic taste in music"".
""We got to know each other through the songs Tim knows and loves from Roy Orbison, The Beatles, Black Sabbath and many more and many songs,"" she said.
""Then eventually we got onto song writing.
""We were using Zoom and were having to be incredibly patient with each other.
""Both being musicians we knew how frustrating it was not to be able to make music exactly at the same time. It's not easy, so hats off to Tim for persevering.""
week was the first time Tim and Lucie had met in person.
Lucie said Tim is very different to the man she first talked to in the rehabilitation unit.
""I think Tim is a more confident Tim now,"" she said. 
""I think Tim has processed what has happened to him and I think he has perhaps made some peace with that.
""It has been quite a nerve wracking journey meeting up and rehearsing and then recording… especially after not working together for such a long time, but Tim has absolutely risen to the challenge."""	/news/uk-wales-63487468

In the programme, which airs on BBC One on Tuesday 5 April at 21:00 BST, the 27-year-old five-time Paralympic Champion explores a new drug called vosoritide, which has been developed to treat children with achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism.
rug is already available in the US and the NHS has run trials for a potential roll-out in the United Kingdom.
Whilst many see the drug as a helpful breakthrough, Simmonds has concerns that it could potentially, ""eradicate dwarfism"". 
""Is it about changing who we are? I'm not a fan of that,"" she says early on in the film.
Simmonds was born with achondroplasia, which stunts growth in arms and legs. She has achieved massive sporting success, including eight Paralympic medals and 14 World Championship gold medals.
""If I wasn't a dwarf, I wouldn't have gone to the Paralympics and made a career as an athlete that way,"" she recently told BBC Sport, ""so I thought, 'gosh, if this drug was around when I was a kid, would I actually be who I am today?'""
Over the course of the documentary, Simmonds meets parents and children in the UK and US who are using vosoritide, in order to explore their motives and experiences. She also meets people with dwarfism who oppose its roll-out. 
After filming the documentary, Simmonds spoke to BBC Sport about how she felt after hearing from all of these different opinions.
""It's great that people have choice,"" she said. However, she added: ""If I had a child, because I knew what it's like having dwarfism, I wouldn't choose the drug.""
rity Restricted Growth Association UK defines achondroplasiaexternal-link as a rare genetic condition that causes poor bone growth, resulting in shortened limbs. The average height of someone with achondroplasia is around four feet.
Most children with achondroplasia are born to average size parents and many live healthy lives. There are some medical complications associated with achondroplasia, however.
As set out by to Great Ormond Street Hospitalexternal-link, infants with achondroplasia often have a curve in the lower spine, that may require a brace and some also develop bow legs, which can be treated with surgery. RGUK lists some more rare associated problems as hearing impairment, breathing problems in young children, hydrocephalus, spinal stenosis, leading to compression of nerves to the limbs.
Vosoritide is designed to improve growth in children with achondroplasia, who have open epiphyses (growth plates), meaning they have the potential to grow. Patients take a daily dose and have regular check-ups.
rug may cause serious side effects including a temporary decrease in blood pressure in some patients.
Last November, vosoritide was approved for use in the US, for children over the age of five and in the EU, for children over two.
A year of injections are reportedexternal-link to cost around $332,000 (£240,000).
During the film, Simmonds expresses concern that some parents of children with achondroplasia may want to use the drug irrespective of whether their child suffers any associated health problems.
Simmonds meets others in the dwarfism community who share those concerns, including American couple Joe Stramondo and Leah Smith.
""The assumption is that dwarfism is a problem that needs to be fixed,"" says Joe, in the film, adding, ""largely, the folks in the dwarfism community celebrate our differences"".
In order to get a better idea of why the drug is being trialled, Simmonds meets with Dr Melita Irving, who led the UK trials at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. Simmonds wants to know what the metrics of success are.
""The main thing that we measure is growth,"" Irving explains. ""If your bones are growing, that's because they're responding to the drug.""
As per the European Medicines Agencyexternal-link, from a sample of 121 children aged 5-17, those who received vosoritide grew about 1.57cm more during the one year of treatment than those receiving a placebo. The results also suggested that the improvement in growth is maintained while using the drug. The recommendation is to use injections until the patient is unlikely to grow any further.
As to fears about what implications this may have for the dwarfism community, Irving suggests that the aim is to deal with health complications.
""The intention with trialling this drug is not to eradicate dwarfism,"" she tells Simmonds. 
""Yes, dwarfism is an identity, but I also see achondroplasia as being linked with significant medical problems as well and so, one of the purposes of trialling this drug is to see if we can eradicate those complications, rather than eradicate dwarfism,"" she adds.
In 2019, the Restricted Growth Association UK published a statementexternal-link saying they would ""support any medical advancements that reduce the health complications of people with achondroplasia, avoid surgery, remove chronic pain and allow people to live every aspect of their lives to the fullest.""
However, they also added that they do not view increased height as ""an important outcome"" and that, ""if it is shown that this is the only benefit of vosoritide and there is no reduction in the health complications,"" they would no longer support the development of the drug.
During the film, Simmonds meets some of those involved in the NHS trial.
One of those children is 10-year-old Talia. Since taking the medication, she has grown six centimetres in 12 months, which is two centimetres more than the average for a child her age with dwarfism.
Her mother Rocana cites different reasons for participating, including that increased limb length allows her daughter to perform tasks like running or catching more easily. She also speaks about health problems that Talia faced earlier in life, including bowed legs, spinal problems and sleep apnoea.
In California, Simmonds meets the Haider family, who enrolled on the US trial of vosoritide and are strong advocates. Ahmin, 12, who has used the drug for three years, describes why he wants to continue.
""I'm satisfied with who I am, but I want to be better,"" he tells Simmonds. ""Being taller will give me opportunities, it will make my life easier, it would put me on a level playing field with more people,"" he adds.
majority of children with achondroplasia are born to average height parents and one of the delicate questions the film navigates is around those parents making decisions on behalf of their children.
""When they've been living every day as average height parents, they don't know what it's actually like to live with dwarfism,"" Simmonds said. 
However, she did also say that it had to be down to the legal guardians to make these calls.
For Simmonds, it is important to show that dwarfism is not something that needs to be ""cured"".
""As a dwarfism community, we have a role to play when it comes to parents who are nervous and unsure about what their child's life is going to be like. We need to show people that it's not all doom and gloom.""
Simmonds told BBC Sport that she has always felt happy with her own body. From a very young age, she has been involved in sport.
""I went to my first World Championships in 2006, when I was 12; the Beijing 2008 Olympics when I was 13; at London 2012, I was 17,"" she said. 
""I was at peak performance. My body was my tool - it was something that won me gold medals, so I never saw it in a negative way.""
However, she appreciates that not everyone has had such a happy experience.
One of the challenging scenes in the film is when Simmonds chats to her team-mate Will Perry, who also has achondroplasia. 
Perry has spoken publicly about the abuse he has received because of his dwarfism.
He admits that there are times when he wishes he was average height.
""I always get asked the question, 'if you could swap to be a normal person, would you?',"" he tells Simmonds.
""For me, it's 50/50. When we're out at the Paralympics, collecting amazing experiences, you go, 'no, not for the world', but then, when you get in the situations I've been campaigning for more recently, when you have to miss out on things like team sports such as rugby and football, it makes you think, 'actually I really wish I was normal'.""
Simmonds says that it's been eye-opening to speak to people with different experiences.
""I feel very lucky that I haven't really gone through that because of who I am.""
Vosoritide is awaiting National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) approval in the UK.
On the NICE websiteexternal-link, it says: ""The scoping exercise will be rescheduled to take place at a later date in 2023.""
When asked what she would like for people to take away from watching the film, Simmonds replied: ""I want people to see that, yes, society is different and that's amazing. Let's embrace that. Don't treat anyone differently - we're all human beings."""	/sport/swimming/60934176
health	NHS ambulance trust lost 12k hours to handover delays in one week	"An ambulance trust says more than 12,000 hours were lost in handover delays in one week.
South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust (SWASFT) said the figure from September was the ""highest level of resource hours lost in a single week"" in its history.
In 2020, the trust was losing less than 500 hours-a-week to handover delays.
SWASFT has now released plans which aim to ""significantly"" reduce delays as some waiting times begin to come down.
A spokesperson for the trust said its staff ""strive every day to give their best"" but its performance had not returned to pre-pandemic levels, partly due to handover delays at emergency departments. 
""We are working with our partners in the NHS and social care, to do all we can to improve the service that patients receive,"" they added.
report, published by the trust on Thursday, comes as thousands of ambulance workers across England and Wales are set to go on strike on Wednesday in a dispute about pay.
In 2020, SWASFT was able to deliver Category 2 mean response times of less than 30 minutes. 
Category 2 two calls are judged ""urgent"" and the mean response target is 18 minutes for all trusts.
But in the week commencing 26 September, the response times to these calls was almost two hours.
rust said there was a ""close correlation between ambulance hours lost and response times"".
SWASFT - which serves 5.5 million people - said there had been ""some improvements seen across October and November in comparison to the peak position seen at the end of September"".
In a bid to improve on this, the trust's commissioners have shared steps to reduce the weekly time lost to handover delays to around 2,600 hours a week by March 2023.
would ""still be significantly higher than historic levels, but a substantial improvement on the current position,"" the report said.
Areas that have already improved include Gloucestershire, which has seen mean Category 2 response times on certain days fall close to 25 minutes, compared to over an hour at their peak.
rust said it was ""placing more ambulances on the road than ever before"".
It is also recruiting for call takers for its emergency operation centres and is ""continuing to work hard on triage to reduce the number of patients we take to hospital,"" the trust said.

Singapore-based Lazada is one of South East Asia's biggest online retailers.

Royalists said the advert, which featured a woman in a wheelchair, mocked the younger sister of King Vajiralongkorn, Princess Chulabhorn, who uses a wheelchair as a result of Lupus, an autoimmune disease.
was ""offensive to the monarchy"" and ""caused disunity in Thai society,"" Thai army spokeswoman Colonel Sirichan Ngathong said in a statement.
""The army now has a policy to ban all army units and army-related activities from ordering merchandise from Lazada platform or delivering things from Lazada,"" she added.
's digital economy minister Chaiwut Thanakamanusorn told reporters that the government was considering legal action against the influencer and the advertising agency responsible for the video, as well as Lazada.
Under Thailand's lese-majeste law courts can hand down jail terms of up to 15 years for each offence of defaming, insulting or threatening King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the queen, their heir or regent.
Lazada, which is the South East Asian unit of Chinese online retail group Alibaba, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.
Earlier the company apologised for the ""emotional damage"" caused by the video and said it should have been more careful.
At least half a dozen businesses in Thailand, including some run by the palace, have also suspended use of Lazada because of the video, according to the Reuters news agency.

entertainment	David Tennant jealous of incoming Doctor Who star Ncuti Gatwa	"Former Doctor Who star David Tennant says he's ""a little bit jealous"" of the incoming Doctor Ncuti Gatwa ""starting on this exciting journey.""
""Ncuti is brilliant,"" adds Tennant, who played the Doctor between 2005-2010. ""He's a lovely, lovely man and he's full of beans and he's really talented. I mean he's like scary-talented.
""So I'm thrilled for every Doctor Who fan for what's to come and I include myself in that number.""
In May the BBC announced that Tennant himself would be reprising the role as part of the show's 60th anniversary celebrations next year. Details are shrouded in secrecy but we know that he will be reunited with Catherine Tate, who played his companion Donna Noble.
And Tennant now tells the BBC how the reunion came about. ""It all slightly happened a little bit by accident,"" he reveals. And, strange as it may sound, Covid played a huge role. 
He, Tate and Russell T Davies, who was in charge of the hit sci-fi series between 2005 and 2009, got involved in Doctor Who: Lockdown! a worldwide series of online ""watch-alongs"" of previous episodes designed to pass the time during the pandemic, ""when everyone was locked in their house"".
""That's where this all started"", explains Tennant. 
""At a certain time and day everyone would press play on a certain episode and some of the people who had been involved in those episodes were tweeting along.
""I don't tweet but my wife helped me,"" he laughs.
rogramme, which is almost 60 years old, was being filmed in central Bristol
Afterwards the three of them ""were just having a text exchange and Catherine said, 'wouldn't it be fun to do it again?'""
He adds: ""Russell said, 'We could do a one off, maybe they'd let us'.""
""We said, 'yeah that would be a laugh,' and then it all went quiet.""
But last year Davies announced he was back as Doctor Who's showrunner. And Tennant and Tate received a surprising offer.
""Suddenly Russell let us know that he was taking over the show again and he would be back fully in charge and would we come and play a little bit for him?"" says Tennant.
""So I don't know if we gave him the idea to take Doctor Who back but certainly we thought if he's doing it, we can't let these young people have all the fun.""
Before we see him back on screen in Doctor Who though, Tennant is returning to the stage, for the first time in five years.
Next month he will star in CP Taylor's play Good, about a decent, respectable German professor, with a Jewish best friend, who becomes a high-ranking Nazi.
""When you look back at the historical events like what happened in Germany in the 1930s, yes there were some monsters but mostly it was a nation full of people that were as complex and different and broadly decent as most of us are,"" says Tennant. ""So what happened?"" 
was first performed in 1981, and in a revival at the Royal Exchange in Manchester in 2011, the Guardian's Lyn Gardner highlighted ""the fatal lack of dramatic tension in a play in which quite a nice man slips under with no struggle at all"".
But Tennant says Good will ask the audience hard questions because ""it sort of plonks you in the middle of this awful context and it makes you wonder how you would cope yourself"".
""One likes to think one is the true, virtuous crusading type of person. One fears one is the one that lets things slide past. [For instance] we are staring down the barrel of a terrible climate emergency, what am I really doing about that?""
And staging the work, the award-winning director Dominic Cooke says he has been struck by how timeless the themes of the play are. 
""What this play does is it allows you to identify with this very sort of decent, funny, charming person and watch him make compromises,"" he says. ""We all want to think that we are going to be the person that will stand up and say no when something terrible happens. 
""But the truth is that very few of us actually do.""
Good is on at London's Harold Pinter Theatre from 5 October to 24 December."	/news/entertainment-arts-63073710
technology	Bradford duo behind £150k robberies snared by own trackers	"wo men who used high-tech trackers to monitor their victims' movements have been jailed for 15 years after being snared by their own devices.
Michael Crosdale, 28, and Robert Fairweather, 29, stole cash, jewellery and cars in raids in Leeds, Bradford, Wakefield and London in 2021.
Police described their scheme as a ""highly organised criminal conspiracy"".
men admitted conspiracy to commit burglary and were convicted of robbery following a trial at Leeds Crown Court.
goods worth more than £150,000 between May and September, with their scheme mainly targeting the owners of Chinese restaurants and takeaways.
racking devices fitted to their victims' vehicles enabled the pair to find out where they lived, allowing them to ransack their homes while they were out.
me was discovered after a tracker was recovered from one victim's vehicle.
Specialist investigators found the device was shown at both offenders' addresses and being deployed, regularly logged into, and recovered to be recharged as they targeted their victims.
In June, an 80-year-old man working as a customs agent was attacked and robbed outside his home in London after collecting a delivery of gold from Heathrow Airport.
Electronic evidence showed devices linked to Crosdale and Fairweather checking the tracker, and a vehicle linked to them was shown travelling to London at the time of the robbery and returning with the tracker.
Det Insp Vicky Vessey, said: ""This was a highly organised criminal conspiracy making use of tracking technology to target the victims.
""It was however that same technology, which they thought allowed them to keep their distance in the planning of these offences, that helped us to track them down.""
In addition to their 15-year jail term, Crosdale, of Manse Road, Burley-in-Wharfedale, and Fairweather, of Ranelagh Avenue, Ravenscliffe, Bradford, were also given a three-year consecutive sentence for drug and proceeds of crime offences.

technology	Robot boat maps Pacific underwater volcano	"Watch USV Maxlimer as it moves through waters around Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha’apai
A robot boat, controlled from the UK, has returned from an initial survey of the underwater Tongan volcano that erupted explosively back in January.
Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV) Maxlimer is part-way through mapping the opening, or caldera, of the underwater Hunga-Tonga Hunga-Ha'apai (HTHH) volcano. 
, developed by the British company Sea-Kit International, is surveying the volcano as part of the second phase of the Tonga Eruption Seabed Mapping Project (TESMaP), led by New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) and funded by the Nippon Foundation of Japan.
far has confirmed earlier reports of continuing volcanic activity from HTHH. A winch on the boat allows instruments to be deployed at depths, reaching 300m, in order to collect data from the entire water column.
12m-long Maxlimer may be in Tonga, but it is being remotely controlled from 16,000km away in the small coastal village of Tollesbury in Essex. Everything is done over satellite link.
In a dark control room in Sea-Kit's HQ, several large screens display live feed images from the 10 cameras on board Maxlimer. Operators, who work in shifts around the clock, watch on as real-time data gets beamed in from the South Pacific. 
""We can communicate with nearby vessels via radio as if we were on board""
Ashley Skett, director of operations at Sea-Kit, told BBC Radio 4's Inside Science programme that the operators can even communicate via radio with other vessels in the area, so much so that other boats wouldn't know that nobody was on board Maxlimer. 
""The boat has been designed from the ground up to be remotely controlled and remotely operated. So every switch, every function on the boat, every light, we can control from here.""
Robotic, remotely controlled boats are likely to be the future of maritime operations. When surveying a dangerous area such as the active HTHH volcano, remote control ensures no crew are put in harm's way.
re are also environmental benefits to USVs. As there is no onboard crew to support, the vessel can be much smaller, leading to reduced carbon dioxide emissions.
""We use 5% of the fuel that an equivalent manned vessel doing the same job that we're doing now would use,"" Ashley said.

sports	Six Nations 2022: What is the tournament's greatest match of all time?	"The Six Nations has delivered some of the most memorable matches in rugby history, but which was the greatest of them all?
Former British and Irish Lions captain Sam Warburton and ex-England scrum-half Danny Care debate and discuss that question on the latest episode of Six Nations Greatest.
x matches they came up with are ranked in reverse order below. Take a trip down memory lane, then rank them yourself at the bottom of this page.
What happened: Scotland led 24-14 with seven minutes to go in Cardiff, but a yellow card for replacement hooker Scott Lawson gave Wales hope. 
Leigh Halfpenny scored under the posts in the 77th minute and, after Scotland's Phil Godman was sin-binned, Stephen Jones took three points to level things at 24-24 with 15 seconds remaining. 
With the clock in red, Shane Williams found his way over to seal victory as the Cardiff crowd exploded with joy.
Warburton: It was my first Six Nations campaign and I just remember Wales being completely outplayed. We were chasing the game. 
I remember running back to the halfway line with Johnathan Thomas and I remember the noise was so loud celebrating and we were looking at each other talking, from about a metre away, I could see his mouth moving but could hear nothing. It was just a wall of noise. 
You hardly ever win in that dramatic fashion. At international level you get one of those every four or five years.
What happened: England travelled to Cardiff chasing a Grand Slam in the Championship decider. Wales, beaten at home by Ireland in round one, needed a winning margin of at least seven points to take the title. 
As England's discipline crumbled, Wales led by six at the break but two second-half tries from wing Alex Cuthbert helped the hosts to a record winning margin of 27 points.
Warburton: We did our anthem and it was out of this world. It was ridiculous. My single greatest moment, without a doubt. Emotionally that game drained us. 
People probably think that we had the biggest party of the year but I remember going back to the hotel, most of us sat down, had a bottle of beer and we literally just sat there for about three hours. It was just an enormous weight off our shoulders.
Care: We weren't prepared for what was to hit us in that caldron, that atmosphere we met. It was all Wales and we couldn't wrestle back any momentum. It was probably one of the harshest lessons I've learnt.
What happened: Wales went to Paris seeking a Grand Slam and, after a fast-scoring start for both sides, Josh Adams' try edged the visitors ahead. Victory seemed secure when they led by 10 points with three minutes remaining. 
France lost Paul Willemse to a red card, before two Welsh players were sin-binned and with the man advantage, Charles Ollivon made it across the try-line in the 77th minute. With the clock in red, Brice Dulin crossed to break Welsh hearts.
Warburton: That was agonising because it would have been Alun Wyn Jones' second Grand Slam as captain. It just shows how tough the Six Nations is… to win away from home and to win a Championship. Wales did everything they had to do for 79 minutes and 50 seconds but they lost in the end.
What happened: Ireland travelled to Wales seeking their first Grand Slam in 61 years. Wales led 6-0 at the break thanks to two Stephen Jones penalties, but Brian O'Driscoll's pick-and-go try and an incredible take by Tommy Bowe down the right wing put Ireland ahead. 
wo more penalties from Jones brought Wales to within two points and his 76th-minute drop-goal seemed to seal victory. But Ronan O'Gara scored a drop-goal of his own with two minutes remaining to make Irish rugby history.
Warburton: It was such a dramatic away win for Ireland that went right to the wire. For the two seconds it takes to score a drop-goal, the whole stadium holds their breath. Maybe not the most entertaining game from minute one to 80 but the significance it has for Ireland puts it in our top six.
What happened: England travelled to Dublin hoping for a first Grand Slam since 1995, having lost on the final weekend in several recent attempts. Ireland were looking to secure a first clean sweep since 1948. 
floodgates opened in the second half as Mike Tindall crossed, Will Greenwood made it over twice and Dan Luger scored. Jonny Wilkinson added 15 points from the boot - including two drop-goals - to complete a comprehensive win.
Warburton: England just did a demolition job and I remember watching it thinking that's what cut-throat, ruthless, world-class dominating teams do. Away at Ireland is one of the hardest away games you can have. To go there and deliver with such dominance sent a message to the rest of the world.
Care: It was such a unique game in that both teams were going for the Slam [on the final day]. It was all to play for.
What happened: A heavy defeat for Scotland seemed certain when England raced into a 31-point lead after half an hour. A second-half blitz by Scotland made it 31-31 and Sam Johnson looked to have sealed victory when he scored in the 76th minute. But George Ford crossed at the death to complete a remarkable draw.
Care: This for me was a crazy Six Nations game. For entertainment value, this is a 10 out of 10. Those moments when you need an ice-cool player - George Ford was the man. I don't think we'll see a game like that again.

sports	Battle of the Brits: Dan Evans beats Andy Murray as England win title	"Dan Evans beat Andy Murray as England clinched the Battle of the Brits title with an 8-4 win over Scotland.
British number two Evans won 6-4 3-6 10-8 against the three-time Grand Slam champion, after England team-mates Neal Skupski and Paul Jubb had earlier defeated Jamie Murray and Jonny O'Mara 6-4 5-7 10-6 in the preceding doubles.
Evans' victory put England 5-1 ahead and just one win away from the exhibition title in Aberdeen, before Paul Jubb stepped up to beat Scotland's Aidan McHugh 6-2 6-2.
Although a dead rubber, the Murray brothers then beat Evans and Skupski 6-3 6-4 in the final match of the tournament, and what could have been the last opportunity for Scottish fans to see them play together.
""I certainly hope it's not the case but we need to treat these moments like we might not get the opportunity again because we're getting on a bit, and you never know what's around the corner,"" said Andy Murray.
""It was amazing the whole two days, I'm very proud of Jamie for the event he put on.
""It meant a lot to both us the way all of the players showed up, competed well and went after it.""
Battle of the Brits was set up by Jamie Murray with the first edition held during the Covid-19 lockdown, without spectators, at a time when the regular tennis tours had been halted.
2021 edition was cancelled because of rising coronavirus cases at the time.
r's tournament has seen four men's singles and two men's doubles matches spread over two days at Aberdeen's P&J Arena.

health	Angela Rayner: Covid contract VIP lane was 'a scandal of epic proportions'	"""VIP lane"" to fast track companies recommended by MPs and peers for Covid contracts was a ""scandal of epic proportions"", Labour has said.
Deputy leader Angela Rayner said it ""allowed the shameful waste of taxpayers' money and inexcusable profiteering by Tory cronies"".
But Minister Nick Gibb said at the start of the pandemic ""we were desperate"" to get protective equipment.
Labour is trying to force ministers to publish correspondence about contracts.
At a Commons debate later, the party will present a motion to MPs calling for the release of documents and advice relating to government contracts awarded to one company, PPE Medpro. 
government has faced questions over the company's alleged links to Conservative peer Michelle Mone. 
If Labour's motion passes then the government would have to publish the documents, although they may argue they can be redacted for legal reasons or because of commercial sensitivity. 
Conservative MPs are expected to abstain from the vote, which would allow the motion to pass. 
f the so-called VIP lane was to treat offers of personal protective equipment (PPE) with greater urgency if they came from a supplier recommended by ministers, government officials or MPs and peers from any party. 
Schools Minister Mr Gibb said the government saved ""hundreds of thousands of lives"" by procuring PPE at speed at the beginning of the pandemic. 
""The government had to do everything it could to persuade manufacturers to shift their production,"" he told BBC Breakfast. 
However, Ms Rayner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't accept that cronyism and this level of scandal is to do with a panic.""
Between May and June 2020, PPE Medpro was awarded two government contracts worth £203m to supply masks and medical gowns.
Unusually, the company was only a few weeks old when it signed the first of these agreements. 
In December 2020, BBC News reported that millions of medical gowns the firm supplied, worth £122m, had never been used. 
PPE Medpro said at the time that it had delivered 100% of the contract to the terms specified and that it had supplied equipment ""fully in accordance with the agreed contract, which included clear terms as to technical specification and performance criteria of the products"".
Department of Health said: ""Due diligence was carried out on all companies that were referred to the department and every company was subjected to the same checks.""
rtment is currently in mediation with PPE Medpro over what it has described as an ""underperforming contract"" and said it was unable to comment on specifics. 
Glasgow-born businesswoman Baroness Mone, who joined the House of Lords in 2015, is being investigated by the Lords commissioner for standards over her ""alleged involvement"" in procuring contracts for the company.
However, the commissioner says he is unable to finalise or publish his report because ""the matter is under investigation by the police or another agency as part of a criminal investigation"".
Properties linked to the company have previously been searched by the National Crime Agency.
Emails released under Freedom of Information laws show Baroness Mone referring the company to a government minister during the pandemic.
Last month, Ms Rayner accused the government of a ""total failure of due diligence"" and a ""conflict of interest"" in awarding the contracts to PPE Medpro.
She was responding to an investigation in the Guardian based on leaked documents that alleged Baroness Mone had financially benefited from the company.
She told MPs it appeared ""tens of millions of pounds"" from the money awarded to the company ""ended up in offshore accounts connected to the individuals involved"". 
Baroness Mone has not responded to requests for comment. 
However, asked in December 2020 about reports she was linked to the company, her lawyers told BBC News she ""had no role or function in PPE Medpro, nor in the process by which contracts were awarded to PPE Medpro"".
Separately, Matt Hancock has accused Baroness Mone of being aggressive and threatening when trying to secure another government contract for Covid tests. 
In his book, Pandemic Diaries, Mr Hancock claimed she had demanded ""urgent help"" to secure contracts in an email in June 2021, when he was health secretary. 
Mr Hancock has not named the firm but the Daily Mail reported it was not PPE Medpro.
