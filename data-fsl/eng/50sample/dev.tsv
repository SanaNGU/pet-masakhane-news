entertainment	Splinter Cell: Audio drama, gaming's next frontier?	"Whether it's World of Warcraft, Uncharted or the upcoming Super Mario movie - games characters have been all over our cinemas in recent years.
Last of Us is coming to television screens, where shows based on Resident Evil and Halo have found audiences.
Now, BBC Radio 4 is getting in on the act.
Sam Fisher, leading man from the Splinter Cell game series, can call the radio station home, thanks to a first-of-its-kind adaptation that producers say no-one had thought possible.
Radio 1 film critic Ali Plumb says that with so much competition for audiences these days it's no surprise that commissioners are giving the green-light to projects with a ""built-in audience"".
He argues that we live in a world that is dominated by content: ""From podcasts to music, TV, movies, games and audiobooks - frankly its tricky for anyone to cut through the noise.
""The art of finding intellectual property, using the built-in fan base of that property and engaging with them in something you want to say about the world is the trick that many creative people are trying to do.""
Splinter Cell: Firewall is an eight part dramatisation of a novel based on the famous video game franchise. Sam Fisher, the series' main protagonist, is a covert special agent who excels at sneaking around military bases at night, silently killing terrorist guards and generally saving the world.
Bringing the gaming revolution to audio drama makes perfect sense to actor Andonis Anthony, who plays Sam in the Radio 4 drama, which is also available on BBC Sounds. He argues that with more people turning to ""non-music audio"", it's a good time for BBC radio to tell stories that offer a ""cinematic experience"".
""Given the rise in podcasts, and audiobooks being so popular - more and more people are getting used to listening to audio as a story experience. Everyone's going out and about with their air pods on these days and listening in a different way to before."" 
A paramilitary secret agent is a bit of a change for Anthony who's perhaps better known to Radio 4 listeners as Russ Jones, an art gallery curator living in Ambridge. ""It's the polar opposite of what I'm doing in the Archers,"" he laughs. 
Other platforms have adapted video games into audio dramas recently, with stories from franchises like Assassin's Creed and Bioshock being available to listen to, but this is the first time the BBC has got involved. 
For a few years now the the organisation has been trying to appeal to new and younger audiences - on television, online and radio. 
Sebastian Baczkiewicz, who adapted the Firewall story for Radio 4 and BBC Sounds, hopes that just because this is a story based on a gaming franchise, it won't be pigeonholed as something for younger listeners only: ""Trying to reach new audiences is always part of what we do and hopefully this will find an audience.
""But I don't know if they'll be younger. People in their 50s, 60s and 70s play - gaming is a massive global phenomenon.""
Video games are inherently a visual medium - which is why high-profile crossovers have focused in the main on film and television, and Baczkiewicz admits the adaptation was ""an extraordinary challenge"", but one he was excited about. 
""The genius of this is that no-one actually thought it was possible, but I always think of anything in radio in a very visual way. I'm not sitting here thinking how it will sound, but rather what does it look like, what's happening in the scene and what are people doing.
""With access to all the sound effects from the game we were able to bed the drama into the world of the game - and show fans that we're not leaving the game behind, instead we're slap bang in the middle of the action.""
While plenty of executives and commissioners have been happy to back movie and television gaming crossovers in recent years, not all of them have been box office successes - and many have been critical failures.
Ali Plumb believes there are clear lessons to be learned from these failed experiments: ""Embracing what makes the originals so beloved but also doing what makes sense for the new medium - finding this balance is the key to making a success of these crossover projects, whether it's TV, film or audio drama.""
He argues that projects aimed at children - like Sonic and Angry Birds - have found the greatest success in doing this: ""Maybe because, without being too rude, they don't have to pass such a high critical bar to be successful in their own terms. As long as they're putting smiles on faces, then they're doing their job nicely.""
Splinter Cell has a more mature fan base than those examples - so the job of making a success of this adaptation may be a little harder.
m behind it say paying respect to the source material is the key, Andonis Anthony explaining it was a major focus for everybody involved, ""from the production team, from writers to the performers, all of the cast"".
Sebastian Baczkiewicz added: ""There's no winking as it were, there's no 'this is all a bit crazy, isn't it?!' This is the world we are in and we are being true to it. We were really keen to make sure we maintained that throughout.
""The audiences of these games are passionate and why wouldn't you treat them and the story with respect.""

politics	Stephen Flynn: Who is the new SNP Westminster leader?	"Aberdeen South MP Stephen Flynn is set to face his first Prime Minister's Questions less than 24 hours after being elected the SNP's new Westminster leader.
Here is what we know about the 34-year-old and what colleagues expect of him.
Mr Flynn was born in Dundee and raised in the city and in nearby Brechin.
He studied politics at Dundee University before moving to Aberdeen - although he still travels back down the A90 to support Dundee United.
His hip gave way when he was a teenager, and he spent 17 years in ""constant pain"" and facing a ""daily physical and mental battle"" until eventually having replacement surgery in September 2020.
After marrying his wife in 2014, he was elected to Aberdeen City Council in a by-election the following year, and served as the SNP's group leader from 2016 until he became an MP in 2019.
He took Aberdeen South from the Conservatives - a seat which has bounced between Labour, the SNP and Tories at the last four elections.
Following his election as Westminster leader, Nicola Sturgeon congratulated both Flynn and Paisley and Renfrewshire South MP Mhairi Black, who was elected deputy leader, calling them a ""truly formidable team"".
SNP MP Stewart Hosie echoed that sentiment, telling the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""One thing you will see from Stephen is a different tone - perhaps more pointed, snappier, more vibrant. 
""I think he will bring a great deal to the table and a great deal to the independence cause as he holds the government to account.
""Stephen has rare gift of being able to communicate difficult things in a really effective way and I'm looking forward to seeing him deploy that particularly in PMQs today.""
Stephen Flynn says he will push the impact of the cost of living and Scotland's right to choose its future
Mr Flynn's maiden speech in the Commons underlines why colleagues hope he will be a punchy presence as leader.
He warned Conservative members that ""we will not forget, and we will not forgive this government"".
He added: ""Scotland rejects your austerity and Scotland rejects your Brexit, just as Scotland rejected your prime minister.""
Mr Flynn became a prominent member of the so-called Tuesday Club of male SNP MPs who regularly meet for five-a-side football, beer and curry nights.
gas industry is at the heart of his patch, and he initially argued against the idea of a windfall tax on the profits of big energy firms - something later embraced enthusiastically by the SNP.
In February, he told MPs: ""The last time the UK government implemented a windfall tax, investment in the North Sea oil and gas sector plummeted. 
""It fell off a cliff - in fact it has never got back to where it was. If that happens again, my constituents will lose their jobs.""
Mr Flynn has been linked to the leadership role for some time, with newspaper reports claiming he was set to oust Ian Blackford surfacing weeks before the Skye MP decided not to stand again.
However, SNP leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that the change is ""not a coup"". "	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63886702

business	Cancelled flights: Traveller stuck abroad without medication	"A man has been left stranded in Amsterdam without lifesaving medication for three days  after flights were cancelled across Europe.
Russ Montlake-Mees, 63, had been due to fly home on 4 June but said he was ""thrown under the bus"" by EasyJet which cancelled two flights at short notice.  
usands of travellers are thought to be stuck abroad after flight cancellations over the Jubilee weekend.
EasyJet said it was ""sorry that these passengers' flights were cancelled"".
Mr Montlake-Mees, who is diabetic and takes medication related to a triple heart-bypass, travelled to Amsterdam on 31 May.
He said he only took enough medication and insulin to last the length of his five-day trip.
""I was not expecting any problems like this at all.""
After paying for a hotel, Mr Montlake-Mees booked a flight for Monday only for it to be cancelled as he made his way to the airport. 
He said: ""We've found ourselves thrown under the bus by EasyJet.
""They were not contactable because they've been cancelling an awful lot of other flights during the day.
""We ended up going back into Amsterdam itself and booking a hotel at our own expense.""
Mr Montlake-Mees estimates he has spent over £1,000 on accommodation, travel and food while stuck in Amsterdam.
EasyJet did pay for one night's accommodation in a hotel that was ""like a converted prison"", Mr Montlake-Mees said. 
Up to two million people were scheduled to fly to and from the UK over the bank holiday weekend.
According to aviation data firm Cirium, 305 flights departing the UK were cancelled out of a total of 10,662 scheduled flights over the Jubilee weekend. 
Several airlines cancelled flights, with EasyJet scrapping a further 37 on Monday.
In a statement EasyJet said: ""We notified customers directly of their options to rebook or receive a refund, and are providing hotel accommodation and meals when required."""	/news/uk-england-london-61721720
politics	Cost of Living: Asylum seekers left without basics to live on - charity	"Harriet Protheroe-Soltani said the allowance provided by the UK government should be supplemented
Rising prices have driven some asylum seekers to destitution, a charity has warned.
Welsh Refugee Council (WRC) has called for asylum seekers to be allowed to work in order to increase their income.
It said it was having to support more people with its hardship fund, as well as clothes and food donations.
Home Office said it provided accommodation and a weekly allowance to support asylum seekers. 
People seeking asylum are given somewhere to live, and a weekly allowance of £45 to cover food, essential items and travel.
In Wales, refugees are given free travel on public transport.
WRC provides help for asylum seekers in accessing support, including guidance on applying for asylum, and finding legal representation, as well as more practical help in building their lives in Wales, after escaping conflict zones, such as Ukraine, or human rights abuses in north Africa. 
Harriet Protheroe-Soltani, from the WRC, said the allowance provided by the UK government should be supplemented, by allowing asylum seekers to work as they wait to discover the outcome of their claim. 
""Asylum seekers aren't allowed to work in the UK, so that is a very limited pool of money that they've got to survive off, and they can't really expand that pool of money,"" she said. 
""From that £45, asylum seekers are expected to spend money on things like transport, food, essential toiletries, all of the day to say costs. 
""We've people from our play project who come in, they are mothers, and they can't afford to get their children uniforms,"" she said.
Ms Protheroe-Soltani added it was very difficult, with people falling into destitution and not surviving.
Frezgi Meles, fled war in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, and came to Cardiff. 
""There is a genocide in Tigray, a lot of people are killed, women are raped, a lot of infrastructure is getting destroyed,"" he said. 
""We cannot live in our country because of the dictators.""
Fighting in the region led to the destruction of homes, school and hospitals.
Human Rights Watch has estimated more than two million people in Tigray have been forced to leave their homes. 
Now living in Cardiff, the 38-year-old volunteers for the Red Cross and the Welsh Refugee Council and said he has found it difficult to afford the basics on his £45 allowance, and said he would rather work. 
""It would be good if we could get work permits, so that we could get jobs.""
Ms Protheroe-Soltani said asylum seekers were in a ""no man's land between having this really small amount of money, and not being able to work"".
She added a lot of asylum seekers would ""love to work"".
""Remember the HGV drivers crisis? There were many of our clients that would've been willing and able to go and fill that shortage, but they're unable to, so they're in a really difficult position,"" she said. 
Home Office said: ""The Nationality and Borders Act will fix the broken asylum system, by processing application more quickly, and focusing on those genuinely fleeing persecution.
""For asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute, we provide accommodation, and a weekly allowance for food, clothing, transport and sundries.
""The Home Office ensures all spending is carefully scrutinised to make sure that every pound of taxpayers' money is spent in the most effective way, and we review the allowance rate annually."" "	/news/uk-wales-64068912

technology	Guardian newspaper hit by suspected ransomware attack	"Guardian newspaper has come under a suspected ransomware attack.
It said there had been a ""serious incident"" affecting its IT systems in the last 24 hours, with disruption to ""behind the scenes services"".
mpany said it was continuing to publish globally to its website - one of the most visited news sites in the world - and was ""confident"" it could still print the physical paper.
Staff have been told not to go into the office and to work from home.
In a statement, the Guardian said: ""Our technology teams have been working to deal with all aspects of this incident, with the vast majority of our staff able to work from home as we did during the pandemic.
""We believe this to be a ransomware attack, but are continuing to consider all possibilities.""
Ransomware is malicious software used by hackers - and often sent via attachments in emails - to gain access to an organisation's or individual's computer systems.
riminals then find and encrypt important or sensitive files - and demand a ransom for them to be unlocked.
Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work?
A huge range of targets - from schools and hospitals to government agencies and media organisations - have fallen victim to ransomware, with research indicating hackers are paid in the majority of cases, especially in the UK.
According to the Press Gazette, the Guardian is the ninth most-read news site in the world, with almost 390 million visits in November.
In its own reporting of the incident, the Guardian said online publishing was ""largely unaffected"".
It said Guardian Media Group chief executive Anna Bateson and editor-in-chief Katharine Viner had sent a message to the company's workforce.
""Thank you to everyone working hard throughout this incident to keep us publishing,"" they said.
""We will continue to keep our staff and anyone else affected informed. 
""With a few key exceptions, we would like everyone to work from home for the remainder of the week unless we notify you otherwise.""
Jake Moore, global cyber-security adviser at security software company ESET, said the Guardian being targeted was not a surprise.
""News organisations have become a regular target for cyber-attacks this year, and these attacks often have even more damaging effects on the companies targeted,"" he said.
""Ransomware can often bring all departments to a standstill, so it is fortunate that despite this attack the organisation will still see some key areas working as usual."" "	/news/technology-64056300
business	Cost of living: Walmart issues profit warning as price rises hit	"US retail giant Walmart has warned over its profits for the second time since May, as the soaring cost of food and fuel hits customer spending.
mpany says it now expects profits to fall by as much as 13% this year.
One expert told the BBC that Walmart's unscheduled announcement ""signals a warning bell for the retail sector"".
firm's stock market value slumped almost 10% in after-hours trade in New York, while shares in rival retailers Amazon and Target also fell sharply.
Walmart had previously said that it expected its full-year profit to fall by just 1% this year.
""The increasing levels of food and fuel inflation are affecting how customers spend,"" its chief executive Doug McMillon said in a statement on Monday after US markets closed.
He added that the retailer planned to cut the prices of clothing as it was ""anticipating more pressure on general merchandise in the back half"" of this year.
As food and fuel prices rise, shoppers are having to spend more of their income on essentials and have cut back on other spending, Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at data analytics firm GlobalData, told the BBC.
Mr Saunders said Walmart's warning suggests that many other retailers were also feeling the squeeze.
""Walmart has buying power like few others. That helps it mitigate against some inflation, but as today's announcement shows, even the mightiest are not immune to rising costs,"" he said.
Also on Monday, online retail giant Amazon raised the price of its Prime service for UK customers for the first time since 2014 because of ""increased inflation and operating costs"". Prime offers unlimited delivery of products, and entertainment streaming services.
Prices in the US and UK are rising at their fastest rate in four decades, driven by higher petrol and food costs.
Ukraine war and supply chain issues caused by the pandemic have driven up everyday costs for households and businesses.
In its last earnings announcement in May, Walmart said it had more than $60bn (£49.7bn) worth of stock and pledged ""aggressive"" price cuts on some items.
mpany also trimmed its profit outlook for the first time. That led to its shares suffering their biggest one-day drop since 1987.
Walmart is scheduled to publish its second quarter earnings on 16 August.

entertainment	Taylor Swift: Midnights praised by critics despite lack of radio hits	"r Swift's new album has been met with rave reviews from critics, although some said its subdued tone means it lacks potential hit singles.
Midnights, the singer's 10th original studio album, was awarded five stars by both the Guardian and the Independent.
Guardian said Midnights is a ""cool, collected and mature"" record which is ""packed with fantastic songs"".
But some criticised the lack of radio hits, with the Evening Standard noting there is ""not a smash hit in sight"".
Swift is currently re-recording her early records due to a dispute with music mogul Scooter Braun, but has paused that process to release a new album of original material. 
Midnights is the 32-year-old's first original album in two years and sees her return to a more mainstream sound than the somewhat muted, acoustic tone of her previous two albums.
Her new record retains some of the folksy charm of sister albums Folklore and Evermore, both released in 2020 during the pandemic. But it also sees her re-engage her pop sensibilities, with lyrics that explore more personal subject matters.
Some songs offer fans further insight into the star's normally low-key relationship with her boyfriend, English actor Joe Alwyn.
Swift previously described the album as ""stories of 13 sleepless nights, scattered throughout my life"". 
In a five-star review, the Guardian's Alexis Petridis said Midnights ""delivers her firmly from what she called the 'folklorian woods' of her last two albums back to electronic pop"". 
""There are filtered synth tones, swoops of dubstep-influenced bass, trap and house-inspired beats and effects that warp her voice to a point of androgyny,"" he noted. 
""Confidence is the thing that binds Midnights together. There's a sure-footedness about Swift's songwriting, filled with subtle, brilliant touches.""
Independent's Helen Brown also awarded five stars, writing: ""Over a series of murky electronic grooves (mostly co-written with Jack Antonoff), the pop star unpacks her darkest dreams, deepest doubts and cruellest thoughts. All the while she keeps things just cryptic enough to keep the tension crackling and the speculation buzzing.
""The subtle melodies of Midnights take time to sink their claws in,"" she added. ""But Swift's feline vocal stealth and assured lyrical control ensure she keeps your attention. Turn the lights off and let these songs prowl around you. Just don't expect their meanings to settle too biddably into your lap. Swift's always as elusive as she is allusive.""
However, the Evening Standard's David Smyth was significantly less enthusiastic, awarding the album just two stars.
""It's hard to spot anything that sounds like a smash hit on Swift's third muted collection in a row,"" he wrote.
""While the style is a change from Folklore and Evermore, Swift is never at the ball when the clock strikes 12. On the twinkly Bejeweled she announces that she's 'going out tonight', but the beats remain sleepy and sluggish.
""The brighter Karma, presumably another dig at Braun, is the only song that feels like it could be a highlight when she eventually returns to the stage. Otherwise Midnights sounds ready for bed.""
But Rolling Stone's Brittany Spanos argued that a subtle return to form has resulted in an improved quality of songwriting from the star.
""As Swift has returned to her archive for to undertake the project of re-recording her previous albums, it's clear slipping back into her past self has unlocked something brilliant and fresh in her songwriting,"" she wrote. 
""Midnights may come as a surprise to the most newly turned fans of her music, those who only learned to like her songwriting when it came in the traditionally respectable Folklore/Evermore package.""
Swift is gearing up for a busy few months. She is hoping to be nominated for an Oscar in January, either for her short film All Too Well, or in the best original song category for her track Carolina, taken from Where The Crawdads Sing 
But Midnights will be her main focus for the next few months, with fans anticipating the announcement of a world tour in support of its release.
In a four-star review, the Times' Will Hodgkinson wrote: ""Swift has said she intended Midnights as a concept piece based on 13 nights of troubled sleep, and these variously minimal, eerie, heartfelt and intense songs do have a crepuscular quality that is out of keeping with her usual cheery brightness. 
""Sometimes, as on Labyrinth, the modish vocal treatments are off-putting, but in the main Midnights appeals because, for all its modern touches, it is essentially an old-fashioned singer-songwriter album about human weakness.""
NME's Hannah Mylrea wrote: ""After a foray into a different sonic world, on Swift's return to pure pop she still shimmers.
""She spins these new stories through sleek synth-pop, in common with [previous albums] 1989 or Lover, but the razor-sharp production of these albums is more subtle this time around.""
graph's Neil McCormick praised the album's ""sensuous electro-digital sound"" in his four-star review for the Telegraph, but also highlighted the lack of radio hits. 
""Yet despite the Prince-like falsetto funkiness of opening love song Lavender Haze and glib strut of Bejeweled (""When I walk in a room, I can still make the whole place shimmer"") there are no obvious chart-smashing bangers. 
""It is almost as if she has become too mature for the brand of meme-friendly, earworm pop with which she made her name."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63341633

It arguably offered light relief to audiences weary of hearing about war in Ukraine, Covid, the heatwave and politics.

Mrs Vardy has always denied this, and filed legal proceedings against Mrs Rooney - but in July, Mrs Justice Steyn ruled Mrs Rooney's accusation was ""substantially true"". 
Mrs Rooney is expected to receive an estimated £1.5m from Mrs Vardy towards legal costs.
Hennessy says her play, Vardy v Rooney: The Wagatha Christie Trial, captures a moment in time - exploring what is private and what public.
""This case couldn't have happened 10 years ago, and it probably won't happen in 10 years, because media law is catching up with how we operate on social media every day,"" she says.
""The play questions what we ask of our public figures, and whether we believe they should behave with integrity - which is fair enough if you're a politician, somebody very high up. 
""But it becomes murkier when you're a social-media influencer, or you're 'fame adjacent', but you have social media.
""When you start to monetise public trust, and get money for your Instagram posts, we sort of have a right to know whether we can trust you or not.""
Before putting pen to paper, Hennessy spent a fortnight wading through 1,200 pages of transcripts, bought by the play's producers. 
wasn't a hardship though - she had already been ""glued to the case"", following it via WhatsApp groups and Twitter and taking particular delight at some of the memes.
""I come from soap, so I'm used to very, very tight deadlines, working under extreme pressure and finding the story,"" Hennessy says.
""It suited my skill set - but it's been a ride.""
She also consulted people with the necessary legal knowledge, ""to make sure I nailed it"".
f verbatim theatre - when its characters speak, they use real-life words.  
Director Lisa Spirling, who approached Hennessy to write the play, knew the format could work.
""Nicholas Kent did a huge amount of plays based on trials [and inquiries] at London's Tricycle Theatre, so we knew it had been done before"", she says.
His work includes plays on the Grenfell Tower fire, Stephen Lawrence's murder and Bloody Sunday.
Both women are clear about what struck them about the Vardy-Rooney trial - and what they chose to avoid.
Hennessy stresses she is not trying to belittle the women, arguably best-known for being footballers' wives.
""You could think we're punching down at people who don't understand the legal system, we're going to laugh at them,"" she says. 
""That's not what this play is about.""
Instead, what really came across reading the transcripts was ""they both are incredibly intelligent women, who navigate a legal system - most of us would be very confused"", Hennessy says.
""They're so self-possessed, they're confident, they handle it,"" she says.
Spirling admits being initially ""quite snobby"" about the case, until the play's producer, London Theatre Society president Eleanor Lloyd, persuaded her to think again and explore the issues raised. 
She agreed, and realised it had huge potential as a play. And she is not alone in this - Channel 4 is also making a docudrama about the case.
""I was asking, 'Are we pulling down two working-class women, or two women in a situation who happen to be very rich?"" Spirling says, on how the women could be portrayed. 
But her ""hackles went up"" at the ""patriarchy of everyone calling them Wags the whole time"".
Former sports journalist Alison Kervin, who landed a three-book deal in the 2000s to write novels starring Wags, told the Times recently: ""I hate the term Wag.
""The whole 'Wag' culture infantilised women,"" she said. ""They were seen as the pretty hangers-on.
""Girls no longer want to be just wives or girlfriends. As we've seen this summer, women are able to play football too - and actually win.""
Spirling also found a connection with the case.
""I'm from Lancashire originally, and many of my (male) friends are professional footballers,"" she says. ""A bizarre amount were from my local school.
""To see those boys go on that journey and have too much money, be too famous too young, and what that does to you - to be living that life, as those guys have for 20 years -the exhaustion of that, and how you maintain it, and for the women alongside it. 
""So I just I felt like I knew that world.""
And after a ""deep dive into what people were fighting for"" in the court case, she concluded ""it's reputation and control of their narrative... Instagram is a way of individuals taking back control"".
One voice missing from the trial was that of Caroline Watt, Mrs Vardy's friend and agent.
A consultant forensic psychiatrist produced a report concluding she was unfit to give oral evidence.
But she is featured in the play.
""What Liv has done extraordinarily well is to find a way to bring Caroline into the room,"" Spirling says. 
""So you have a sense of her, partly because of so many WhatsApp messages, but also in the presence of that person. 
""She's the one we're not talking about, where you go, 'That is someone that's lost their job, who wasn't in the public eye, who clearly this has been incredibly distressing for, and significant and troubling... it feels really important."" 
Hennessey also includes football pundits on stage, who comment on the action in court, plus action replays. 
She won't divulge which memorable moments from the court case are featured but says: ""I don't think people will be disappointed.""
roduction started out as a one-night-only performance but has been extended after demand for tickets.
""We want to give people a great night out,"" Spirling says. ""The world is pretty tough right now. 
""This play absolutely has conversations about economics and fame and celebrity - and it will give people a bit of escapism.""

health	New South Wales scraps tens of thousands of Covid fines	"More than 33,000 Covid fines will be withdrawn or refunded in Australia's most populous state after a court deemed them invalid.
An Australian legal advocacy group challenged the pandemic-era fines on the basis they were ""too vague"".
""fail to comply"" fines were issued for a range of alleged offences - from carpooling to attending a public gathering. 
ranged from $1,000 (£559) to $3,000 (£1,677). 
Ultimately, government lawyers conceded the fines did not meet legal requirements in the New South Wales Supreme Court. Shortly after the decision was handed down, the Commissioner of Fines Administration withdrew 31,121 of the 62,138 fines.
In a statement, Revenue NSW said it prioritised the health and safety of residents during the pandemic.
However, while it said it would withdraw the ""fail to comply"" fines, it added the decision ""does not mean the offences were not committed"".
Redfern Legal Centre (RLC), which brought the challenge to the Supreme Court, hailed Tuesday's decision as a ""momentous win"" in a tweet.
Before the ruling, centre solicitor Samantha Lee said ""this case is about more than just two people's fines"". 
""It is about the need to properly adhere to the rule of law, even during a pandemic.""
RLC has also alleged fines were disproportionately issued to people living in poorer areas, saying statistics ""show the majority of Covid-19 fines were issued to those residing in low-socioeconomic areas and areas with a large proportion of First Nations populations"".
An independent review into Australia's response to the COVID-19 pandemic found women, children and people with disabilities - among others - ""bore the brunt"". 
It also found Australians in the lowest 20% of socioeconomic status were three times more like to die of Covid-19 than those in the top 20%.
Australian states and territories imposed strict restrictions during the pandemic, which included limits on travel and movement outside the home and bans on travelling interstate. 
federal government also banned international travel for almost two years in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. 
New South Wales is currently experiencing its third Covid-19 Omicron wave with the state recording more than 31,000 cases this week.

Bo's victory in the men's mass start biathlon was his fourth gold of the Games, and his fifth medal overall.
His country's tally surpassed the previous best at a Winter Games of 14, first achieved by Canada in 2010.
Norway's Marte Olsbu Roiseland, meanwhile, has become the first person to win a medal in all four individual biathlon events at a Winter Games.
Roiseland took bronze in the women's mass start biathlon, to add to the gold she earned in the sprint and pursuit biathlon events, and bronze in the individual.

technology	Elon Musk suspends Kanye West from Twitter for inciting violence	"Kanye West has been suspended from Twitter and accused of ""inciting violence"" over offensive tweets - just two months after his last ban.
US rapper, who now goes by the name Ye, posted a series of erratic tweets - one of which appeared to show a symbol combining a swastika and a Jewish star.
witter's new boss Elon Musk was asked by one user to ""fix Kanye"".
West had ""violated our rule against incitement to violence"", Musk tweeted.
""Account will be suspended,"" Musk wrote in a Twitter post.
Also on Thursday, during an interview with US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and with his face covered in a mask, West praised Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and ranted about sin, pornography and the devil.
f the UK's Holocaust Educational Trust described West's comments as ""repulsive and sickening"". 
""These comments mixed with his high profile and huge following have dangerous consequences,"" chief executive Karen Pollock said.
In recent months West has caused controversy with a series of antisemitic and racist remarks - leading to clothing giant Adidas cutting ties with the rapper.
West was initially locked out of his Twitter and Instagram accounts after posting antisemitic messages in October. Both platforms removed West's posts - which accused rapper Diddy of being controlled by Jewish people - saying the star had violated policies on hate speech.
me in response to a backlash against his show at Paris Fashion Week, where he wore a T-shirt carrying the slogan ""White Lives Matter"".
Anti-Defamation League in the US branded his phrase ""hate speech"" and attributed it to white supremacists, who began using it in 2015 in response to the Black Lives Matter movement.
Earlier this year, West was suspended from Instagram for 24 hours in March after using a racial slur in reference to comedian Trevor Noah.
In 2018, singer Will.i.am led a backlash against West after he claimed the enslavement of African-Americans over centuries may have been a ""choice"" - remarks he later tried to clarify.
His latest Twitter ban comes hours after the right-wing social media platform Parler - which styles itself as a ""free speech"" alternative to mainstream platforms - said West could no longer buy the firm.
In a statement, Parlement Technologies said: ""The company has mutually agreed with Ye to terminate the intent of sale."" 
firm - which runs the much smaller platform, popular with conservatives and the far right - said the decision was made in mid-November.
""Parler will continue to pursue future opportunities for growth and the evolution of the platform for our vibrant community,"" the firm said in its statement.
Musk took control over Twitter in October and immediately embarked on a series of radical changes within the social media giant - including lifting the bans on controversial accounts.
He has clarified that he had no role in bringing West back on Twitter, saying the account was restored before he acquired the social media platform.
West was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago and has publicly spoken about his challenges with his mental health.
However, medical experts and people who share West's condition have warned that mental health problems do not go hand-in-hand with antisemitism."	/news/business-63826675

business	Kanye West: JP Morgan Chase cuts ties with rapper	"US banking giant JP Morgan Chase is ending its relationship with the rapper and designer Kanye West, who now goes by the name Ye, and his Yeezy brand.
A letter from the bank informing Mr West of the decision was posted on Twitter by a conservative commentator.
At the weekend, his Twitter and Instagram accounts were suspended after he posted anti-Semitic messages.
BBC understands the letter from JP Morgan pre-dated recent controversies, as it was sent on 20 September.
In the letter the bank gave Mr West until 21 November to transfer his business.
JP Morgan Chase declined to comment.
Mr West had previously taken to social media to criticise JP Morgan's leadership and said they would not give him access to the bank's chief executive Jamie Dimon.
He told Bloomberg in September that he was severing ties with his corporate partners and that ""it's time for me to go it alone"".
Representatives for Mr West did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.
move by JP Morgan comes as Mr West's business partnerships have come under increased scrutiny.
Last week, sportswear firm Adidas said it was reviewing its deal with him days after he showed a ""White Lives Matter"" T-shirt design at Paris Fashion Week.
mpany did not mention the controversy but said ""successful partnerships are rooted in mutual respect and shared values"".
Mr West responded on Instagram, claiming the firm ""stole"" his designs. That post now appears to have been deleted.
Adidas told the BBC it had made the decision to put the partnership under review after ""repeated efforts to privately resolve the situation.""
A spokesperson for the German sportswear company also said that the ""Adidas Yeezy partnership is one of the most successful collaborations in our industry's history.""
Last month, Mr West said he was ending his partnership with the retailer Gap.
He accused the firm of failing to honour terms of the deal, including by failing to open standalone stores for his Yeezy fashion label.

technology	Helping others with one-handed life hacks	"Chiara Beer used to hide her disabled right arm behind her back, afraid of receiving negative comments. But a brave decision one day inspired her to share her experience with the world and use it to help others too.
Chiara suffered a stroke aged two, leading to her developing dyslexia, the muscle disorder dystonia, and hemiplegia - a condition that causes weakness down her right side.
She would hide her disabled arm, afraid of receiving negative and hateful comments.
""It's OK to be different. My struggle was always that I looked different, which was quite a hard thing to deal with,"" she says.
But a photo - one she hadn't intended to upload at first because it showed her arm - started a journey towards her becoming a YouTuber and Instagram Reeler. 
""I really liked the picture and couldn't redo it [to hide the arm]. So I thought 'let's post it',"" Chiara tells BBC Newsbeat.
""Then I didn't get any nasty comments - I was getting questions.""
Curious viewers asked Chiara a lot about how she performs certain tasks one-handed, such as putting on make-up and doing her hair.
Pretty soon, she was receiving encouragement to create more videos, and ended up posting about activities including drawing and cooking.
And, after seeing the success of those videos, she was more than happy to share her tips.
""Because ultimately, that's my goal: to live as independently as I can for myself,"" she says.
Now the 27-year-old makes videos for the charity Different Strokes, demonstrating life hacks for people who, like her, can only use one hand.
She's covered a range of topics from hair and fashion to make-up and jewellery.
""I really wanted to help people who are struggling with stroke or hemiplegia to find a way to do things,"" she says.
According to the charity, one in four strokes happen in younger people.
But Chiara says there wasn't much information available when she was a child.
She says she's received messages, both from parents who have children with hemiplegia and people who've had strokes later in life, saying her videos have helped.
""People have said: 'you've made me believe that my child can be independent, you've helped me think that my child will be OK'.""
Looking back, Chiara says she's ""really proud"" of how far she's come.
""Had someone said to me, at 14, you're going to talk about your disability so openly, I would have been like: 'No, that's not happening',"" she says. 
But she has a message for her younger self and those in a similar position:
""Confidence comes with time, be more happy with yourself and more confident.""

health	COPD lung disease sufferers waiting years for diagnosis	"People living with severe lung disease in Northern Ireland need faster and more accurate care, a leading charity has said. 
One in four patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in the UK wait at least five years for a diagnosis, according to a report from Asthma + Lung UK Northern Ireland.
Up to 42,000 people in NI suffer from COPD, the charity says.
It has called for lung health to become a priority.
""We are hearing shocking stories of people spending years... struggling to breathe, unaware that they have a lung condition which could be managed with the right treatment and support,"" said Joseph Carter, head of Asthma + Lung UK Northern Ireland.
""Diagnosis of COPD needs to be faster and more accurate and there needs to be greater awareness of the seriousness of lung conditions and the signs and symptoms to look out for.""
rity is campaigning for a new lung health strategy to improve diagnostic rates, increase pulmonary rehabilitation services, and reduce the number of respiratory deaths in Northern Ireland.
COPD is an umbrella term for a group of incurable lung conditions which cause breathing difficulties. 
udes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It affects more than one million people in the UK. 
Every patient with COPD should get a yearly flu and a regular pneumonia vaccine, according to the charity. 
uld also have a personalised plan to help them manage their condition, be offered optimised treatment for any other medical conditions and support to stop smoking if they need it. 
Delays in diagnosis of COPD can result in loss of lung function.
report, Delayed Diagnosis and Unequal Care: The reality for people with COPD in the UK in 2022, was published on Tuesday ahead of World COPD Day on Wednesday.
Results are based on a survey of 6,500 people across the UK. The sample size for Northern Ireland was small but the charity said it mirrored the rest of the UK results. 
Sharon Stewart from Dungiven has first-hand experience of the condition after her father was diagnosed in 2018.
""My dad, Jimmy worked as a mechanic and car sprayer for many years,"" she said.
""He was always very outgoing. He played the drums and was a great entertainer. He loved getting out and about.""
When he became ill, there was no clear diagnosis but he had to give up work. 
Sharon said her father was on inhalers for two years before he was finally hospitalised and diagnosed with COPD in 2018. 
""As a family, we felt Jimmy was not getting the proper level of care,"" she said.
""When his breathing worsened, he was no longer able to go out or walk, he was always exhausted and tired.  
""His home life was also affected as it took almost one year for a stairlift to be installed. This meant he stayed most of the time upstairs in his bedroom so that he could access the bathroom.""
k a dire toll on him, she said.
""He was not the same person, he couldn't walk any distance because his breathing was so bad.""
Jimmy died in September 2021 at the age of 74.
family and community helped raise more than £5,700 for Asthma + Lung UK Northern Ireland. 
""We are aware of all the constraints on our health service, but these gaps in care are making things worse,"" said Sharon.
More than a third of people surveyed in the report said they were unable to recognise the signs of COPD and around 23% said they were misdiagnosed as their doctor thought they had a chest infection or cough. 
Respiratory conditions make up one of the top three killers in Northern Ireland.
Asthma + Lung UK Northern Ireland said people with lung conditions in the poorest neighbourhoods are three and half times more likely to die than those in the richest areas in Northern Ireland."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63625674
politics	Mothers in Cambridge start campaign to support congestion charge	"A group of mothers have gathered together to support a controversial traffic scheme which could see a Cambridge congestion charge brought in.
Greater Cambridge Partnership (GCP) is proposing a £5 charge to be introduced by 2026-27.
But it has sparked opposition from shopkeepers who fear it will hit trade.
Elisabeth Whitebread, from Parents for the Cambridge Sustainable Travel Zone, said it was fair that drivers pay for the pollution their car's produce.
group is holding a protest meeting at Parker's Piece in Cambridge city centre on Saturday, which was also the site of a demonstration against the charging plans in November.
rge would affect private vehicles across the whole city, including Addenbrooke's Hospital and the rest of the BioMedical Campus, between 07:00 and 19:00 on weekdays.
would also see £50m of investment to expand the bus network and improved walking and cycling routes.
Cambridgeshire County Council would have final approval of any plans.
Ms Whitebread told BBC Politics East: ""Cambridge is great place to raise children, but we need a transport system fit for the 21st Century.
""There are no easy answers to this sort of thing, and of cause the charges are going to come in, in a staggered way. There will be upfront investment before the charge comes in. 
""I do think it is fair that people who are driving and causing pollution and congestion are the ones who should pay for it. The council has signed up to a climate emergency so it is really time for them to 'walk the walk.'""
Elissa Meschini, Labour councillor and chair of the Greater Cambridge Partnership which is looking to put forward the plans, said:  ""We have to come clean about the challenges we face. All we ask at this point is that people appreciate the extent of the challenge we have to address. We haven't made a final decision and it's important people understand it isn't an easy solution.""
GCP said the scheme would cut the number of car trips in Cambridge by 50% .
John Whitelegg, a visiting professor at Liverpool John Moores University who has studied congestion charge schemes, said: ""I'm surprised to hear the 50% figure. 
""I think that might prove to be wildly out of line with the outcome.""
But Prof Whitelegg, who is a former Green Party spokesperson in sustainable transport, believed congestion charge schemes are the way forward, and people who originally oppose it will come around to supporting it in the end.
""There's a pattern. There is initial opposition, then reluctantly accepting the scheme is being done, and then really liking it and everyone finding the advantages of it,"" he said.
But the plans have provoked strong opposition.
Clare King, 64, who has lived in Cambridge for 30 years and drives across the city every day for her job in a supermarket, said: ""Rather than the 10 minute car journey, I would need to walk to a bus stop, wait for a bus, catch two buses, then get off a bus near work and then walk to work. 
""That journey would take me between 45 and 50 minutes, provided the buses came pretty quickly.
""We need to improve the buses. We don't need to do it through treating residents as cash cows.""
Neil Mackay's family has been running a hardware store in Cambridge for more than 100 years, selling items including heavy duty metal piping, tools, ladders, workwear and gardening equipment.
""The sorts of materials we supply. You can't take those on a bus,"" he said.
""If I was a tradesman coming into Cambridge and I wanted some materials and I had a choice between coming down to see my old friend Neil Mackay in East Road and paying £10, or going to an alternative supplier who might be outside the zone - of which there are plenty - who has similarly priced goods, which is he going to do?""

business	Anti-London policies will slow UK's financial recovery, report says	"Divisive ""them and us"" rhetoric about London and the rest of the UK will hinder national recovery from the cost-of-living crisis, according to a new report.
Centre for London says there is an opportunity for less antagonism and more partnership with ""levelling up"" likely to fade as a political slogan.
k tank argues investment outside of London should not come at the expense of the capital.
report, London's Contribution in the UK, concluded regional inequalities could be fixed by increasing overall spending, rather than cutting London's funding. Choking off government spending in the capital would hit the tax revenues on which investment around the UK depends, it said.
k tank carried out focus groups involving 2,000 people from London and elsewhere to find out how people feel about London's dominant status as the country's only ""global"" city.
On the whole, it found people outside London did not resent the capital. However, they were not convinced by arguments about the value of the City financial sector to the UK economy, in terms of tax revenue.
And participants in the focus groups did appreciate London's international reputation and its importance for tourism.
Centre for London analysis describes the impact of ""London-plus"" tourism, where London is the ""gateway"" to visitors but the benefits are spread far beyond.
Researchers found 71% of first-time holiday visitors to the UK came to the city. 
""This London-plus tourism is estimated to contribute more than £640m in spending a year, driven by the fact that these visitors spend between 24% and 64% more nights in the UK than those who just visit one location,"" the report said.
Indeed, in 2019 before the Covid-19 pandemic, London was visited by nearly 22 million tourists - around 63% of the total number who visited England and more than 53% of those who visited the UK.
gether, they spent nearly £16bn in the capital, accounting for 55% of tourism spending in the UK.
r spending supported one in seven of all jobs in London, 700,000 of them, and nearly 12% of the city's economic output, according to researchers.
report also found London's arts and cultural attractions were a major draw for domestic and international visitors. 
However, this is at risk, due the recently announced cuts to Arts Council funding, which have raised doubts about the future of institutions like the English National Opera. Under the plans, £24m of annual funding will be diverted outside of the capital.
Researchers also believe many Londoners are unable to access the city's wealth of cultural venues, and that cuts to public funding would make them less accessible still, particularly to low income families.
According to the report, the capital ""kickstarts"" innovations in public transport such as contactless payment, helping to make London fundamental to the UK's productivity and creativity.
And the report said Transport for London had entered into a private-sector partnership that allowed other cities to adapt its systems for their own network.
Former prime minister Boris Johnson made ""levelling up"" a key slogan of his premiership, although there was little consensus of what it meant.
With the future of levelling up unclear because of the recent political ""chaos"", Centre for London argues the strategy should focus on increasing overall investment spending, not cutting investment in London.
Claire Harding, research director, said: ""Levelling up could help everyone in the UK, but only if it is done properly. It must not be seen as an opportunity to create divisions between places or simply reduce London's funding, which is not a strategy that the public want and would only threaten the economy. 
""London's contribution has always been vital to the UK, ranging from a hub of world-class education, research and arts, to a place of pride representing the country on the global stage. We hope this report will convince policymakers to continue making the case for the city.""

business	Clacton Seaquarium closing down amid soaring energy costs	"An aquarium that is expecting its energy bills to quadruple by 2024 will close to visitors permanently at the end of this month.
Seaquarium at Clacton Pier, Essex, has been open for about four decades.
It is home to roughly 900 individual fish and other sea creatures, including smooth hound sharks, red-bellied piranhas and turtles.
Nigel Brown, communications manager for the pier, said energy costs were already £1,500 per month.
""It's a big operation for what is a relatively small part of our business,"" said Mr Brown.
""We like to think we've run it well, given a bit of education to children and helped push the conservation message.""
re has been some form of wildlife-based attraction the pier since the 1930s, which in the past has included whales, dolphins, sea lions and penguins.
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs recently gave it a positive veterinary inspection report.
uilding structure is about 150 years old and needs maintenance.
It was closed to visitors for much of last year during the pandemic, but conservation and maintenance work continued.
Seaquarium director Billy Ball said the venue, which charges £3 entry, would have to meet stricter regulatory standards if it were to renew its licence with Tendring District Council.
""If it was to remain, we would have also wanted to look to come up with more conservation activities and that was simply not viable,"" he said.
""We are now in a very different world with emphasis on protecting the environment quite rightly gaining greater priority.
""All things considered, including overheads and the rising cost of energy, we decided it was time to close that chapter in the pier's history and move forward.""
wners said they were in discussions with other aquariums, including Sealife Adventure in Southend, to rehome all the sea life.
Mr Brown said they hoped to replace it with another attraction, ""probably"" for younger children.

health	Fresh nurse strike dates announced in England	"Nurses will go on strike again on 18 and 19 January in England unless pay talks are opened, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has said.
Nurses at more hospital trusts than before will be involved in the strike action in the new year, the union said.
Meanwhile, the GMB union has called off a second day of ambulance strikes planned in England and Wales for 28 December.
But it announced a new co-ordinated walkout on 11 January. 
wo days of nurses strikes were held in England, Wales and Northern Ireland on 15 and 20 December, which resulted in more than 40,000 patient appointments and procedures being rescheduled.
On two consecutive days in January, there will be 12-hour walkouts by nurses at 55 health trusts in England - around a quarter.
Pat Cullen, head of the RCN, said the union had been left ""with no choice"" but to arrange January strikes.
""The government had the opportunity to end this dispute before Christmas but instead they have chosen to push nursing staff out into the cold again in January,"" Ms Cullen said. 
""The public support has been heart-warming and I am more convinced than ever that this is the right thing to do for patients and the future of the NHS.""
Health Secretary Steve Barclay said he was ""disappointed"" by the decision to take further strike action. He said meeting unions' pay demands would mean money being taken away from frontline services, causing delays to patients' treatment.
""Strikes are in no one's best interest, least of all patients, and I urge unions to reconsider further strike action before walkouts have a worse impact on patients,"" he added. 
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was ""really sad"" about the disruption being caused ""to so, so many people's lives, particularly at Christmas time.""
But he insisted he had ""acted fairly and reasonably"" in accepting public sector pay recommendations and could not risk inflation rising any further.

In Scotland, NHS workers are to be awarded an average pay increase of 7.5% - but nurses are still expected to announce strike dates in the new year. They rejected the pay deal, alongside midwives and staff belonging to the GMB union.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the deal was ""the biggest since devolution"" and he had no more money for pay this year - but he said he was prepared to meet unions during the festive period to stop further strike action.
Royal College of Midwives says its members in Scotland may also take action in 2023.
Up to 10,000 ambulance members were expected to walk out on Wednesday 28 December. 
union said it was scrapping the action next week so that ""the public will be able to enjoy Christmas without additional anxiety"".
f strike action on 11 January means GMB workers will again be striking on the same day as ambulance workers represented by Unison. 
It means thousands of paramedics, call handlers and technicians will walk out in nine of England's 10 trusts, and across Wales in the new year.
Unison said yesterday it planned two more days of strikes on 11 and 23 January in London, Yorkshire, the North West, North East and South West.
unions say they want the government to come to the table and negotiate pay in order to help retain staff and improve patient care.
Rachel Harrison, GMB National Secretary, said they were suspending action on 28 December because they had been overwhelmed by ""amazing public support"".
But she said the new January strike date showed the union's commitment to getting higher pay for ambulance staff was ""stronger than ever"".
""The government can now do what ambulance workers and the public want - get round the table and talk pay now. We are here 24/7. Any time, any place,"" she said.  
A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We will continue to work to bring together trade unions, employers and government to deliver the best possible outcomes for workers, while continuing to call on the UK government to use the funding it has to provide a fair pay offer to NHS staff and enable us to do the same in Wales.""
