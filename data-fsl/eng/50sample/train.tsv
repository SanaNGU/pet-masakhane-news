sports	Richard Kruse: Fencer become Britain's first-ever world number one	"Olympic foil fencer Richard Kruse has become Britain's first-ever world number one in the sport after claiming gold at the Tokyo World Cup in Japan.
35-year-old, who in 2018 became Britain's first world medallist in 58 years with silver in China, entered the event trailing world champion Alessio Foconi by 24 points.
However, the Italian's semi-final defeat, coupled with Kruse's 3-2 victory over the USA's Race Imboden in the final, moved the Briton to the top of the global standings.
Last year he told BBC Sport he would be able to ""retire happy"" if he could claim 10 World Cup wins, and he has now achieved nine.
After failing to claim a medal at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, British Fencing had all of their UK Sport funding removed for the Tokyo 2020 cycle and a subsequent funding drive initially raised just £170 in the first few weeks after it was launched.
However, they eventually hit their target and in December, British Fencing learnt they would receive £192,500 from UK Sport as a result of Kruse's successes.
Official rankings were introduced to the sport in 2001."	/sport/fencing/47015582
politics	Can Labour revive its fortunes in Scotland?	"Labour has outlined proposals for a series of constitutional reforms aimed in part at reviving the party's fortunes in Scotland.
Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown says the ground on which the battle is fought in Scotland ""is changing forever"", and that his party offers a fresh route through the debate over independence.
But is that true? Can Labour find a ""third way"" over a binary question? Does the party really need to win in Scotland to retake power - and how likely is that?
Labour is looking to the next general election, crafting a platform that it hopes can win back power - by promising to spread that power out around the country.
Many of the proposals laid out in a report by Gordon Brown are about reforming Westminster, such as by replacing the House of Lords, or by strengthening devolution to different regions of England.
When it comes to Scotland, and indeed Wales and Northern Ireland, the biggest reforms of devolution have already happened - driven by a Labour government, as party leader Sir Keir Starmer is keen to stress.
But it means there are not many big-ticket items left to promise. Perhaps the headline measure promised for Scotland is a more explicit devolved veto over Westminster lawmaking which crosses into devolved areas. 
gnificant development which would better allow Holyrood to push back on things like Brexit, but it is still fairly niche stuff.
me goes for ideas like extra legal protection for MSPs to speak out in parliament and a consultation on raising the ceiling for Holyrood's capital borrowing.
rall package and the broad promise of a reformed UK is a compelling alternative to what the other parties are pitching - independence under the SNP, or the status quo under the Conservatives.
With plans for an independence referendum in October 2023 having hit the buffers, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has suggested she will use the next election as a single-issue poll on the constitutional issue.
rospect of such a campaign makes it particularly important for Labour to have a convincing and consistent policy to pitch on the doorsteps.
roader proposition than just taking a side on the binary issue of independence. Labour needs to regain votes lost to both ends of the constitutional spectrum since the 2014 referendum, with the SNP and Tories having mopped up support as the parties of Yes and No.
And the party hopes its devolution-plus proposal means it will be able to talk about all kinds of other things during the campaign. Mr Brown highlighted the health service, youth employment, housing and living standards as particular examples.
SNP would not ignore such issues even if it did run on a one-line manifesto, of course. It's just that the party's answer would be that all of them could be enhanced using the powers of independence.
Labour's plan is to find a position that it can sell as less of a gamble than leaving the UK, but still a convincing step up from how things stand now.
And if they can pull it off, the prize for them would be twofold - in that it could kybosh the SNP's drive for independence at the same time as helping to retake Downing Street.
SNP are clearly alive to the potential challenge a Labour revival would pose to their project. That's why they are already painting their red rivals as a Tory-lite midwife of Brexit, hoping to find an attack line that sticks ahead of the big electoral test.
Labour leaders often say they need to win in Scotland again if they are to win back power. But are they right?
Certainly, the party's spell in the wilderness of Westminster opposition has coincided with a collapse in representation north of the border, with a single Scottish Labour MP clinging on compared to the scores returned in years gone by.
But because its former dominance has been supplanted by the SNP, Nicola Sturgeon's party has traded on the idea that this doesn't affect the balance at Westminster - because SNP MPs would not vote for a Conservative prime minster.
way they can continue to pitch themselves as the core anti-Tory vote north of the border, and could even end up in an influential position in a hung parliament.
rospect already being weaponised in Conservative campaigning, which is why Sir Keir has taken such a firm line on there being ""no deals"" with the SNP.
Of course, he would far rather win a majority on his own, without having to rely on support from any other party.
And given their recent history and enmity, trust is not at an all-time high between Labour and the SNP.
SNP has not always been as fervently anti-Tory as it is now; the parties routinely did budget deals when the SNP first took power  at Holyrood, when they shared an enjoyment of giving Labour a bloody nose.
And some students of Labour history still mutter about 1979, when the SNP's 11 MPs went through the voting lobbies with the Conservatives to hasten the demise of James Callaghan's government.
So there is more politics to this than the bare numbers might suggest.
rty's UK-wide polling has been strong in the wake of a Conservative meltdown which claimed the careers of two prime ministers in two months.
But when we do eventually get to an election, Labour does not have a huge list of obvious target seats in Scotland.
re are four constituencies with SNP majorities of under 10% where Labour was the runner up last time out - and oddly enough, in three of them the sitting MP has since left the party.
wo defected to Alba (Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, SNP majority 2.6%; and East Lothian, SNP majority 6.6%), while the member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West (SNP majority 9.7%) was found guilty of breaching Covid regulations.
r realistic target is Glasgow North East, an SNP majority of 7.5% - which has technically changed hands at every election since 2005, when it was held by the Commons Speaker Michael Martin.
Every other constituency that Labour might be looking at has a double-digit majority. Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill is the next most marginal, at 11.7%.
And they are not close to challenging in any of the seats held by the Conservatives, all of which are straight fights between the SNP and Tories.
re are more possibilities when you look to the 2017 polls, when there were 26 seats where Labour was within relative touching distance of the SNP, including four which it won and six where the SNP majority was under 2%.
As it stands, it might be fair to conclude that Labour's revival in the polls has more to do with Tory troubles than bold new policy ideas.
r has been in the pipeline for almost two years, and doesn't include much that's particularly new or surprising. Getting rid of the Lords would be a big step, but reform of that institution has been chewed over for years.
't mean this kind of announcement isn't important, though. Sir Keir knows his party needs substance to its platform, and in Scotland the constitution is an absolutely key part of that.
In the elections since the 2014 referendum, the SNP has campaigned as the party of Yes to independence, the Tories as the party of No, and Labour as the party of ""wouldn't you rather talk about something else""?
may persist in some ways. The party's position may well still be that other topics are more worthy of attention, and indeed it may be that they prove more compelling for the electorate next time around.
But in trying to carve out a particular position of their own, Labour are now seeking to play an active role in the constitutional debate rather than duck it altogether."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63312368
technology	Black women missing from tech industry, says report	"Up to 20,000 black women are ""missing"" from the tech industry in the UK, according to a joint report by campaigners and a representative body.
report says the proportion of black women in IT is two-and-a-half times smaller than that of the UK workforce as a whole.
Campaigning group Coding Black Females said tech ""desperately needed"" more people from a range of backgrounds.
Industry bodies acknowledge that ""more must be done"" to support diversity.
Analysing data from the Office of National Statistics, the authors of the Coding Black Females (CBF) and BCS report found that black women made up 1.8% of the UK workforce but only 0.7% of those working in technology.
An extra 20,000 black women would need to be recruited in addition to the 12,000 already working in IT to fill the gap.
Women are also under-represented in senior leadership roles, it said. In 2021, just 17% of IT directors were female, according to the report.
report says while ethnic-minority representation in general is higher among IT specialists than in the wider workforce, that is largely due to the high proportion of tech professionals of Indian ethnicity.
uthors also sought to shed light on the experience of black women in the industry through surveys and in-depth interviews.
Siba Munsanje, a software engineer at Deloitte, told researchers: ""You have to get used to knowing that you are the only one in the room on the team, in the project, at the conference"".
Nicola Martin, head of quality engineering at Adarga, a UK-based artificial-intelligence software firm, said: ""Now stats are being published related to diversity in tech, we can see there is still a lot of work to do. 
""The tech industry needs to encourage more diversity to ensure that people want to stay in the industry.""
report asked 350 black women to tell them about their experiences.
Respondents felt that more could be done to encourage black female applicants - including work in relevant communities to raise awareness of opportunities.
Some women said the interview process and workplace culture would put off applicants. One respondent quoted in the report said the ""tech bro"" culture was exhausting.
Charlene Hunter, chief executive of CBF, told the BBC women's experiences showed there were still barriers to getting a job in tech.
""You hear often stories of people applying for roles and not really being given any actual feedback. You know you meet all of the criteria, but something doesn't quite feel right.""
But the discrepancy was not just about numbers employed but also their opportunities to build careers.
""We need senior leaders to match the large numbers of black women currently appearing in tech and engineering adverts, with genuine opportunities to progress into rewarding jobs,"" Ms Hunter said.
She drew particular attention to the development of artificial intelligence - there is a concern that AI systems can display bias against different ethnicities and genders.
Greater diversity in senior positions would help ensure that thinking about bias was ""included in every part of your design process"".
Rashik Parmar, chief executive of the BCS, the professional body for computing, said: ""We will only be able to build the systems that serve everyone if the diversity of humanity is represented in the project teams that design and build these systems.""
Nimmi Patel, from trade association Tech UK, said while steps were being taken to support diversity and inclusion within the tech workforce, ""clearly more must be done"". 
""Both industry and government should work together to inspire, educate, and attract diverse talent to ensure black women - and women in general - enter and progress through the industry,"" she said."	/news/technology-63402337
sports	Tokyo Olympics: Kate French storms to modern pentathlon gold for Great Britain	"Kate French stormed away from the field with a dominant run in the final event of the modern pentathlon to earn Great Britain's 18th gold of the Tokyo Olympics.
30-year-old began the laser run - a 3,200-metre run punctuated by four shooting stages - in fifth place but took the lead during the second running section and never looked back.
French finished more than 15 seconds ahead of Lithuania's London 2012 champion Laura Asadauskaite, who surged through the field from 13th to take the silver medal.
But it was an all-round performance that delivered gold for the Briton, who set a personal best in the 200m freestyle swimming on her way to an Olympic-record points total of 1,385.
French's versatility was summed up in the final event where her composure and accuracy in the four laser target shoots - missing just twice from 22 attempts - gave her the breathing space needed to leave her rivals in her wake on the running sections.
""I just knew I had to focus, and I knew I could do it if I focused on my shooting and ran as fast as I could,"" she told BBC Sport at Tokyo Stadium, where all five events were held.
""I tried not to think too much about getting a medal. I'm so pleased I was able to hold it together. It's always been a dream and I can't believe it's come true.""
After finishing sixth in the opening fencing round on Thursday, French swam her heat in the pool in two minutes 10.18 seconds to remain in contention in eighth.
She jumped up to fifth after a dramatic showjumping round, in which competition leader Annika Schleu saw her medal hopes crumble - the German dropped from first to 31st with an incomplete round after her horse refused several fences.
Other than at Rio 2016, where French finished fifth on her Olympic debut, Great Britain have won medals in every women's modern pentathlon since the sport was introduced to the Games in 2000.
French, from Kent, continued that proud record by claiming Team GB's first gold in the event since Stephanie Cook topped the podium in that inaugural competition in Sydney 21 years ago.
""I'm so, so pleased, especially after Rio. It broke the chain of the medal run. I couldn't be more pleased to have joined the rest of the British women that have done so, so well in the past,"" she added.
Her showjumping skills established the platform for the triumph, as she went clear over each obstacle and picked up just six time penalties for a score of 294 out of 300.
questrian event is always the most unpredictable of the pentathlon disciplines as riders are paired with random horses just 20 minutes before the start - and a number of competitors, including the unfortunate and distraught Schleu, drew the short straw.
French overhauled the German - who was in tears for much of her ride - as well as Ireland's Natalya Coyle, who had sat fourth but also dropped down the standings after a heavily penalised round.
With points earned in the previous events converted into a time handicap for the laser run, French began 15 seconds behind leader Uliana Batashova but soon whittled that down.
Asadauskaite actually ran the fastest time in the final discipline to come from nowhere into silver, as Hungary's Sarolta Kovacs took bronze, but the gap French had established was too big to be breached and she crossed the line with a beaming smile.
French's fellow Briton Joanna Muir also enjoyed a fine laser run as she improved her position from 21st to finish in 14th place.
For the first time at the Olympics, all the disciplines were held in one stadium, with a pool erected at one end of Tokyo Stadium."	/sport/olympics/58114320
technology	MrBeast overtakes PewDiePie as most-subscribed YouTuber	"MrBeast has ended PewDiePie's reign as the YouTuber with the most subscribers - the first change at the top in almost 10 years.
Swedish creator PewDiePie, whose real name is Felix Kjellberg, became the most-subscribed YouTuber in August 2013 with his gaming reaction videos.
In 2019, he was the first person to attract 100 million subscribers.
But the philanthropy of MrBeast, really called Jimmy Donaldson, gained him his 112 millionth subscriber this month.
Although YouTube does not show the exact numbers, that pushed him above PewDiePie's 111 million.
MrBeast is known for videos featuring huge cash giveaways and prizes, as well as charity work.
In 2021, he launched a separate philanthropy-themed YouTube channel, which itself has more than 10 million subscribers, and he has a licensed charity that functions as a food bank to feed communities across the US.
He and fellow YouTuber Mark Rober organised international collaborative fundraisers TeamSeas and TeamTrees, which focus on environmental issues - the latter raising more than $24m (£16.7m) to plant 20 million trees worldwide.
And PewDiePie himself donated almost $70,000 to the TeamTrees project.
British YouTuber Steven Bridges, whose videos have millions of views on the platform, told the BBC MrBeast has ""mastered the skill"" of making compelling content.
""There's probably no other YouTuber in the world who understands it as well as MrBeast,"" he said. 
""Making an entertaining video is one thing, but ensuring that every single second of a video keeps the viewer hooked is very difficult to pull off, and MrBeast's retention - the percent of the video the average viewer watches - and view counts speak for themselves.
""Really, MrBeast is playing the game of making the most entertaining videos that appeal to the biggest number of people, and he's consistently knocking it out of the park. 
""I don't think there's any YouTuber out there that's surprised MrBeast has taken the number one spot.""
ugh neither has yet commented on the milestone, PewDiePie previously said he thought MrBeast would ""definitely"" overtake him.
""I can't wait for it to be over,"" he joked in a video from August 2022. ""He definitely deserves it. I hope he does it.""
And while MrBeast has become the most-subscribed individual user on YouTube, he is some way off having the biggest YouTube channel. 
-Series, an Indian music video publishing company, leads the way in that category with more than 200 million subscribers.
Despite their apparent rivalry for the top YouTuber crown, MrBeast publicly supported PewDiePie when the music video channel rose to prominence.
In 2018, PewDiePie had the top YouTube channel altogether, and became embroiled in a - mostly jokey - public rivalry with T-Series over the top spot.
MrBeast was the first prominent YouTuber to make videos supporting PewDiePie, buying radio adverts and billboards in North Carolina urging people to subscribe to him.
Over the course of a year, PewDiePie eventually lost the top channel spot to T-Series, although he went from about 60 million to 90 million subscribers in the contest, making his lead as top YouTuber apparently unassailable.

politics	Boris Johnson: Former PM announces plans to stand at next election	"Boris Johnson has told his local Conservative Party he will stand again as an MP at the next general election, the BBC has been told.
Conservatives have given their MPs until 5 December to confirm whether they wish to contest the next election - which must be held by early 2025.
So far, 11 Tory MPs have announced they will not stand for re-election. 
re had been suggestions Mr Johnson would stand down from Parliament after he was ousted as prime minister.
MPs can still stand down before the next election without letting the party know ahead of time. 
In October, Mr Johnson ran to replace Liz Truss as prime minister and passed the threshold of 100 nominations from his parliamentary colleagues, only to withdraw from the race hours before the deadline.
Mr Johnson has been the MP for Uxbridge and Ruislip in west London since 2015. He was elected to the seat while still serving as mayor of London. 
xt election will be the fourth time he has run to represent the constituency. 
Mr Johnson has a 7,210 vote majority after securing a 1.8% swing to the Conservatives at the 2019 election. 
On 5 December, the Boundary Commission will end its consultation on new constituency boundaries for the next election. Conservative campaign headquarters has asked Tory MPs to confirm if they plan to stand for re-election before then.
Under current proposals, Mr Johnson could gain support when his constituency is redrawn to absorb some new Tory leaning areas.
Levelling Up minister Dehenna Davison, Chloe Smith, the former work and pensions secretary, and Will Wragg, the chair of the public administration select committee, have all said they will stand down.
Uxbridge and South Ruislip Conservative association said it ""fully supported Boris Johnson as our local MP and candidate at any future election"".

technology	FTX woes: 'I'm waiting to get £2,000 back from crypto giant'	"FTX users have described feeling ""hopeful"" after withdrawals on the cryptocurrency exchange have appeared to restart.
mas Culham, 22, told the BBC that he had lodged a withdrawal request for £2,000.
Bitcoin touched a two-year low after the Binance pulled out of a deal to rescue its smaller rival, FTX.
xchange, used to buy and sell digital tokens, is still advising customers not to make deposits.
According to Coindesk and reports from users on social media, the troubled platform has allowed some customers to withdraw funds for the first time in days.
mas, a 22-year-old from Kingston, has been an FTX customer for more than a year, and describes it as a ""hub for crypto"".
He says he was able to lodge a withdrawal request for £2,000 he held on the exchange, which he describes as a ""really significant amount of money"".
But he says he has concerns around the volume of requests made by FTX customers, and is not sure whether or not they will all be serviced as the company battles on.
On Thursday, Bitcoin fell below $16,000 (£14,049) for the first time since 2020. Investor confidence was hit by the news that Binance had scrapped its deal to buy FTX, citing concerns over due diligence.
re are also fears of further crypto market volatility if FTX goes bust.
Concerns about the company's financial health reportedly triggered $6bn (£5.2bn) of withdrawals in just three days.
""I thought FTX was safe"", another customer told the BBC earlier on Thursday.
""I've got about $3,000 (£2,630) worth of coins in my own crypto wallet but more worrying is that I invested $33,000 (£28,900) for my mum and stepdad through the app. I don't yet have the heart to tell them what's happened.""
Binance said reports of ""mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations"" had swayed its decision not to buy FTX. 
Reuters news agency reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was investigating FTX's handling of customer funds and its crypto-lending activities.
markets regulator is also examining whether the platform has broken laws with regards to how it has handled customer assets.
Binance said in a statement posted on Twitter that the issues facing FTX were ""beyond our control or ability to help"".
""Every time a major player in an industry fails, retail consumers will suffer. We have seen over the last several years that the crypto ecosystem is becoming more resilient and we believe in time that outliers that misuse user funds will be weeded out by the free market.""
FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance's chief executive Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao are two of the most powerful people in the cryptocurrency market and high-profile rivals.
ressure on FTX came in part from Mr Zhao, who had tweeted on Sunday that Binance would sell its holdings of FTX's digital token, known as FTT. The token has lost around 90% of its value this week.
Binance stepped in on Tuesday, saying it had signed a letter of intent to buy FTX's non-US unit. But it added it had ""the discretion to pull out from the deal at any time"".
Mr Zhao tweeted on Wednesday: ""Sad day. Tried, but [crying emoji]"".
As well as Bitcoin dropping on the news, shares in the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase fell by more than 9.5%.
Meanwhile, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital said it will completely write off its more than $210m investment in FTX, as the cryptocurrency exchange is at risk of bankruptcy.
""Based on our current understanding, we are marking our investment down to $0,"" the company said in a statement posted on Twitter.
April Joyner, a correspondent at Business Insider in New York, told the BBC's Today programme the problems at FTX could be quite serious.
""If FTX were to go under a lot of people could potentially lose their money depending on what's going on there,"" she said.
A notice on its website still reads: ""FTX is currently unable to process withdrawals. We strongly advise against depositing.""
FTX was approached by BBC News for comment.
""It's also led to a lot of turmoil on crypto markets - we've seen prices of Bitcoin, Etherium etc fall and so there's a lot of distress and worries about the crypto markets right now,"" Ms Joyner added.
Ms Joyner said the ""different players"" in cryptocurrency firms were ""very enmeshed"" with each other which meant ""if one entity has some sort of weakness it can bring down a lot of other players"".
re is a growing list of cryptocurrency businesses that have failed because of a lack of cash reserves.
Adding to the pressure, the SEC and other regulators have been ratcheting up scrutiny of the industry as concerns grow about how crypto platforms are trading.
Earlier this year, a subsidiary of crypto firm BlockFi agreed to pay a record penalty to settle charges related to its retail lending product."	/news/business-63577783

politics	I'm a Celebrity: 'Matt Hancock should let someone else be our MP'	"Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock surpassed expectations to reach the final day of ITV's I'm A Celebrity and come third in a public vote. But has his popularity on a reality TV show impressed people in his West Suffolk constituency, and could it boost his ailing political career? The BBC has been speaking to voters.
Nigel Bingley, 47, of Mildenhall, can see both sides of the argument.
""I know there's a mixed opinion - I think some people think he's gone in for the financial benefit [Mr Hancock has been paid an appearance fee, but has said he would make a donation to charity].
""We only see politicians as politicians and when we do hear about their private lives it's usually something negative.
""I think he's gone in [to the jungle] to show he's a real human being and he's not just a politician; he has a life outside politics.
""I've seen a different side of him, more of a humane side and he has had it quite bad in there, which is understandable.""
Asked if an MP should be on a reality TV show when Parliament is sitting, he says: ""I understand why people feel the way they feel.
""He's off in Australia, he's earning a nice little bit of money from that privilege.
""There are problems here that need to be sorted out, and yes, I think he should be here. 
""So long as he comes back and gets his nose to the ground and starts doing what he needs to do and gets to grips with some of the issues in Mildenhall.""
Earlier this month, Lisa Smith, from Newmarket, said Hancock going on to I'm A Celebrity was ""a disgrace"", that he did a ""poor job"" representing constituents and did not deserve to be their MP.
Now the contest is over, she believes he has not redeemed himself. 
""For me it's not just about the Covid situation, it's about the way he has treated his constituents, both before and after the pandemic,"" she says.
""Him disappearing and going off to film reality TV shows is not dedicating his time to his constituents who needed someone here dealing with issues that he is being paid to deal with. 
""Sadly I think he will come back and carry on like it's all perfectly normal, however I don't think he should come back to being an MP for West Suffolk, whether that be as a Tory [Mr Hancock has lost the Conservative whip for going on the show] or as an independent. 
""He should walk away and let someone else take over.""
When Mr Hancock went into the jungle, Stuart Dillon, from Haverhill, told the BBC he had been a poor MP, which he held with a majority of 23,194 in the 2019 general election.
Reflecting on the MP's third-place finish, the 47-year-old says: ""I didn't watch the show but everyone voting for him to do the tasks did him a huge favour.
""Nothing has changed for me because he still left his constituents without parliamentary representation, all for fame-chasing. 
""Whether he survives as an MP most likely will depend on whether the whip is restored.
""If it is, the Tories will rally around him and this is a safe seat for that party. 
""Personally I think he should resign as an MP and I would be saying that regardless of what party he was in - an MP is paid very well and that's the job he should be doing.""
David Venables, 73, sitting in a cafe in Mildenhall, says he enjoyed watching his MP in the jungle. 
""I think Matt has done very, very well, but he should have been here laying a wreath on Poppy Day,"" he says.
""I think he's proved his point, he's only an normal human being and he's done very well in there and I say good luck to him.
""He took everything that they threw at him. 
""It would have been nice if he had let people know where he was going, then perhaps other people would have taken it the same [as me].
""A lot of people have been very disappointed he wasn't here.""
Asked if he would be pleased to see him back at work as an MP, he says: ""Why not? He did a lot of a good when he was here, so I haven't got a problem with that at all.""
Ian Houlder, local Conservative Association member and West Suffolk district councillor, has called for Mr Hancock's deselection.
He said he was ""absolutely speechless"" when he learned his MP was going into the jungle, and described him as a ""damn awful role model"".
""He's letting down his party, his colleagues in Parliament who are doing a difficult job,"" he says.
""We're not in happy times in the country, whether you're Labour, Green, or whatever, everyone's in the same boat - we're fiscally up the creek with very few paddles to pull on.
""The whole thing [I'm a Celebrity] is false - it's staged, it's an act. 
""It's that attitude that annoyed me - not that he was going to do a game show - just don't go out there to do something you're not paid to do.""
He says Mr Hancock ""broke the trust of the public"" and should have resigned as MP, not just as a secretary of state, when he broke his own social distancing rules during the Covid lockdown.
""I think he should say 'I've had a good innings, I'm not going to stand at the next election'.
""But let's be truthful - he's got little honour, little principle, little integrity and little probity - and he's shown he doesn't care about the constituency.
""Do the right thing and step down, or tell your constituents you're stepping down at the next election.
""If you think you're going to be a media star, great, but you shouldn't be my representative.""
In June last year, Mr Hancock resigned as health secretary after he was caught breaking coronavirus social distancing rules by having an affair in his ministerial office with Gina Coladangelo, who was his aide at the time. She was there to greet him as he left the jungle camp after losing Sunday's vote.
After he lost the Tory whip campaign groups 38 Degrees and Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice demanded his removal from the jungle.
He has previously stressed the first thing he will do after leaving Australia will be to return to West Suffolk and hold a surgery with his constituents.
Speaking to BBC Look East, Business Secretary Grant Shapps criticised his fellow MP's decision to join the show, as had Prime Minister Rishi Sunak at the time.
""I think it's right for people to expect their MP to be in Parliament and he will be back, I assume, next week,"" he says.

entertainment	Panto back at Morecambe Winter Gardens after 50 year hiatus	"Pantomime has returned to Morecambe's Winter Gardens Theatre after a 50 year hiatus. 
Cinderella is the first panto to be staged at the resort's historic theatre after a marathon restoration project.
re was built in 1897 at the height of the British seaside boom, but falling box office returns saw the venue close in 1977.
Campaigners bought the theatre in 2006 and have just celebrated their ""busiest year ever"". 
Paul Anderton, who sits on the Winter Gardens Trust, said: ""We've had a marvellous year. 
""I think we've had 33,000 visitors, which is a record. The panto rounds off things nicely for us.""
Wayne Miller, who is playing Buttons in this year's production, added: ""It's an honour to be playing here knowing the history of the Winter Gardens. 
""The Who, Julie Andrews and Laurence Olivier all played here. So to be treading these same boards as those legends is such an honour.""
Volunteers at the trust raised more than half-a-million pounds during the pandemic to install a new heating system and repair the venue's ceiling. 
Mr Anderton said the trust were now trying to raise £400,000 for further works. 
""We've now submitted a grant application to the cultural development fund. We need to match that funding, so we need about £400,000 raising separately, but we're well on target"", he said.

business	JetBlue airline boss over-hiring to beat staff exodus	"f US low-fare carrier JetBlue has said it is necessary to over-hire staff because of the rate at which people are still leaving the industry.
Robin Hayes was speaking as thousands of travellers have been hit by recent disruption, caused largely by staff shortages that have blighted the re-start of air travel after the pandemic. 
Airlines have cut summer schedules and made last-minute cancellations. 
""I now need to over-hire just to keep the number I need,"" he told the BBC. 
""With Covid, we lost a lot of experienced people,"" he added.
Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during Covid lockdowns, have found it difficult to recruit enough staff as demand for holidays has surged.
JetBlue had he said seen the situation ""normalise"" as the summer has progressed. 
But he said the firm, like other airlines, had adjusted its hiring plan to cope with people leaving more quickly - by employing more staff. 
By the end of 2022, half of JetBlue's employees would have been with the airline for less than two years. 
""Even if you can get the people, they don't have the same experience as someone who was doing that job for 10 or 15 years, so it's going to take longer for them to learn the skills,"" said Mr Hayes.
justments can take ""some months"" but Mr Hayes said Jet Blue has increased its training capacity, added more simulators and built extra classrooms in order to keep hiring.  
""Your attrition is much higher,"" he added. ""You're hiring people but then they're leaving more quickly so you then have to adjust your hiring plan.""
Mr Hayes does not expect the aviation industry to be back to normal until next year.
He said airlines would approach 2023 more ""cautiously"" than they had this year when many carriers, including JetBlue, have had to scale back their operations due to the resourcing challenges. 
He said he expected that by the end of this year, business travel would likely recover to 80% of 2019 levels.
US has been dealing with problems caused by a shortage of pilots. According to United Airlines, pilots are expected to remain in short supply for years. 
rline recently said the country is only able to produce a maximum of 7,000 pilots a year, but carriers need 13,000 this year. 
However, in the UK shortages are worse for cabin crew and ground staff. 
Last week JetBlue reported a £125m loss for April to the end of June, but Mr Hayes says he believes the company will return to profit in the July to September period.
By the end of October, JetBlue will have increased the number of flights it operates between the UK and US from one to five a day. 
It comes a year after JetBlue entered the transatlantic market, with its first daily service between New York and London Heathrow and it now also runs a new daily service between Boston and London Gatwick. 
Mr Hayes said he expected ticket prices to go down slightly as jet fuel begins to retreat from its high prices. 
He said JetBlue had been only slightly affected by the Heathrow flight cap which saw the airport limit the number of passengers who can depart each day to 100,000 over the peak summer months - 4,000 fewer than current levels. 
move prompted JetBlue to halt ticket sales a couple of times, although this has not had a major impact on its operations. "	/news/business-62408122
entertainment	Avicii's family sell music rights to Abba star's company	"family of dance musician Avicii have sold 75% of the rights to his master recordings and publishing to the Swedish entertainment company Pophouse.
will allow Avicii's parents to concentrate on the foundation they established after his death in 2018.
retain the remaining 25% of his rights, ""to ensure a dignified tone"" in how his music is used and promoted.
Pophouse was established by Abba star Björn Ulvaeus in 2014, and runs the Abba Voyage show in London. 
In a press release announcing the Avicii deal, the company revealed sales figures for the groundbreaking virtual concert for the first time - with 650,000 tickets sold, and more than 160 sold out performances.
Avicii was born Tim Bergling in 1989, and rose to prominence after posting tracks he'd made in his Stockholm bedroom to dance music websites. 
He set himself apart from his peers by writing songs with emotional pop hooks - and scored a major international hit with Wake Me Up, which blended folky, bluegrass melodies with club-ready beats.
Bergling went on to produce music for Madonna and Coldplay and became one of the world's highest-paid DJs, but he suffered from alcoholism and depression and eventually took his own life at the age of 28.
Since then, his parents Klas Bergling and Anki Lidén have overseen his estate, arranging a star-studded tribute concert, licensing a video game based on his music, and opening an interactive tribute museum in Stockholm earlier this year (the latter was also a joint project with Pophouse).
In a statement, Bergling explained that selling a majority stake in his son's music rights would help to secure his legacy.
""My wife and I feel that as we are getting older, we do not have the right energy level or required skills to fully keep ahead of the new streaming and digital developments vital for such a big, international artist as Tim,"" he wrote. 
""Through this deal, we are also securing the Tim Bergling Foundation's long-term finances, creating opportunity to act decisively on the foundation's commitments to supporting such important issues as mental health and well-being of young people.""
He explained that the deal would bring Avicii's music ""to the widest possible audience"" and ""take care"" of his international fanbase. 
""Since Tim took his life, as a family, we have not had sufficient time for his fans that they so deserve, and have lacked the ability to follow up on their correspondence and other contact with us,"" Bergling wrote.
""We leave neither Tim nor his contribution to the world. He is always within us and so is his music.""
Avicii deal comes six months after Pophouse acquired the master recordings and publishing assets of dance icons Swedish House Mafia. No figure has been disclosed for the acquisition.
five years have seen a flurry of similar deals, with artists like Bob Dylan, Shakira, Blondie and Neil Young selling the rights to their catalogues to companies who promise to safeguard their legacy, while profiting from the royalties.

technology	Elon Musk: Twitter asks NI secretary what 'tosh' looks like	"witter's billionaire owner Elon Musk has responded to the Northern Ireland secretary of state after he called for fake news to be eliminated from the platform.
xchange came after Chris Heaton-Harris rubbished rumours of his resignation after a fake email was circulated.
Mr Heaton-Harris described the fake resignation email as ""utter tosh"". 
world's richest man replied, asking: ""What does a tosh look like?""
He then replied to Mr Musk on Twitter, joking that he had been referring to ""and/or the content of my speeches"".
An email, purporting to be from the Northern Ireland Office, was sent to print titles on the Northern Ireland Office's media circulation list from an anonymous account - ""pressreleasing16@gmail.com"".
Coming hours after Mr Heaton-Harris extended the deadline for calling a fresh Stormont election, it contained a fake quote saying the NI Secretary had resigned for ""personal reasons"".
A short time later, the NIO alerted media outlets to rebut the fake email and confirmed Mr Heaton-Harris remained in post.
On Thursday morning Mr Heaton-Harris said he thought an email system had been hacked, joking: ""I thought it was my mum.""
Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the email has not been reported to them and they were not looking into it.
BBC News NI has contacted the NIO for comment.
Mr Musk has vowed to clamp down on Twitter accounts impersonating other people.
""Any Twitter handles engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying 'parody' will be permanently suspended,"" he tweeted.
Wider concerns have been raised about the spread of misinformation on the platform after Mr Musk's $44bn (£38.3bn) deal to take over Twitter in October. 
Mr Musk has previously described himself as a ""free speech absolutist"" and has signalled he is willing to reverse the bans of controversial users, including Donald Trump.
He has announced half of Twitter's staff were being let go, a week after he bought the company in a $44bn (£38.7bn) deal.
Mr Musk said he had ""no choice"" over the cuts as the company was losing $4m (£3.51m) a day. He has blamed ""activist groups pressuring advertisers"" for a ""massive drop in revenue"".
uts - as well as Mr Musk's fierce advocacy of free speech - have led to speculation that Twitter could water down its efforts on content moderation.
While the tech magnate has ambitions to allow Twitter to become a virtual ""town square"" where users can exchange robust views, he has stressed, to advertisers in particular, that the platform's moderation policy has not changed yet."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63582327
politics	Scotland Covid inquiry: Lord Brailsford appointed new chair	"A new judge has been appointed to lead the Scottish Covid-19 inquiry. 
Lady Poole quit the role earlier this month for personal reasons and now the Scottish government has announced Lord Brailsford will take over from Friday. 
quiry has also seen the resignation of four members of its legal team.
Deputy first minister John Swinney said Lord Brailsford had the necessary ""skills, integrity and experience"" to continue the work of the Covid inquiry. 
Mr Swinney told Holyrood he was confident the swift replacement of Lady Poole meant the inquiry would not be delayed. 
Scottish Covid-19 inquiry will look at the Scottish government's actions throughout the pandemic, from introducing lockdown to the delivery of testing and vaccines.
It will also focus on infection control in care homes, including the transfer of patients from hospitals.
Mr Swinney also announced the inquiry will change its terms of reference to include ""a clear reference"" to the probe taking a human rights-based approach. 
He said: ""The Scottish government wants the inquiry to be delivered at speed and to address the range of questions that people have - the bereaved, in particular - so that we can learn lessons and benefit from them as early as possible. 
""That is why arrangements for identifying a new judicial chair for the inquiry have been taken forward urgently to ensure a swift and successful transition.""
Families who lost loved ones to Covid have previously told Mr Swinney they felt ""betrayed"" by the handling of the inquiry amid fears of delays.
Mr Swinney said it would now be for the new chairman to determine how handover arrangements will work in practice.
Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane said that while the appointment of a new chair was a step forward, ""there is still a lack of a clear commitment from the deputy first minister over just how long this inquiry will go on for"".
He added: ""We've seen costs spiral out of control and intolerable delays on other crucial inquiries, including the Edinburgh tram inquiry, and that simply cannot happen here. Grieving families must get the truth about what went wrong and get the answers they deserve.""
His comments were echoed by Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour's health spokeswoman, who said no further delays should occur.
Lord Brailsford, a Judge of the Supreme Courts, said: ""The public are rightly looking for answers and no more so than the loved ones of the nearly 16,000 people in Scotland who died during this pandemic. 
""I am immensely aware of the enormous responsibility this places on me and the inquiry. 
""I promise the families that, along with the inquiry team, I will work independently to establish the facts and ensure the inquiry thoroughly examines the decisions taken throughout the pandemic."""	/news/uk-scotland-63416975
business	Train drivers very close to going on strike, union warns	"rain drivers are ""very close"" to going on strike and could walk out within weeks, according to their union. 
Drivers at eight rail companies voted on Monday in favour of industrial action in a row over pay.
Mick Whelan, general secretary of Aslef, told the BBC that strike action could happen in the coming weeks if talks over wage rises stall. 
""We don't do this lightly,"" he said. ""We see it as a sign of failure when we do have to do it."" 
However, he pointed out that the union had received a strong mandate from its members to take industrial action with drivers voting overwhelmingly of strikes. 
But the Department for Transport (DfT) said: 'It is very disappointing that, rather than commit to serious dialogue with the industry, Aslef are first seeking to cause further misery to passengers by joining others in disrupting the rail network.""
Mr Whelan did not say when strikes might begin. Unions must give 14 days' notice.
uncement has led to fears of disruption to the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, which is expected to attract about one million tourists between 28 July and 8 August.
rain drivers at the following companies have voted to strike:
Separately, about 2,500 members of the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) also voted in favour of strike action on Monday.
Rail services have already been hit by three days of strikes in June when 40,000 members of the RMT union who work for 13 train companies and Network Rail walked out.  
RMT has resumed talks with Network Rail, which owns and operates the UK's rail infrastructure, as well as the train companies over pay rises.  The RMT recently told the BBC that it is ""not in any rush"" to call for further strikes in July. 
Commenting on why Aslef members voted for industrial action, Mr Whelan said: ""Quite simply, we haven't had a pay rise for three years. Train drivers went to work during the pandemic, we moved food and medicine around the country, we got other key workers to work and with the cost of living increase and inflation going through the roof, people feel they deserve a pay rise.""
DfT said: ""We urge the union bosses to reconsider and work with its employers, not against them, to agree a new way forward.""
It added: ""Our railway is in desperate need of modernisation to make it work better for passengers and be financially sustainable for the long term."" 
But Mr Whelan said: ""If you want productivity you pay for it."" "	/news/business-62132711

w Jake Wightman decided to cap off 2022, taking the Dulwich 5km fun run crown in 14 minutes and 52 seconds - more than a minute ahead of the next best registered runner, as you would expect.
It was a slightly more leisurely pace than Wightman ran when he took 1500m gold in Oregon in July, when he beat Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen to clinch the title in 3:29.23.
It is not the first time Wightman has treated runners at a local parkrun, having also won the race in Bushy Park on 24 December.

sports	Commonwealth Games 2022: Badminton player Kirsty Gilmour's letter to her 16-year-old self	"Hey Kirsty! You're 16 and in your final year of high school. It feels like the end of something but, let me tell you, this is very much just the start. The start of so much. 
wo-time Scottish badminton medallist Kirsty Gilmour will be taking part in her fourth Games in Birmingham. BBC Sport asked her to write a letter to her 16-year-old self as she was preparing for her very first....
In this next year alone, you are going to compete in a Commonwealth Games, graduate high school, pass your driving test and start university. And it will all go past in a magnificent blur until you are 28, sitting in your flat, trying to think back and reflect on it all.
You are in that perfect spot where you feel like an adult and a child all at once. 
Your journey to Delhi won't start at the airport but at the information and kit day. You will be sitting in a lecture theatre with 300 other athletes and be bombarded with more information than your little brain can handle. Then the good bit: the kit. Fresh and smart. It will all feel a little surreal right now and, to be honest, it will continue to.
After the awkward picture by the front door with your new kit on and your bags packed, it will be time for your mum to drop you at the airport. Savour this because soon someone dropping you off will require them to take out a bank loan. 
Now the real journey begins. In a few years, you will be raging at having a middle seat for a 15-hour journey but you won't bat an eyelid. You're just buzzing to be there. Plus, the athlete to your right is some kind of big deal, apparently. Eilidh Child? I wonder if she ever made it?
u'll arrive in beautiful, vibrant, colourful India. The furthest you've ever travelled to play badminton. And it will be great. I promise. You'll be nervous, but not too nervous. You'll play some good games, some not so good games. You'll start to see what professional behaviours look like, and some not so professional ones. 
But you have one job: to play as much badminton as possible. You'll play singles, doubles and mixed and you'll learn a lot. No-one is counting on you to win a medal. Zero expectation and minimum pressure. Enjoy it now because that won't last long...
One overriding memory you'll take away from these Games is the kindest of one of your team-mates, Emma. You'll have a couple of rough days mentally and she'll be unnecessarily generous and kind. It will take more than a decade for you to say thank you when you cross paths at the Tokyo Olympics, but that won't even be on your radar yet.
Now that Delhi has rattled past in a glorious tornado of colour, you'll have found your feet a little. Or so you think. Let me tell you about Glasgow 2014...
So you are 20. You've started traveling the world playing tournaments. You're in university. You've moved out of home. You kind of know what you're doing. You are No.17 in the world and seeded No.2 for the Commonwealth Games. Cool. 
Glasgow is alight. The whole place is buzzing. You will never experience the city like this again. It's incredible. Blazing sunshine, food, music, arts, culture festivals... it's a vibe.
But gradually over the next few weeks your world will become very small. Every part of your life will be entangled in a Games web. Your friends are in the team, your relationship is in the team, your other friends and family are coming to watch, and you're only 15 minutes away from home. But you don't really realise this. You're still quite naive.
will be both the absolute best thing as it will protect you from so much, and also the absolute worst thing as it will affect your performance. But you'll learn some monumental lessons. They'll hurt, but you'll be glad they happened.
In these Games, you will have one of your proudest moments and biggest regrets all within 24 outrageous hours.
Let's start with the good bit. You're going to get a medal. I know! Congrats! And the even better news is you'll do it in an incredible manner. 
You'll win the first set of the semi-final against Tee Jing Yi from Malaysia, but will be 11-19 down in the second. Uh-oh. But then you'll take 10 straight points, throw your racket in the air, fall to the floor and cry. A spot in the final and a medal are secure.
But here's the thing. You'll think you're amazing, that you've got the job done. You are the last Scot standing and while your team-mates are out ""decompressing"", you spend the rest of the day and night scrolling Twitter. 
""Omg, totes incredible @kirstgilmourr"", ""unbelievable match, you're amazing"". 
re will be hundreds of variations of that. And, hey, who doesn't want to read that? I get it. But it's detrimental to your performance in the final the next day. You relax too much and the fire is gone. You think you've already won but, let me tell you, maybe not immediately, but in one, two or three years that silver medal is going to sting.
Looking back, you'll not blame anyone in particular. This is maybe the first Games where social media was starting to take off. We didn't get any advice around it and no-one really knew the effects it could have. But I wish someone had helped you through those 24 hours better and slapped that phone out of your hand. 
I think the people forgot you were only 20. But you learned one hell of a lesson. And you'll rarely make that mistake again.
Winning Scotland's 53rd and final medal of the Games was amazing, despite all that. It was one of your biggest learning experiences. Want me to tell you about Gold Coast 2018..?
You're 23 now. You own a house, and you've been to an Olympics. You've been round the block once or twice but these Games are going to require you to draw on every single bit of that experience.
You've done the kit day, you've done your training, you've chosen your window seat and you're on your way for a third time. You'll feel a nice buzz to this Games. It feels big and important. And it will be.
You'll arrive at the village after 26 hours of travel, looking forward to some food and a lie down. Someone will point at a building and say, ""this is your home for the next four weeks"". 
Like Sam Neill standing up in that jeep in Jurassic Park, you'll take your sunglasses off, eyes wide and jaw-dropped at the sight of a 15-foot high poster of yourself decorating the front of your new flat. Well, this is new.
minton squad will quickly earn the reputation of the team that sit out in the sun too much. And it's fair. We play a year-round indoor sport. We have pasty legs and a Vitamin D deficiency. Let us have this! 
We put up a good fight in the team event and you reach the semi-final of the individual competition when your last-eight opponent withdraws after falling in the first set. You're left with adrenaline coursing through your body but with no outlet. You spend the next few minutes tingling but you're within sight of another medal.
You will be going in fresh against former World No.1 and Commonwealth gold medallist Saina Nehwal from India. Leaving you out of the singles in the team event was a good tactical decision. The last time you played her it was close. And it's close again this time but you lose 21-17 in the third set. 
Ooft. So what now? This will be a truly unique situation in your career. Lose a match in the morning then play another in the afternoon to win a major medal.
where the lesson from four years ago in Glasgow comes in. Your best friend today will be Simon. You know Simon. Tall guy, calming influence? You've been working on psychology together for the last three years? That's him! 
You will be glued to each other for the next five hours. He will get you through this. You'll go to the village together, eat (if you can), grab a smoothie and return to the venue. You will pester him with your every thought and he will tell you, ""Treat this like any other match. You're prepared for this. Just concentrate on yourself"". And every variation of that sentiment. 
You'll take a deep breath and walk out to face Michelle Li, who you lost the Glasgow final against four years earlier. Your nerves will be buzzing, but so are hers. Now here's the kicker... I have no other advice for you because I only remember the very last point. 
You will stand shuttle in hand at 20-16 and decide on a high, forehand serve. Michelle will have to just go all out for it. You've all but dragged the match away from her. She will play a full power, cross-court smash to your forehand but, before you can reach it, it hits the floor. Your head will jolt round to look at the line judge, who will throw their arms wide to signify it was out. And you will have done it. Bronze medal acquired. 
I bet your mum and pregnant sister who will be in the crowd will have a wee cry right about now. The warmest, most satisfying wave of relief will absorb you. You will celebrate with team-mates, hug friends and gaze at that medal while standing on the podium with a Saltire around your shoulders. That's the good news.
ws is that you will spend the majority of the next week crying. Sorry kid! This one has emotionally wrecked you. Leaving the village, flying home, seeing your friends and family again after four weeks... tears, tears, tears. It will be pretty out of character, but that's the Commonwealth Games for you.
Reflecting back, on the precipice of Games number four, I realise what that tension was in Gold Coast. It didn't really feel like a good, excited tension for you. It felt like a kind of grey, desperate, edge-of-seat kind of tension. And it's maybe only now that I realise why. 
You were absolutely adamant to prove - to yourself and others - that Glasgow was not a fluke. To show you can repeatedly bring that kind of quality and back up good performances with even better ones is what will fuel your fire through many, many years. It's still what will keep you going now.
So here we are at Birmingham 2022. We've got the kit, we've done the training, now all we've got to do is go and back up those good performances you've been giving lately. 
Oh, and maybe do a few extra shoulder stability exercises before this one. There's going to be a big Saltire with your name on it for the opening ceremony...
Good luck!"	/sport/commonwealth-games/62098193
health	Warning Somerset GP agency spend is 'not sustainable'	"f an organisation that provides GP services has warned a chronic reliance on expensive agency staff is ""not sustainable"".
Symphony Healthcare Services (SHS) had to spend £3m on locum GPs in the past financial year across Somerset.
Medical director Dr Berge Balian warned ""difficult decisions will have to be made"" without improved funding. 
Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said there are 2,300 more GPs since 2019. 
But the Royal College of GPs does not recognise that figure, and said GP numbers had fallen by 713 fully qualified full-time equivalent positions since 2019. 
Commons Health Select Committee has itself said general practice is in crisis.
Dr Balian added: ""I think most people would recognise it is currently in crisis."" 
When SHS started in 2016, it took over three GP surgeries that could not attract enough partners to run them as a private business. 
Since then it has employed more and more salaried GPs to work in 16 surgeries across 20 locations in Somerset and Devon, with all rated good or outstanding by the Care Quality Commission. 
But over the years it has had to rely more heavily on expensive agency GPs that cost up to £1,000 a shift. 
And because SHS is owned by Yeovil hospital, this has contributed to a £12m spend on agency staff last year.
Dr Balian is a GP at Crewkerne Health Centre and said many doctors are retiring early because their job has become too stressful.
""In the last three years the number of consultations general practice has done in the country has increased by two million while the number of GPs has dropped by 1,800 roughly.
""You can see why it ends up being a significant pressure on those GPs who are responsible for managing that contract and caring for patients under that contract.""
Dr Balian also said there is a financial incentive for GPs to move away from being partners to work as locum doctors because they can earn more than £1,000 a day and also benefit from being in the NHS pension scheme. 
SHS spent £3m on GP locums in the year 2021-22 and Dr Balian said expanding further, with a bigger agency staff bill, is not sustainable. 
He said: ""If you look at general practice, demand is increasing, its capacity is reducing, its funding in real terms is also reducing.
""The only solution to that is either increasing the amount of funding into GPs, or you say actually, nationally we will make a decision that GPs that used to provide this amount of service can only provide this amount of service and that bit needs to be done elsewhere.""
Since it started SHS has set up a new model for family medicine which relies heavily on health coaches, physios and pharmacists to relieve pressure.
Mary Guppy is one of a growing number of ""health coaches"" employed by SHS to support vulnerable patients living in their home.
One of her regulars, Ivan Down, 81, is at risk of having to leave his home in Crewkerne to be admitted to hospital because he has dementia, and diabetes.
Mrs Guppy says an important part of her role is to look after carers, such as Ivan's 71-year-old wife Patricia.
Mrs Guppy said: ""Without Pat, we'd have to find some more care for Ivan, but thanks to her hard work and liaising with the health coaches we can go back to the GPs if there are any health concerns so we can keep him safe in his own environment and keep him well.""
A spokesman for the DHSC said: ""Supporting and growing the workforce is one of the Health and Social Care Secretary's priorities and there are over 2,300 more doctors in general practice compared to 2019, while a record 4,000 trainees have accepted a GP training place this year.
""We have taken action to promote NHS staff banks, which are managed by trusts and allow healthcare professionals to take up temporary shifts. 
""This reduces the requirement for agency staff, and as a consequence agency spend has dropped by a third since 2016.""

EE and Vodafone customers between Holland Park and Queensway stations can get coverage in ticket halls, platforms and in the tunnels.
Northern line between Kentish Town and Archway will follow next week.
ransport for London (TfL) says it will be ""fully connecting"" the whole Tube network by 2024.
Phone networks Three UK and Virgin Media O2 are also taking part in the 4G and 5G-ready rollout, with customers gaining access in the new year.
Central and Northern line stations Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road and Camden Town will also follow in the new year. 
Previously, the only underground tunnels to get phone coverage were on the eastern half of the Jubilee line between Westminster and Canning Town.
Once fully delivered, more than 2,000km of cabling and thousands of radios are expected to be installed within tunnels and stations.

technology	Cambridge University study says robots may help children open up	"Robots could help identify mental wellbeing issues in children, a study has suggested.
Cambridge University researchers used a child-sized humanoid robot to complete a series of mental health questionnaires with 28 children aged between eight and 13.
found some children were more willing to confide in the robot than in person or in an online questionnaire.
researchers said they hoped to expand their study further.
re presenting the results at a conference in Italy.
Micol Spitale, one of the authors of the study, said they did not have any intention of replacing psychologists or other mental health professionals with robots ""since their expertise far surpasses anything a robot can do"".
But, their research suggested robots ""could be a useful tool in helping children to open up and share things they might not be comfortable sharing at first"", she said.
During the study, each child took part in a one-to-one, 45-minute session with a Nao robot - a humanoid robot about 60cm (24in) tall.
A parent or guardian, as well as members of the research team, observed from an adjacent room.
Before each session, the children and their parent or guardian completed standard online questionnaires to assess the child's mental wellbeing.
Participants then interacted with the robot by speaking with it, or by touching sensors on the robot's hands and feet.
Additional sensors tracked participants' heartbeat, head and eye movements during the session.
research team said all of the participants had told them they enjoyed talking to the robots, and some shared information which they had not shared either in person or in the online questionnaire.
""Since the robot we use is child-sized, and completely non-threatening, children might see the robot as a confidante - they feel like they won't get into trouble if they share secrets with it,"" said PhD student Nida Itrat Abbasi.
results are being presented at the 31st Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication in Naples.

Scots are one of 35 teams - each consisting of two female and two male athletes - at the week-long event, which begins in Aberdeen on Saturday.
Bryce won bronze when the tournament - cancelled the last two years because of Covid-19 and scheduling issues - was held in Russia in 2016.

entertainment	The Traitors: Why viewers became so loyal to the BBC reality series	"Depending on your television diet, your favourite reality competition might take place in a Spanish villa, the Australian jungle, a Hertfordshire ballroom, or a giant tent filled with ovens and self-raising flour.
But recently, an increasing number of viewers have instead been escaping to a Scottish castle with Claudia Winkleman and 22 members of the public who just want to avoid being murdered.
Fortunately, the murders committed in BBC One's The Traitors are metaphorical, but the bloodless backstabbing has nonetheless inspired a fiercely devoted following since the series launched in late November.
""It's got a fresh formula which nobody else has really done,"" says Harrison Brocklehurst, pop culture writer for the Tab. ""And in a time when a lot of reality TV has blurred into one, all following the same formulas with who they cast, I think the Traitors really stands out as unique. 
""They have a really wide range of ordinary people, different ages, races, sexualities, it makes for a real smorgasbord of personalities. What's made it so fun is it's always the people you don't really expect who have played a blinder.""
format sees the players gathered at Ardross Castle in the Scottish Highlands. Upon arrival, three of them are told secretly, via a squeeze on the shoulder from Winkleman, that they are traitors.
m is for the other contestants - known as faithfuls - to root out the traitors, provided they can survive themselves. The traitors can ""murder"" one player every night, removing them from the game.
A possible jackpot of £120,000 can be won by the faithfuls who make it to the end. However, if any traitors make it to the final undetected, they take all the money instead. The concept is delicious, and makes for addictive viewing.
format was developed by Dutch producer IDTV and broadcaster RTL and the original version, De Verraders, launched last year. RTL's director of content, Peter van der Vorst, says the initial idea was pitched to them three years ago, which they began developing.
""We played it with my management team in my back yard. And it worked!"" he recalls to BBC News. ""Within seconds the whole dynamics within the team changed. We ordered it on the spot.""
He adds he is ""really enthusiastic"" about the BBC's version. ""In the Netherlands we played it with celebrities, in Britain you do it with unknown people which works really well too,"" he says. 
""So that could be an inspiration. Our British colleagues also added some game elements that will be useful to us.""
It's clear from the prime-time scheduling the BBC has confidence in the UK adaptation. But the corporation's director of unscripted Kate Phillips, who brought it to British screens, tells BBC News: ""Every time you take a new show, it is a punt, because there's no guarantee it is going to work. 
""I don't think there was any doubt that the series would be good, but because the television landscape is so competitive now, the only worry I had was, 'Will it break through?'""
Catch-up viewing has played a key role in the show's momentum. ""We knew it would be word-of-mouth, we wanted people to talk about it and pass it on and that's what's happened, it's a grower,"" Phillips says.
raitors maintains a constant air of suspicion even as bonds start to form between the players, nearly all of whom have huge personalities. Nobody gets through a sentence uninterrupted; the atmosphere is one of chaos and tension.
In the absence of concrete evidence, the contestants come up with theories based on each other's real-life jobs, facial expressions, body language and behaviour during the physical challenges.
Amanda in particular has become the show's breakout star. Assigned a traitor in the opening episode, she left viewers awestruck by skilfully using her kind nature and lilting Welsh accent to mask her deceit. 
format feels fresh, yet familiar - as if several successful reality show concepts have been combined. The contestants spend their days in close quarters, much like Big Brother, while the outdoor physical tasks are reminiscent of I'm A Celebrity.
""Inevitably, there will be a few [familiar] things,"" says Phillips. ""You might think 'Oh I've seen a task a bit like that before', but I think nobody has ever seen a show quite like this. I think partly that's because of the gothic melodrama, the capes, the fires, the night time, make it feel very distinctive.""
Plus, the core game itself is recognisable to viewers. It is similar to card games such as Mafia or Werewolf. Camilla Long of the Sunday Times likened it to wink murder.
""The main crux of the game is familiar to different people,"" says Brocklehurst. ""I did theatre at university and college and we played a variation of it as a warm-up game.""
Some viewers have even been throwing Traitors viewing parties, where friends gather together to play the game themselves before watching the latest episode.
Reviews have been increasingly positive as the show has progressed. The Guardian's Rebecca Nicholson said: ""The BBC has waited until the end of the year to slide out what is turning into one of its most exciting series in ages.
""On paper, it sounds perfectly fine if relatively tepid. Cut to three weeks later and I am watching each episode with multiple text chats on the go, as if in charge of an air traffic control tower at Heathrow. This is masterly reality TV.""
Independent's Isobel Lewis was more restrained, writing: ""The Traitors definitely isn't a perfect reality show, or even the best in its genre right now, but it is pretty entertaining.""
Its viewing figures paint a mixed picture. The opening episode attracted 2.9 million viewers - a respectable but not outstanding figure.
It has, however, grown its following via iPlayer, with many viewers racing to catch up as word has spread. The first episode has now been seen by five million viewers. More complete data will become available in the coming weeks. 
rice-weekly broadcast rollout means The Traitors is a less overwhelming proposition than others. ""It doesn't have the intensity of Love Island, which is on six nights a week,"" says Brocklehurst. 
He suggests social media has stimulated catch-up viewing. ""The memes and everyone live-tweeting it has played a big part in its success. Nobody wants to miss out on a reality TV show that everyone is talking about.""
Phillips agrees, adding: ""When I'm looking at a new show, the other thing I always say is 'What are the Gogglebox moments?' 
""So if I was watching that show, would there be several moments that would give me a strong reaction? Would it be a show that would make it on Gogglebox because it would be a gift to all those people responding?""
It's perhaps telling that The Traitors has indeed featured heavily on Gogglebox (which is also made by Studio Lambert, the production company behind the British adaptation of The Traitors).
Many viewers are enjoying seeing a darker side to Winkleman, who initially turned down hosting the show until producers showed her the Dutch series.
""They sent me it. My kids did not get fed, I didn't brush my teeth, I watched the Dutch version weeping because I loved it so much,"" she told Graham Norton.
""Every other game show is about luck or about general knowledge. This is purely a game of charm, nous, of being wily.""
Philips, who has worked with Winkleman for many years, says: ""I think Claudia's a perfect host. We're seeing another side to her, she's got that wit and that drollness, but she is a tough Claudia, she can be a bit severe and scary, and she genuinely cares about the show and its contestants.""
re is a noticeable difference with the contestants on other shows, notes Brocklehurst. ""It doesn't feel like people are in there to become influencers,"" he says. ""I think the public are a bit over that.""
rs' entertaining reaction to the twists and turns of the game can be credited to ""the joy of the first series"", suggests Phillips.
""It's like when Big Brother first launched,"" she says. ""These contestants are coming to it new and they're not sure what's going to happen.""
""Already we're thinking that if we do have a second series, they will have to cast it a bit differently, because contestants will be coming to it with more knowledge."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63970819

business	TSB fined £49m over IT system meltdown	"SB has been fined nearly £49m for an IT meltdown in 2018 that caused chaos and left its customers unable to access online accounts for several weeks.
UK's financial regulator said the failings were ""widespread and serious"" and led to ""significant disruption"".
roblems began in April 2018 when an attempt to move data to a new computer system went wrong.
All areas of TSB's services were affected, including branch, telephone and online banking.
roblems were not fully resolved for eight months and ""a significant proportion of its 5.2 million customers were affected by the initial issues"", the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said.
It led to the departure of the bank's then chief executive Paul Pester.
Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: ""The failings in this case were widespread and serious which had a real impact on the day-to-day lives of a significant proportion of TSB's customers, including those who were vulnerable.""
FCA said TSB had paid £32.7m in compensation to customers who were affected by the problems.
SB chief executive Robin Bulloch said: ""We'd like to apologise again to TSB customers who were impacted by issues following the technology migration in 2018. We worked hard to put things right for customers then and have since transformed our business.""
roblems were triggered when TSB tried to move 1.3 billion customer records from an old system run by its former parent bank, Lloyds, to one managed by its current Spanish owner, Sabadell.
However, it proved disastrous with many customers being locked out of their accounts and some customers being given access to the confidential records of others.
Cases included people trying to complete house purchases and unsure whether they could move in. The BBC spoke to one couple who sat with a loaded removal van outside their new home waiting for funds to be released.
Another couple who were locked out of their wedding savings were forced to grovel to their DJ and wedding car provider because they were unable to pay them as the big day approached.
Businesses were also left in difficulty. Lee MacDonald, who played Zammo in children's TV show Grange Hill in the 1980s, told BBC Radio 5 live that he was ""having an absolute nightmare"" in his locksmith business.
Shortly after the issues emerged, Mr Pester admitted to the BBC that the bank was ""on our knees"".
roblems continued for many weeks and TSB came under fierce criticism for the IT failings. Mr Pester was directly, and unusually, criticised by MPs for the saga. 
FCA said while data itself was transferred successfully, the IT platform ""immediately experienced technical failures"".
""This resulted in significant disruption to the continuity of TSB's banking services, including branch, telephone, online and mobile banking,"" it said.
Mr Steward added: ""The firm failed to plan for the IT migration properly, the governance of the project was insufficiently robust and the firm failed to take reasonable care to organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems.""
SB was fined a total of £48.65m - made up of a £29.75m penalty from the FCA and a fine of £18.9m from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA).
""The disruption to continuity of service experienced by TSB during its IT migration fell below the standard we expect banks to meet,"" said Sam Woods, the PRA's chief executive.
In February 2019, TSB said that the disastrous IT upgrade had cost it £330m, and about 80,000 customers had switched their account away from the bank in 2018.
mplexity of the switchover and the problems it caused has meant a long investigation and eventual fine by the regulator. In the meantime, there has been significant reputational damage for the bank."	/news/business-64036529
entertainment	Leicester breast cancer patient's art focuses on hope	"A woman who is among a group of artists whose work is featured in an upcoming exhibition has described how painting helped her focus on hope while she was undergoing cancer treatment.
Laura Dampney, from Leicester, was 35 when she was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer.
Breast Cancer and Me exhibition is taking place at the Angear Visitor Centre at Lakeside Arts in University Park, Nottingham.
It will run from 8-30 October.
Ms Dampney said she had wanted to create memories for her children in case she did not survive. 
""I wanted to create art for them to remember me by and to have around the house, art with a positive message,"" she said.
""I have a strong faith and I wanted to create pictures that represented hope and joy and good things for them to remember as they grow older and as they inevitably face difficult times.""
39-year-old underwent a mastectomy in November 2018 and began the first of six courses of chemotherapy in January 2019 to reduce the chances of the cancer returning. 
She said she was now looking forward to celebrating her 40th birthday, as it was a milestone she had not known if she would reach.
She added she felt very honoured that two of her artworks would feature in the exhibition. 
xhibition has been curated by the Breast Cancer Research Centre (NBCRC) at the University of Nottingham.
It will feature 15 artists who will present their experiences of breast cancer through visual pieces. 
Deputy director of NBCRC, Dr Andy Green said: ""We are incredibly grateful to all the artists.
""Incidence rates for breast cancer are expected to rise 2% in the next 12 years and there continues to be a real need to continue our research and increase awareness of breast cancer.""
Carol Pairaudeau, the administrator of the centre who curated the exhibition, said: ""I am looking forward to the opening of Breast Cancer and Me and showcasing this amazing artwork to the public.""

technology	Driverless cars: Experts warn no easy answer to how safe they should be	"re is no easy answer as to how safe self-driving cars should be, an adviser to a new government-backed report has told the BBC.
report, from the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, warns that it might not be enough for self-driving cars to be safer than normal cars.
It says the public may have little tolerance for driverless car crashes - even if they are safer on average.
It comes as the government sets out its plans for self-driving cars. 
No self-driving cars are currently allowed on UK roads, but the government has now said the first such vehicles could be on UK roads by 2025.
Some cars, coaches and lorries with self-driving features could even be operating on motorways in the next year, the Department for Transport said.
government's plans include a ""safety ambition"" for vehicles: that they should be as safe as a competent human driver. 
It says this will inform standards that need to be reached in order to be allowed to self-drive on the roads - and manufacturers could face sanctions if they are not met.
But the CDEI, a government expert body that leads its work on trustworthy innovation using data and AI, says the question of how safe autonomous vehicles should be is not one science alone can answer.
It says the public may have little tolerance for crashes that are seen as the fault of ""faceless technology companies or lax regulation"" even if, it adds, on average driverless cars are safer than humans.
And if the public expect self-driving cars to be as safe as trains or planes, it would require a 100-fold increase in average safety over manually driven cars, it warns.
""What we wanted to do was say there's not an easy answer to this question"" said Professor Jack Stilgoe of University College London who advised the CDEI. He suggested that establishing how safe they should be was a democratic decision.
CDEI says it is also important to consider how risk is distributed between different groups. Even if there are improvements in overall safety, ""some groups may see substantial safety improvements while others see none or even face new hazards"".
report advises that other risks will need scrutiny as the technology is rolled out.
One is the potential for bias in algorithms controlling the cars.
It warns that some groups, such as wheelchair users, may be underrepresented in data used to train the software algorithms which control the cars - potentially causing bias.
report also says that self-driving cars should be clearly identified, and that ""people have a right to know what sort of agents they are sharing the road with"".
An academic survey quoted by the CDEI in the report suggested that 86% of the public agreed with this.
Professor Stilgoe said there were also serious moral questions about how the testing of self-driving vehicles is conducted on public roads, as other road users could in effect become participants in these trials whether they liked it or not.
""There is something quite important about the ethical principle of informed consent,"" he said. 
gy might result in pressure to alter roads and the rules of the road to suit self-driving cars. 
Professor Stilgoe said these needed to be debated and discussed transparently.
""The danger is sort of sleepwalking in to a world in which these changes happen in order to suit one mode of transport - and the benefits then don't get spread very widely,"" he said.
On Friday, the government is publishing a policy paper setting out planned laws ready for the introduction of self-driving vehicles on British roads.
w laws will be brought forward when parliamentary time allows, the government has said. 
gislation is expected to state that manufacturers are responsible for the vehicle's actions when self-driving - something the Law Commission recommended earlier this year.
In April, proposed updates to the Highway Code were announced that would allow drivers to watch entertainment on a car's screen while the vehicle was self-driving. 
Initially this would likely be whilst the vehicle was driving at slow speed on a motorway, such as in congested traffic.
Vehicles that can drive themselves on motorways could be available to purchase within the next year, the government reiterated.
government has also repeated its goal of a wider rollout of self-driving technologies by 2025 and £100m of funding for industry and research.
m Research, the motor insurers' automotive research centre, welcomed the government's ambition but warned ""complete clarity around the driver's legal responsibilities"" was needed, along with transparency on how the technology is marketed, ""how the dealer describes systems when handing over the keys and how the self-driving system itself communicates with the driver""."	/news/technology-62598618
health	Lung cancer detected earlier through screening trial, NHS trust says	"A city hospital has detected 10 lung cancer patients through a screening programme that it is hoped offers a better chance of a cure.
More than 40 areas in England are trialling checks for current and former smokers aged 55-74.
Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust said it picked up 80% of suspected cancers at a curable stage, compared to 30% before.
Respiratory consultant Dr Alexander Hicks said the results were a ""complete game-changer"" for patients.
Former smoker John Rochester, 74, from Portsmouth, said he was contacted within 24 hours of his positive scan.
He said: ""I never had shortness of breath, anything like that. I never realised I had cancer. 
""If I hadn't gone for the test, I could have quite well passed away tomorrow. You just don't know.
""I can't believe how successful it has been, to be perfectly honest. Just over the moon.""
Dr Alexander Hicks, the trust's lung cancer lead, said: ""Of people with signs of a lung cancer, 80% of them have been found at a point in time when we can offer them a cure to their illness, which is a complete game-changer for me in my role as a lung cancer doctor.
""I usually see only 30 or so per cent of people when they are still able to be cured of their lung cancer.""
NHS England said the Targeted Lung Health Check programme, currently in areas with the highest rates of lung cancer mortality, was expected to cover all areas of the country from 2024.
Lung cancer is the biggest cause of cancer deaths in the UK, accounting for about a fifth of cases.
Symptoms include a persistent cough, chest infection and breathlessness, although there are usually no signs in the early stages.

health	Charities warn Rishi Sunak about cost of living crisis suicide risk	"Rishi Sunak has been warned about the impact the cost of living crisis is having on mental health and suicide rates. 
In an open letter to the prime minister, 19 charities including the Samaritans and Mind, have urged the prime minister ""to act with speed and compassion to tackle the root causes of destitution"".
People living in the most deprived 10% of areas in the UK are more than twice as likely to die from suicide than those living in the wealthiest 10% of areas, according to the Office for National Statistics.
government has pledged £5.4m funding to over 100 suicide prevention charities to support them to deliver their services.
In addition, £15m has been invested through the Prevention and Promotion for Better Mental Health Fund in 40 local authority areas in the most deprived parts of the country.
In their letter, the charities say they will continue to provide all the support they can but add: ""The first intervention to reduce mental ill health and prevent suicide is to ensure every household has the means to be safe and warm with enough to eat.""
Last year 5,583 suicides were registered in England and Wales which was 6.9% higher than in 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics.
Mental health charities have reported an increase in concerns about money, with the Samaritans saying they were contacted 12,000 times in July alone.  
Mind's Infoline has seen a 40% rise in calls related to money compared with last year.
Some 77% of adults in Great Britain reported feeling very or somewhat worried about the rising costs of living, according to the Sunak warned about hardship suicide rate riskOffice for National Statistics.
Samaritans say that with over 1.5 million people currently on a waiting list for help, the cost of living crisis could put the mental health system ""on the brink of collapse.""
government has had a suicide prevention strategy in place for England since 2012 and in 2019 it launched a cross-government ""workplan"" to coordinate action by the NHS, charities and local government.
Watch: Sajid Javid on losing his brother to suicide
Labour's Shadow Minister for Mental Health, Rosena Allin-Khan has called on the government to ""recommit"" to the strategy.
She added: ""The next Labour government will enshrine a truly preventative approach to mental health, opening mental health hubs in every community.""
In October, Conservative MP Jason McCartney raised the issue on the House of Commons, saying that each death is ""a tragedy for their family, for their friends and their communities.""
Mr McCartney told the BBC: ""I've lost two friends who took their own lives. I think of them regularly.
""Fundamentally I believe we must do more to lower the suicide rate for no other reason than it's in all of our interests to do so.""
He is calling for a Commons debate on how the government can work with charities, like the Samaritans, to achieve the lowest ever recorded suicide rate.
He said: ""Suicide is the biggest killer of young men in Britain today. It needs to be addressed the same way as any other illness.
""I would like to see a recommitment to improving mental health and wellbeing outcomes, particularly for people who experience worse outcomes than the general population.""
former health Secretary, Sajid Javid, has supported a digital suicide prevention service called 'Shout'.
Shout is a free, confidential and 24/7 text messaging support service for anyone who is struggling.
He spoke at an event launching a report that looked at the cost efficacy of the charity ""Shout"" as a suicide prevention service. 
Mr Javid said: ""Every 90 minutes someone loses their life to suicide. This report is not only timely but needed.""
report aims to estimate the number of lives saved by Shout and the cost savings to the UK economy.
Suicide is the most common reason those under 18 text Shout, accounting for 37% of their conversations. 
NHS Five Year Forward View for Mental Health was published in 2016 included a commitment to reduce the rate of suicides in England by 10% by 2020 compared to 2015 levels. 
However, the suicide rate in England in 2020 was almost the same as the 2015 rate.
government have said they understand the negative impact financial troubles can have on a person's mental health.
A government spokesperson said: ""Our Breathing Space scheme has protected over 100,000 people from charges, distressing letters and bailiff visits, giving them time to find a debt solution that works for them. 
""We are already investing £2.3bn a year by 2023/24 into mental health services, meaning an additional 345,000 children and young people will be able to access NHS-funded mental health support they need by 2024.""
government have also provided £79 million in funding to expand children's mental health services. 
Breathing Space scheme protections means people in mental health crisis treatment have legal protections from their creditors, for the full duration of their crisis treatment plus another 30 days. "	/news/uk-politics-63200639
technology	Twitter will ban unlabelled parody accounts, says Elon Musk	"Elon Musk says Twitter accounts engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying they are a parody will be permanently suspended.
witter previously issued a warning before suspending accounts, but there would now be no warning, he announced.
A number of accounts that changed their name to Elon Musk and mocked the billionaire have already been suspended or placed behind a warning sign.
witter's billionaire new owner took over the company late last month.
At the end of last week he laid off around half of the company's workforce.
He has also confirmed plans to allow users to buy blue-tick, verified status.
Detailing the new policy on parody accounts, Mr Musk tweeted: ""Previously, we issued a warning before suspension, but now that we are rolling out widespread verification, there will be no warning."" 
He added that ""any name change at all will cause temporary loss of verified checkmark"".
Several accounts that had changed their name to the new Twitter owner have been suspended or placed behind a warning sign, including those of US comedian Kathy Griffin and former NFL player Chris Kluwe.
Other accounts, including one parodying former US President Donald Trump by comedian Tim Heidecker, are yet to be suspended. 
Mr Musk has previously said he opposed permanent bans on Twitter, including that of Mr Trump's official account. Mr Musk said last week that banned accounts would not be reinstated until there was ""a clear process for doing so"". He pointed out that he was not banning an account that followed his private plane.
New York Times reported on Sunday that Twitter was delaying the rollout of verification check marks to subscribers of its new service until after Tuesday's US midterm elections. At the weekend, the social media site's website app began offering an update that will charge $8 (£7) a month for its blue, verified checkmark.
On Friday, the billionaire said Twitter was losing more than $4m per day, insisting that this gave him ""no choice"" over culling around half the company's 7,500-strong workforce.
uts - as well as Mr Musk's fierce advocacy of free speech - have caused speculation that Twitter could water down its efforts on content moderation. 
However, Mr Musk has insisted that the firm's stance towards harmful material remains ""absolutely unchanged"". UN human rights chief Volker Turk wrote him an open letter, warning that Twitter had a responsibility to avoid amplifying harmful content."	/news/technology-63539617
technology	US seizes stolen funds from suspected North Korean hackers	"US Department of Justice has seized $500,000 (£417,000) worth of Bitcoin from suspected North Korean hackers.
kers attacked healthcare providers with a new strain of ransomware, extorting the funds from several organisations.
US authorities say they have already returned ransom payments to two hospital groups.
rare successful seizure comes as US authorities warn that North Korea is becoming a major ransomware threat.
In a conference on Tuesday, Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco praised an unnamed Kansas hospital for alerting the FBI early about the ransomware attack.
""Not only did this allow us to recover their ransom payment as well as a ransom paid by previously unknown victims, but we were also able to identify a previously unidentified ransomware strain,"" she said.
According to court documents, hackers used the ransomware strain called Maui to encrypt the files and servers of a medical centre in Kansas in May 2021.
, ransomware hackers will use malicious software to scramble data or lock users out of the system until a ransom is paid.
Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work?
Kansas hospital spent a week not being able to access its IT systems, then decided to pay approximately $100,000 in Bitcoin to regain the use of its computers and equipment.
It is not illegal to pay hacker ransoms, but it is discouraged by law enforcement organisations around the world.
FBI says it was swiftly notified about the payment by the medical centre, which meant officers were able to identify the never-before-seen ransomware linked to North Korea and trace the cryptocurrency to China-based money launderers.
Agents were also able to identify another $120,000 Bitcoin payment made to one of the criminal cryptocurrency accounts. This turned out to be a medical provider in Colorado which had just paid a ransom after also being hacked by the Maui ransomware criminals.
FBI says it has returned the money to the two healthcare providers, but has not said from where the rest of the seized funds have come.
It is not known how the FBI was able to seize the funds but Tom Robinson, founder and chief scientist of Elliptic, which analyses Bitcoin payments, told the BBC the seizure may have come about as the hackers tried to exchange their Bitcoin to traditional currency. 
""It's likely that the investigators were able to trace the cryptocurrency to an exchange platform, where the launderers would have sent the funds in order to cash out. Exchanges are regulated businesses and can seize their customers' funds if compelled to do so by law enforcement,"" he said.
""Another possibility is that the cryptocurrency was seized directly from the launderers' own wallet. This is more challenging to do as it would require access to the wallet's private key - a passcode that allows cryptocurrency in a wallet to be accessed and moved.""
US authorities are increasingly using new tactics to steal back extorted funds from cyber-criminals operating in jurisdictions like North Korea and Russia, where law enforcement agencies do not co-operate with Western requests for assistance.
""These seizures are still very rare, and it highlights the value of speedy reporting of cyber-extortion incidents, and working with law enforcement,"" says Jen Ellis, from cyber-security firm Rapid7.
""They won't be able to recoup the payment in every case, but the more information they have on attacker groups' tactics, techniques, and procedures, the more likely they are to be able to disrupt, deter, and respond to attacks, which benefits everyone.""
Last June, the US recovered most of the $4.4m ransom paid by Colonial Pipeline to a cyber-criminal gang thought to be based in Russia.
In November 2021, the US also clawed back $6m from another ransomware gang called REvil with heavy links to Russia. 
As well as traditional state espionage elements, North Korea has for many years been accused of directing hacks aimed at making money for the pariah state.
North Korean hacking activity is often attributed to the so-called Lazarus Group of hackers, which has been accused of attempting to take $1bn from a Bangladesh bank in 2016. 
In the last year, the group has been linked to lucrative attacks on cryptocurrency platforms, but last month the US cyber-authorities issued a warning about North Korean hackers launching ransomware attacks against US hospitals.
uthorities did not provide evidence that North Korea was behind the attacks, but the joint Cybersecurity Advisory assessment of the Maui ransomware stated that it had been ""used by North Korean state-sponsored cyber-actors since at least May 2021 to target healthcare organisations."""	/news/technology-62239638
health	Social-care insurance scheme needed, David Cameron says	"ry governments have failed to cut the ""catastrophic costs"" of social care and should now look at an ""insurance intervention"", David Cameron has said. 
former prime minister told BBC News his government ""looked at, but couldn't crack"" the issue of people having to sell their homes in old age. 
A cap on the amount people in England pay for their social care was due to be introduced in October 2023. 
But this was postponed for two years in the chancellor's autumn statement. 
Jeremy Hunt blamed concerns over staffing and financial pressures on health and social-care services.
uded a more generous means test and a lifetime cap on personal care costs of £86,000.
was first proposed by economist Sir Andrew Dilnot in 2011.  
Mr Cameron, president of Alzheimer's Research UK, told the BBC's Newscast podcast: ""The problem governments keep coming across is that while the Dilnot cap...  is a very good idea, it does tend to benefit relatively better-off households.
""If I had any advice for my successors now - and I try to keep my interventions to a minimum because their jobs are hard enough without ex-prime ministers giving a running commentary - I think looking again, if there isn't some sort of insurance intervention where we can help people protect against the catastrophic costs of selling their home to pay for care, I think that might be a good place to look.""
Delaying the introduction of the cap means some people will continue to pay more than £86,000 for their lifetime care needs.
government said an extra £2.8bn would be available for adult social care next year and £4.7bn the following year.
Health Secretary Stephen Barclay said 200,000 more care packages would be delivered. 
Councils had warned adult care services could deteriorate unless the rollout was postponed. 
But Sir Andrew said the delay was ""extraordinarily disappointing"", accusing Mr Hunt of breaking the Conservatives' 2019 manifesto commitment to fix social care.
Mr Cameron spoke to Newscast on the day health experts and charities welcomed a new drug treatment for Alzheimer's as a ground-breaking moment in the fight against the disease. 
Lecanemab is the first drug to slow the brain's destruction - after decades of failed trials.
Mr Cameron said: ""I've been president of Alzheimer's Research UK for five years now and this, I think, is the happiest day that we've had. 
""One can't overdo the enthusiasm but it feels like a breakthrough and it's very good news. 
""It will also just push forward a lot more research and a lot more enthusiasm.
""This will really generate some enthusiasm from pharmaceutical companies, from scientists, from all those that we need to work so hard.""
Mr Cameron, whose mother, Mary, has Alzheimer's, said: ""It's a very tough thing for families. You see someone with their memory just slowly being eaten away at by one of these diseases of the brain.
""We're a country of 60 million people. Soon, we're going to have a million people with dementia. It's going to be the most costly health condition. 
""It's going to be the biggest cause of of death. But far from the statistics, it's just going to be a tragedy for so many families. And I've seen that with my own family.""

technology	Can the right smell make you more productive?	"Yaniv Mama holds a pot of cigarette butts under my nose.
""I presume you don't like the odour?"" he says, watching me wince.
He then waves a small white stick next to my face. ""Now, smell the pot again, what do you smell?""
garette stench has disappeared, no matter how hard and how close to the pot of butts I sniff.
ffect is down to technology developed by Israeli firm Moodify. Their technique involves activating receptors in the olfactory bulb, the part of the brain that processes smell. 
""It turns out that smell has its own spectrum [like the visible light spectrum], and if you spread odour molecules equally across it, you get a malodour control effect without having an unpleasant mixture of bad smell and cheap perfume,"" says Mr Mama, the company's founder and chief technology officer.
Moodify sells a pendant that can be hung near a cat litter box to eliminate any unwanted smells.
""We realised in Israel that because apartments tend to be small and rented, with less outside space so the litter is in the living room, people were almost desperate for a solution,"" says Mr Mama.
With more of us spending more time working from home, it is not surprising that people are paying more attention to how their home smells.
In the UK, The White Company has seen a surge in sales of scented candles, which it says is down to more home working.
""Scent is such a personal thing because we all have different tastes, but it really does have the power to change the feel of a room and therefore how you feel when you enter,"" says Chrissie Rucker, founder of The White Company.
As well as making the environment more pleasant, there is some evidence that the right scent can boost your brain.
Mark Moss is the head of the Department of Psychology at Northumbria University. He has studied the effect of essential oils on performance. One of his main findings is that the rosemary aroma can enhance memory.
""I have also done some work showing beneficial effects of sage and peppermint, also on cognition. 
""By comparison, lavender tends to impair memory and slow down reaction time. [But] research by others have shown it to be useful in reducing pre-treatment anxiety in dental and medical situations,"" he says.
More technology of business:
Dr Moss highlights the prominence of scent receptors in the brain.
״The olfactory bulb has many more projections to many more structures in the brain than do vision or hearing. This shows how important it has been in our evolution.
״Much of the impact of smells on behaviour is unconscious. We don't actively process the information that smells present, especially for low level smells. We only consciously process smells that are quite strong,"" he says.
Based on more than a decade of research at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, Moodify are developing scents that enable people to improve their performance, enhance their wellbeing and increase their safety.
Weizmann Institute found that paratroopers emitted a smell of fear before they jumped. Scientists are reproducing that scent, saying it could help make people more alert.
While there is no distinct smell of fear, the olfactory receptors can detect volatile molecules in sweat associated with stressful situations.
It's those molecules the scientists are working on.
""Potentially, it will give you better cognitive and psychological performance,"" says Mr Mama.
Dr Moss says there is more to learn about how smells affect us.
""Smell is probably the least understood of all the senses because evolutionarily it has been surpassed by vision and audition in terms of human behaviour,"" he says. 
""It has to some extent been considered a vestige of our evolutionary past rather than something that is still of considerable value.  It is only when it is lost that it is seen as important. It is also very complex in terms of its interaction with the brain.""
Loss of the sense of smell can be very upsetting, agrees Klio Maniati, a chemical engineer and perfumer, who has been a consultant to Moodify.
""Smell is the first sense that a baby knows how to use right after it's born and this is the way it connects to its new surroundings. Through smell we recognise our carers in our earliest stage of life and later on we use it as a social tool,"" she says.
""People that have lost their sense of smell often report fear of socialisation because they are constantly afraid they might smell bad and not know it, or they tend to avoid going to a restaurant because they can't enjoy the food. This makes them less open to forming close contacts with other people.""
Back at the lab Yaniv Mama says the future of creating smells to enhance our lives is limitless. 
""Tailor-made smells such as your favourite scented candle, freshly baked bread or cut grass, even a newborn baby smell could all be sent via an app or TV screen,"" he predicts."	/news/business-61708789
entertainment	Glastonbury Festival may have to review drug testing policy	"Glastonbury Festival might have to change its drug testing policy as part of a review of its licence.
for the event, at Worthy Farm in Somerset, includes a management plan aimed at keeping attendees safe.
As part of the plan, drugs surrendered or confiscated on site are tested by a private company, and overall figures on seizures are not given to the police.
Police called for a policy change, with Mendip councillors agreeing the issue should be explored at a licence review.
Addressing the licensing board at Mendip District Council, Pete Collins, drug expert lead at Avon and Somerset Constabulary, said: ""The festival use the services of a licensed private company to carry out what they call back-of-house testing there.
""Believe it or not, but the seizure of drugs is not something that's disclosed to us - the data is owned by the Glastonbury Festival.""
Under the current system, police will arrest people within the festival site for supplying or attempting to supply drugs - and these figures are recorded within the official police statistics.
However, information about drugs dropped into amnesty bins or seized by festival security staff does not form part of official police investigations.
Councillor Simon Carswell suggested Glastonbury should be compelled to release drug seizure figures as part of its licence, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Mr Collins said that having more security staff on-site - or selling fewer tickets - would lead to more drugs being seized.
Councillor Francis Hayden said he favoured front-of-house testing at festivals, where people could get drugs tested before entering to ensure they were safe.
However, Andy Battle, the Glastonbury Festival head of security, told the board in April that he did not believe such an approach would be effective.
rd agreed to discuss the licence at its next meeting in February.

business	Train strikes: Drivers walk out in pay row	"Rail travel is being disrupted this weekend with train drivers at 11 companies walking out as part of a long-running pay row.
rike by the Aslef union is affecting people travelling to Christmas markets and major sporting events.
Passengers are being advised to check before they travel.
However, strike action at London Overground has been suspended while union members consider a new pay offer.
Aslef, which represents drivers, wants wages to keep pace with the rising cost of living. It said talks with rail firms broke down after no pay offer was made.
""We regret that passengers will be inconvenienced for another day. We don't want to be taking this action,"" said Aslef's general secretary Mick Whelan.
Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said it was ""incredibly frustrated"" that Aslef's leadership had decided to take further strike action.
""We regret Aslef's decision, which will cause real disruption to passengers and hit its members' pay packets,"" a spokesman said.
A Department for Transport spokesperson said that the strike was ""disappointing"" and unproductive, particularly due to its timing during the World Cup football tournament and a busy retail period.
""This dispute has gone on far too long and is not only causing disarray in people's lives, but is harming the economy too. We urge union leaders to reconsider this action and instead work with employers, not against them, to agree a new way forward. The future of our railway depends on it,"" the spokesperson added.
In addition to the 11 companies directly affected by the industrial action, Heathrow Express and London Northwestern Railway are also expected to be affected.
Operators that are not affected will run trains but they may be very busy.
Passengers are being told they should check services before they travel, and to allow extra time for their journey.
Great Western Railway (GWR), which will run only an extremely reduced service on the day, has warned customers travelling to Christmas markets and major sporting events to avoid taking the train.
It said that as a result of the strikes, no GWR trains will serve Bath Spa for the opening Saturday of the city's Christmas market.
Fans heading to Cardiff for Wales' Autumn International against Australia, or to Twickenham to see England take on South Africa, will also face disruption.
rike is clearly having a big impact on people's weekend plans, but Aslef believe there is strong public support for them.
At London Euston, the station is open. The Tube is running as normal, as is the London Overground - after strike action there was suspended at the last minute.
But all other rail services here have been heavily disrupted by today's industrial action and the station is unusually quiet, compared with what you might normally expect on a Saturday afternoon.
g shopping weekend, with Black Friday sales in full swing - ordinarily, there would be lots of people here heading to the shops in central London.
Elsewhere around the country, people travelling to Christmas markets, concerts and sporting events have been told to avoid taking the train.
udes fans heading to Twickenham on Saturday afternoon to see England take on South Africa.
While it is a 24-hour strike, it's expected that there could be some knock-on disruption into Sunday.
Aslef industrial action follows four previous 24-hour strikes by drivers, which led to train services being cancelled and delayed.
re has been widespread disruption on the railways this year, with the RMT union also taking action at Network Rail and 14 train companies. Previous strikes by the RMT have had a major impact on services throughout England, Scotland and Wales.
Union bosses have said that with prices of food and energy soaring, companies should be paying their members more.
Meanwhile, railway bosses have said they want to give workers pay rises but insist changes are needed to ""modernise"" working practices and save money.
Aslef's Mr Whelan told the BBC: ""We don't want other workers suffering, we don't want the general public suffering going forward.
""But the only way we've got at this moment in time to reinforce our needs and other people's needs is to take the action we're taking.""
UK has been hit by a wave of strikes this year, with unions across a range of industries, representing different job roles, staging walk-outs.
utes are over working conditions, pensions and pay. Prices are rising at over 11% per year, the fastest rate for 40 years. That means workers are seeing their living costs rising faster than their wages, leaving them worse off.
Cameron Hughes, 21, from Surrey works in a supermarket warehouse, and says the trains not running means he can't see his girlfriend Natasha, who lives in Bournemouth.
He is particularly reliant on trains for travel this weekend as he is not allowed to drive, since his doctor suspects he may have epilepsy.
""If my epilepsy diagnosis is confirmed, then I'll forever be reliant on trains for travel. I really hope the negotiations between train staff and operators work out as it affects my future.""
However, he does understand why workers are striking.
""Other countries like Japan have great train systems and have not seen a strike in a long time. I think the operating companies could improve conditions for train workers here,"" he says."	/news/business-63755411

Ms Roberts also stressed the ""importance of having the flu vaccination"".
More than 400 people are in hospital with flu across Birmingham and Solihull.
Prof Dhruv Parekh from University Hospitals Birmingham said they were seeing a ""worrying number of patients being admitted"" into critical care units with respiratory failure as a result of flu infection.
""We haven't seen these numbers of serious flu infections since before the Covid-19 pandemic,"" he added.
Several hospital trusts across England have announced critical incidents in the past 24 hours, including in Greater Manchester and Surrey and Sussex.

politics	Watchdog apologises after MPs' Christmas expenses row	"Parliament's expenses watchdog has apologised for publishing advice that MPs could claim for the cost of an office Christmas party.
Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) faced a backlash from MPs after saying they could claim for festive get-togethers.
MPs on all sides rejected the guidance, with one calling it ""bonkers"" amid a cost of living crisis. 
Ipsa's chief executive Ian Todd said the body had ""got the messaging wrong"".
In a letter posted online, he added that some MPs had had to deal with ""phone calls, e-mails and in some cases abuse as a result of our guidance"".
Ipsa had initially defended its approach, saying after it was published that holding a ""modest gathering"" for MPs' staff was ""entirely appropriate"".
In his letter, Mr Todd said Ipsa had produced the guidance following requests for advice about applying the organisation's rulebook. 
He added that afterwards he was contacted by numerous MPs, who ""have made it clear to me that they have never made such claims in the past and have no intention of doing so in the future. I accept and respect that.""
""We got the messaging wrong by allowing the impression to form that this is what MPs were wanting to do, rather than our interpretation of the discretion available under the existing rules,"" he added.
""We are an independent body and we make our own decisions but occasionally, like everyone, we make mistakes.""
""In issuing it we also failed to recognise the public mood at a time of severe economic and financial pressures. I am sorry for that.""
In an update from Ipsa last week, MPs were told they could claim for ""festive office events"" for staff - as long as they were parliamentary in nature, not party political and represented value for money.
MPs were told they could claim for food, decorations and drinks - but not alcohol. 
was roundly criticised by MPs across the political spectrum.
Labour MPs were told it would ""clearly be inappropriate"" for them to claim at a time of rising living costs. Liberal Democrat Chief Whip Wendy Chamberlain also said none of her party's MPs would be claiming, calling the advice ""tone deaf"" amid the cost living crisis.
Conservative Former Brexit secretary David Davis called the rules ""bonkers"" and said Ipsa had ""missed the mood of the age"".
A spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he wouldn't be claiming for a party, and that MPs would have to ""justify all spending to their constituents""."	/news/uk-politics-63750920
sports	GAA Social: Austin Gleeson opens up on weight issues following 2017 All-Ireland final	"Waterford hurler Austin Gleeson has opened up on how his weight issues spiralled after reaching the 2017 All-Ireland final.
Deise star, 27, joined Thomas Niblock and Oisin McConville on the latest episode of The GAA Social.
Gleeson shot to hurling stardom in 2016, just his third year at senior level, when he was named Hurler of the Year aged just 21.
xt year Waterford reached the final but lost to Galway.
""After the All-Ireland I just decided to go on the tear with the lads for two weeks, got knocked out early in club, kept going on the tear,"" Gleeson revealed.
""Eventually my weight just went crazy. It was something that I severely struggled with, getting it back down.
""No matter what I tried for some reason I just couldn't get it down.
""Without me even realising my weight just went up and kept going and going, and I could not get back to where I was in 2016.""
It was in the early weeks of the spring 2020 Covid-19 lockdown that Gleeson, who noticed that being largely housebound had once again increased the speed with which he was gaining weight, sought the help of an online personal trainer.
Having been permitted to bring home some of the gym equipment from his club Mount Sion, the 2016 All-Star saw an opportunity to ensure he was in the shape of his life for hurling's return.
Four gym sessions and up to three cardio sessions a week, coupled with 10,000 steps a day, brought about swift progress.
""It's weird the way it fell. The last week of the PT, I finished with him on a Friday and eight days later we played our first club game,"" Gleeson reflected.
""It was eight weeks I did with him, and on the week I finished with him I was playing club again. It was like someone told me almost 'this is when to start because this is when it's going to kick off again', but none of us knew when it was going to kick off at that time.
""It's always something that has stuck in my head, that someone's told me somewhere that that's the case.
""It was tough, those eight weeks were very tough but it was definitely something I needed to do.""
In September Gleeson was sent off less than two minutes in to Mount Sion's Waterford Senior Hurling Championship semi-final with Roanmore, having been dismissed earlier in the year in Waterford's league semi-final against Wexford.
Despite sometimes paying the price, Gleeson insists playing on the edge is an essential component of his game.
""Across the white line I'm a completely different person than I would be off the field. Anyone who knows me would say the same,"" he said.
""Playing down in Waterford in club games, I could be playing against my best friends but I don't care. I want to win. When we're losing I can lose the head a small bit.
""There were people that tried to change the way I was playing in previous years and trying to put me in positions where I couldn't do much. I just couldn't get into games and found myself getting more frustrated. I need to play off the cuff, that's my game. """	/sport/gaelic-games/63550490
sports	Football kit sales delayed as supply chain issues hit clubs	"Fewer than half of English Football and Premier League clubs have both their new home and away kits available to buy online ahead of the season, as manufacturers face supply chain issues. 
Only 44 out of 92 clubs currently have both their 2022-23 season kits on sale. 
Premier League clubs including Crystal Palace and Leeds United are among those who have neither kit available.
Some have blamed the delays on disruption and factory shutdowns in Asia due to Covid. 
It means some clubs won't have their new kit on sale before the season starts, which for the Championship is 29 July, for League One and League Two is 30 July and for the Premier League is 5 August. 
Out of the 92 clubs in the top four leagues: 
One English Football League chief executive, who did not want to be named, told the BBC his club had signed off kit designs in October, with orders placed shortly afterwards, but neither their new home or away kit were available to sell yet due to Covid disruption at factories in Asia. 
He said it was difficult to quantify the cost to the club until it saw the impact on sales, but added that some clubs would face a financial hit. 
""We can manage our cash flow, but it will impact on some clubs' cash flow, I'm sure, because July is a month when there's not much cash coming into the business,"" he said. 
""We're in a position where that hasn't caused any disasters for us. But for some clubs I would imagine it's pretty difficult.""
He added that the delay would also be disappointing for fans. 
""If you're a parent or a grandparent who's going to buy a kit for a young child's birthday in July, which you would normally have done, you've not been able to do that, you've got to wait,"" he said. 
Sandy Domingos-Shipley has three children, aged 15, 13 and eight, who are all Leeds United supporters. 
Normally she would buy them the new kit as soon as it was released before the start of the season but this year she hasn't been able to, with the club saying it won't be on sale until late August. 
Although Sandy said she would still be buying the kit when it was available, she added: ""The season will be four weeks in and for the kids it kind of ruined the moment because it became our own tradition.
""It makes no sense because that's when you know that you're gonna get lots of people to buy.""
Manufacturer Adidas said: ""Like many other industries, we continue to be confronted with limited port and transport capacities. 
""We understand the frustration felt by the fans at this time and we have worked in close collaboration with our club partners to find the best solution on delivering the product as soon we can.""
Leeds United did not respond to a request for comment. 
Kieran Maguire, a senior lecturer in football finance at the University of Liverpool, said some clubs were being affected by the impact of Covid in Asia, where many factories are based, with production limited due to restrictions. 
He said a shortage of container ships and disruption at ports was also contributing to the issue. 
However, he told the BBC the financial impact on most elite clubs would be limited as they are generally paid a fixed amount by manufacturers for the season, with only around 7% commission per unit sold. 
""I think fans are fairly sanguine in relation to this,"" he said, adding that fans who wanted the kit would still buy it when it was available. 
Mr Maguire added that the other peak market for clubs was Christmas and the issue should be resolved by then. 
He said smaller clubs were more likely to be affected, as manufacturers would prioritise bigger clubs who sell more shirts. 
Others have faced different issues. 
On Friday, Stockport County said it had been ""significantly let down"" by its kit provider Puma. 
""It has recently come to light that their shipping partner has mislaid part of the shipment due to be delivered, and as a result we are unable to fulfil a number of orders placed by fans whilst they try to locate it,"" the club said in a statement. 
If the shipment could not be located, the club said it would have to wait until the next delivery was due, which was 30 November for home kits and 30 September for away kits. 
It apologised to fans affected and said they could get a full refund or a 20% discount if they chose to wait for the delivery.

business	Shell agrees to sell Russian retail business to Lukoil	"Energy giant Shell has agreed to sell more than 400 of its petrol stations in Russia to the country's second largest oil producer, Lukoil. 
Shell Neft, the firm's subsidiary in Russia, will be sold for an undisclosed sum.  
Many Western oil and gas firms have been looking to offload their Russian businesses following the country's invasion of Ukraine. 
Shell said the deal, which includes 411 petrol stations, will protect 350 jobs. 
udes a lubricants blending plant around 200km north-west of Moscow. Lukoil is Russia's largest oil producer after state-backed Rosneft. 
Shell announced in February that it would sell its Russian assets because of the invasion of Ukraine.
Earlier this month, it reported record quarterly profits as energy firms continue to benefit from surging oil and gas prices.
In the first three months of this year, Shell made $9.13bn (£7.3bn) - nearly triple its $3.2bn profit it announced for the same period last year.
But the firm said pulling out of Russian deals, which include the sale of its stakes in all joint business ventures with Russian state energy firm Gazprom, had cost it $3.9bn (£3.1bn).
""Under this deal, more than 350 people currently employed by Shell Neft will transfer to the new owner of this business,"" said Huibert Vigeveno, Shell's downstream director. 
Maxim Donde, Lukoil's vice president for refined products sales, said: ""The acquisition of Shell's high-quality businesses in Russia fits well into Lukoil's strategy to develop its priority sales channels, including retail, as well as the lubricants business.""
When the conflict in Ukraine broke out, energy firms came under immediate pressure as countries announced bans and curbs on Russian oil and gas in the weeks following the invasion. 
BP owns a large stake in Russian energy giant Rosneft, but within days of the war starting it had announced the operation would be hived off.
It was closely followed by pledges from Shell, ExxonMobil and Equinor to cut their Russian investments following pressure from shareholders, as well as from governments and the public.
Energies, another big player in Russia, has said it will not fund new projects in the country, but unlike its peers does not plan to sell existing investments.
Russia is the world's third biggest producer, after the US and Saudi Arabia.
Despite widespread sanctions and many countries reducing their reliance on Russian oil, the country has almost doubled its monthly earnings from selling fossil fuels to the EU, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.
EU has imported about €22bn (£19bn) of fossil fuels per month from Russia since the start of the war as oil and gas prices have soared, compared with an average of about €12bn (£10.2bn) a month in 2021.
Multinational firms that announced reductions in their business activities in Russia have begun reporting associated losses. 
Lukoil deal is one of the earliest in which a Western firm, UK-listed Shell, has been able to sell off its Russian assets. The sale is still subject to regulatory approval by Russia's anti-monopoly service. "	/news/business-61424715

business	Consumer confidence hits record low as prices soar	"UK consumer confidence in the future hit a record low in August due to the soaring cost-of-living and bleak economic prospects.
A ""sense of exasperation"" about the economy was the biggest driver behind the fall, according to GfK's Consumer Confidence index.
Recent data showed that prices rose at the fastest pace 40 years in July and the UK is heading for recession. 
Meanwhile, retail sales volumes fell by 1.2% in the three months to July.
Office for National Statistics (ONS) said people were continuing to cut back on non-essential spending, in particular clothing and household goods. 
Rachel Barber, legal partner and retail specialist at accountancy firm Deloitte said that because people are pessimistic about the state of the economy, many people ""are now postponing major purchases such as electricals and furniture"". 
Fuel sales also declined in July as people cut down on travel, deterred by petrol and diesel prices as well as the recent hot weather. 
Sales volumes nudged up slightly in July, by 0.3%, after a small fall in June, but overall figures show sales have been on a downward trend since summer 2021. 
However, overall retail sales were still above pre-Covid levels, the ONS said.
GfK consumer confidence barometer, which surveys the public about their opinion of the economy, was at its the lowest level this month since records began in 1974.  
""These findings point to a sense of capitulation, of financial events moving far beyond the control of ordinary people"", said Joe Staton, GfK's client strategy director.
""With headline after headline revealing record inflation eroding household buying power, the strain on the personal finances of many in the UK is alarming,"" he added. 
Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said that the summer sunshine was responsible for the slight uplift in sales in July: ""But most retailers will still be seeing falling volumes in the face of rising inflation."" 
Inflation - which measures the rate of price rises - hit 10.1% in July and is expected to soar to more than 13% later this year when the latest energy price cap on household bills comes into force in October. 
Bank of England now expects the UK economy to fall into recession later this year and forecasts the downturn will last for 15 months. 
Clothing stores sales volumes declined by 1.2% in July and household goods stores sales volumes were down by 0.4%, mainly because of falls in furniture and lighting stores.
ONS said that feedback from retailers suggested that consumers were cutting back on spending because of ""increased prices and affordability concerns"".
Deloitte's Rachel Barber said: ""Consumer confidence in the state of the economy has plummeted so you're finding that one in five people are now postponing major purchases such as electricals and furniture and you can see that in the statistics today, that they're down about 1.5%. 
""You're also seeing one in three consumers buying their main food shop at a discounter which is up from 28% a year ago, so there are definite changes happening in the consumer's mind in everything they are spending,"" Ms Barber told the BBC.
One retailer which has been on the receiving end of the downturn in sales, is Joules the clothing and homeware retailer with a rural vibe. 
rand, which has its roots in country and equestrian shows, issued a profits warning on Friday. 
In a statement it said trading in the five weeks to 14 August had ""softened materially"" because of the extremely warm and dry weather, which hit sales of outerwear, rainwear, knitwear and wellies. 
""compounded the ongoing subdued consumer demand due to the well-documented cost-of living crisis"".
At the same time it confirmed ""positive discussions"" were continuing with rival retailer Next about the latter taking a stake worth about £15m in it. 
However, Joules said there could be ""no certainty that these discussions will lead to any agreement"".  
-of-living crisis is being driven by higher fuel, energy and food prices. These increases are putting a squeeze on people's finances, as wages fail to keep up.

business	National Insurance rise to be reversed in November	"A 1.25% rise in National Insurance will be reversed from 6 November and the government will axe a planned levy to fund health and social care.
rise was introduced in April under ex-Chancellor Rishi Sunak, but during the Tory leadership race Liz Truss pledged to change it.
funding for health and social care will now come from general taxation.
Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng made the announcement ahead of a ""mini-budget"" on Friday.
reasury said the change would save nearly 28 million people an average of £330 per year.
Most employees will get the tax cut in their November pay packets, with some getting it in December or January ""depending on the complexity of their employer's payroll software"", the Treasury said.
About 920,000 firms will get a tax reduction of nearly £10,000, it added.
National Insurance is a tax paid by employees, employers and the self-employed.
Employees pay National Insurance on their wages as well as income tax, employers pay extra NI contributions for staff, and the self-employed pay National Insurance on their profits.
""Taxing our way to prosperity has never worked,"" Mr Kwarteng said. 
""To raise living standards for all, we need to be unapologetic about growing our economy. Cutting tax is crucial to this.""
National Insurance rise was put in place to help the NHS recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and the planned social care levy was also designed to support the NHS from April.
was expected to raise around £13bn a year to fund social care and deal with an NHS backlog that built up during Covid.
You only needed to tune in to the Conservative leadership contest for a minute to know that the rise in National Insurance would be reversed if Liz Truss became prime minister.
Now we know the result of that promise will be seen in pay packets from November.
But there are so many other factors in play at the moment. This has been a topsy-turvy time for our finances. 
Changes to policy, prices, bills and the economy as a whole have made it tough to budget, even for the near future.
Experts would encourage everyone to prepare the best they can. Prioritising essential bills, building a savings buffer, perhaps putting even a small amount aside for Christmas are all sensible ambitions, they say, even if the rising cost of living - and events you cannot control - make those habits so much more difficult to maintain.
re are weekly thresholds for National Insurance. There is nothing to pay on the first £242 earned per week, then it is 13.25% on earnings between £242.01 and £967 and 3.25% on the rest.
means, in general,people who earn more than £12,570 a year pay National Insurance, and the more they earn, the more they will benefit from this change.
For example, somebody earning £20,000 will save about £93 a year, and somebody earning £100,000 will save £1,093, compared to now.
From April 2023 Mr Kwarteng will also scrap an increase to dividend tax. This change was brought in alongside the payroll tax increase to raise taxes on people paid in a different way.
Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors industry body, said raising employers' National Insurance had been ""a mistake"".
""This was quite simply a tax on jobs, which businesses had to pay regardless of whether they are profitable,"" she said.
""Many of our members told us that the impact of the increase was that they would have no choice but to push up prices, making inflation even worse.
""Others said the rise in the cost of employing people meant they would think twice about taking new staff on, or potentially make the difficult decision to let colleagues go.""
government announcement came ahead of a ""mini-Budget"" which is expected to be announced on Friday.

health	Wales NHS: Prioritise patients waiting longest - minister	"NHS in Wales needs to ""speed up the process"" of treating people waiting over two years for hospital treatment, the health minister said.
Eluned Morgan said health boards need to prioritise the ""longest waiters and they're not always doing that"".
re are 59,350 people waiting over two years in Wales, although the number has fallen for a fifth month in a row.
Welsh NHS Confederation, which represents NHS health organisations, has been asked to comment.
In Wales, there are 183,450 operations and procedures waiting more than a year.
Overall waits - from referral to treatment - have passed 750,000.
Scotland has 7,650 patients waiting more than two years, England has 2,646.
Asked on BBC Politics Wales why so many more people are waiting longer in Wales, Ms Morgan said: ""Our health boards need to make sure that they're taking people from the longest waiters and they're not always doing that.""
Stewart Rathbone from Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, has been waiting for more than two years for a hip replacement.
58 year-old used to work on a dairy farm, which provided a house for his family to live in.
Unable to work because of his deteriorating hip, Mr Rathbone lost his job and had to move home.
""Financially, it destroyed me. As a family, it totally destroyed us,"" he said.
""If I'd had the operation at the outset... what happened to my family wouldn't have happened.
""I'd be probably still working on the same farm.""
In the Senedd last week, Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies raised incidents of people who had to wait hours for an ambulance, prompting an angry response from First Minister Mark Drakeford.
f Keith Morris, 79, who was left in pain on the floor for 15 hours while waiting for an ambulance, was one of those raised.
His daughter, life-long Labour voter, Andrea Morris Nicholas, told Politics Wales she was ""disappointed"" with Mr Drakeford's reaction, adding ""he has to take responsibility"".
Asked if the first minister and Welsh government accepted responsibility, Ms Morgan told Politics Wales: ""We're responsible for running the NHS. 
""I think what's important for people to understand is that we're limited by budgets.
""So, that means we don't have the money to spend on the NHS that we'd like to have at a time when demand is going through the roof.
""We've already recruited an additional 250 ambulance workers, we've got another 100 coming on line.
""They'll be ready by December... so, a bit later than we'd hoped, but had we not started that recruitment campaign back in April, we wouldn't be ready.""
Mr RT Davies told the programme the first minister's reaction in the Senedd - when Mr Drakeford accused the Conservatives of making a mess of the UK's finances and reputation - ""was beyond reprehensible"".
""I had the temerity as the leader of the opposition to turn up, point out two particular cases of individuals...who had to wait excessive times for ambulances to arrive,"" said Mr RT Davies.
""Now, that's my job, but for the first minister to try and deflect like he did on to the UK government really shows that the Welsh Labour government have run out of answers.
""Yes, the cash does come from Westminster, but it's up to the devolved governments to decide how they carve that up. 
""In the early parts, 2010 to 2015, the Welsh Labour government, the only government in the United Kingdom, voted to cut their NHS budget whereas all other governments - whether it be a nationalist government in Scotland, a Conservative government in Westminster or an executive in Northern Ireland - protected the health budget. 
""So, in there are the seeds of the problem that we are facing today,"" he added."	/news/uk-wales-63357412
business	Energy bills to rise more than predicted, says Ofgem boss	"Domestic energy bills will rise faster this winter than previously forecast by the energy regulator Ofgem, its chief executive has admitted to MPs.
Jonathan Brearley said in late May that a typical household would pay £800 a year more from October. 
But, while giving evidence to MPs, he said it was ""clear"" that estimate for winter bills now looked too low.
riginal figure was used by ministers when deciding how much to pay in direct assistance this winter.
One industry analyst has predicted a rise of more than £1,200 a year in October. Cornwall Insight said that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay £3,244 a year from October, then £3,363 a year from January. 
resent is about £2,000 a year. In itself, this was a rise of £700 a year in April, compared with the previous six months.
About 23 million households in England, Wales and Scotland have their bills governed by the energy price cap. That limits the amount suppliers can charge per unit of energy, and the standing charge, and is set every six months. From this winter, it is expected that this will change to a three-month period.
Mr Brearley said in May that a typical household gas and electricity bill on the price cap would increase to £2,800 a year, owing to continued volatility in gas prices.
But on Monday, he told MPs on the Public Accounts Committee that it was ""clear"", given the current ""pricing dynamics"" and the ongoing war in Ukraine, that ""prices are looking higher than they did when we made that estimate"".
However, he would not be drawn on exactly how much higher bills would be, ahead of the official announcement in the coming weeks.
Starting later this week, direct payments will be made to low-income households to help with the cost of living and covering energy bills.
Sarah Munby, permanent secretary at the Department for Business, said ministers would ""keep a close eye"" on whether this policy should go further if bills rose higher than expected.
Ofgem also told MPs that it had found issues with direct debit demands from suppliers, during a review following accusations that companies increased customers' direct debit payments by ""more than is necessary"".
More details will be announced in the coming days.
Soaring wholesale prices meant around 30 suppliers have collapsed during the crisis that has hit the sector. A total of 26 remain in the market.
About 2.4 million customers were automatically moved to a rival company when their own supplier folded. Typically, according to Citizens Advice, they had to pay an extra £30 a month for the duration of their original contract, as they were shifted to a more expensive tariff.
In addition, the cost of these failures totalled £2.7bn - a tab which was spread across all billpayers in Britain at a cost of about £94 each, not just those of the failed companies. This is before taking into account the potentially multi-billion charge that households could face due to the collapse of Bulb Energy, which is in special administration.
Last month, it was announced that Hayden Wood, who was the company's boss and co-founder, would leave at the end of July.
In June, the National Audit Office (NAO) said Ofgem had allowed an energy market to develop that was vulnerable to large shocks.
NAO said that Ofgem had decided on a ""low bar"" approach for allowing new domestic energy suppliers into the market to encourage competition and choice for customers after the market had been dominated by six big companies.

""I went for some doubles and trebles, some of them went in, crazy things can happen when you go for it.""

entertainment	Queen of Country music Loretta Lynn dies aged 90	"Loretta Lynn, whose songs of strength and independence made her a standard-bearer for women in country music, has died at the age of 90.
Known as the Queen of Country, her songs were rooted in real-life experience, most notably on the autobiographical Coal Miner's Daughter.
Other hits included Don't Come Home A-Drinkin', Honky Tonk Girl and the feminist anthem, The Pill.
Lynn's family said she died on Tuesday at her home in Tennessee.
""Our precious mom, Loretta Lynn, passed away peacefully this morning, October 4th, in her sleep at home in her beloved ranch in Hurricane Mills,"" the family said in a statement. 
ked for privacy as they grieve and said a memorial would be announced later.  
ger was born Loretta Webb in a one-room log cabin in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky in 1932. She was the second of eight children.
Just as she would later sing in Coal Miner's Daughter, her family eked out a living during the Depression, with her father earning a ""poor man's dollar"" by working all night in the coal mines, and all day in the fields ""a-hoein' corn"".
family made its own entertainment - her mother played guitar, with her father accompanying on banjo - and she grew up on the songs of the Carter Family.
""I was singing when I was born, I think,"" she told the Associated Press in 2016. ""Daddy used to come out on the porch where I would be singing and rocking the babies to sleep. 
""He'd say, 'Loretta, shut that big mouth. People all over this holler can hear you.' And I said, 'Daddy, what difference does it make? They are all my cousins.'""
At the age of 15, she attended a ""pie social"" - where local girls would bake a pie, and men would bid to win both the food and a meeting with the cook. 
Loretta's pie, accidentally baked with salt instead of sugar, was won by Oliver Lynn, a 21-year-old solider, who swept her off her feet. A month later, they married and moved to Custer, Washington, where they raised four children.
Her husband, whom she called ""Doo"" or ""Doolittle,"" urged her to sing professionally and bought her a $17 (£15) Sears guitar, with which she started a band, Loretta and the Trailblazers, that also featured her brother Jay Lee Webb.
By 1960, she had signed a contract with Zero Records and released her debut single, I'm a Honky Tonk Girl. 
g was inspired by a woman Lynn befriended in Washington, whose husband had left her for another woman. Lynn said she wrote the song while leaning up against an old toilet in her house, the words pouring out of her in a 10-minute burst of inspiration.
She and her husband promoted the song relentlessly, driving to radio stations around the country to pester DJs into playing it, and sending out hundreds of free discs.
ffort paid off. I'm A Honky Tonk Girl reached number 14 on the country charts, and Lynn relocated to Nashville, where she was quickly snapped up by Decca Records. 
She released her first Decca record, Success, in 1962, beginning an impressive stretch of hits that continued into the 1990s.
Lynn earned her first number one with Don't Come Home a Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind) in 1966, and topped the US country charts another 15 times. 
She recorded 60 albums in total, and was nominated for 18 Grammy Awards, winning three.
Her songs frequently depicted broken relationships and unhappy homes - but were unusual for expressing a female point of view at a time when that was unheard of in country music. 
Many addressed Doolittle's infidelity and alcoholism. You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man) and Fist City were feisty warnings to any woman who considered approaching her husband, while 1971's I Wanna Be Free fantasised about divorce. 
""I'm gonna take this chain from around my finger / And throw it just as far as I can sling,"" sang Lynn.
""I've wrote every song I ever wrote about him,"" she told a BBC Arena documentary. ""He gave me a lot of opportunities.""
Lynn later confessed that the relationship could turn violent - although she gave as good as she got.
""If he smacked me or anything, I'd stand up and be fightin' him just like I'd be fightin' the other woman,"" she told PBS's American Masters documentary in 2016. ""He'd smack me, I'd smack him; he'd pull my hair, I pulled his hair. That's the way it was."" 
Despite their troubles, the couple stayed together for 48 years until Oliver's death in 1996.
Lynn's songs weren't just about relationships, however. Dear Sam was inspired by the women left at home during the Vietnam War, with lyrics that ran: ""Don't misunderstand/ I know he's fighting for our land / I really love my country/ But I also love my man"", while The Pill was a frank and funny celebration of reproductive choice. 
""This old maternity dress I've got is going in the garbage/The clothes I'm wearing from now on won't take up so much yardage,"" sang the star. ""Miniskirts, hot pants and a few little fancy frills/Yeah, I'm making up for all those years since I've got the pill.""
Although she wasn't initially credited as a writer, it later transpired she had played a part in its composition. Speaking to NPR in 2010, the mother of six said the lyrics spoke directly to her own experiences.
""If I'd had [the pill] I would have used it,"" she said. ""'Cause back when I was having all the kids, we didn't have birth-control pills. Or if we did, I didn't know anything about them.""
ubject matter meant her record label held the single back for several years. When it was finally released in 1975, many country radio stations refused to play it, keeping it from hitting number one. But it still reached the top five, and became Lynn's biggest crossover pop hit.
By that time, Lynn had begun a professional partnership with country star Conway Twitty, with whom she scored hits like After the Fire Is Gone, Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man and As Soon As I Hang Up The Phone. The musicians were named vocal duo of the year by the Country Music Association for four consecutive years from 1972 to 1975.
Lynn published her autobiography, also called Coal Miner's Daughter, in 1976, and it was turned into a film in 1980, earning Sissy Spacek an Oscar for best actress.
musician's output slowed in the 1980s and she announced her retirement in the 1990s - although she still managed to release a handful of albums, including 1993's Honky Tonk Women, a collaboration with fellow country music trailblazers Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. 
In the meantime, she turned her attention to food, launching a restaurant called Loretta Lynn's Kitchen, and a series of cookbooks that mixed recipes with stories from her life.
She also opened the Loretta Lynn Ranch in Tennessee - Lynn's equivalent to Parton's Dollywood - which hosts a museum and campsite, and stages regular music events. 
In 2004, her career was resurrected by super-fan Jack White, who encouraged her back into the studio for an album that combined his abrasive rock sound with Lynn's penchant for pedal steel and banjo.
um showed that her narrative power was undiminished (one song, Ms Leroy Brown, told of a bored housewife who stole her husband's savings to rent a limousine and go on a bender) and gained her a new audience at the age of 72, as well as the Grammy Award for best country album.
In 2013, Lynn was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honour in the United States, by President Barack Obama.
Later albums included Full Circle, a mix of new songs and remakes of old standards, and 2021's Still Woman Enough, which saw her duet with Margo Price and Tanya Tucker.
Lynn stopped touring in 2017 after a stroke, and suffered a broken hip after falling over at home the following year. But she continued to perform and record, and forcefully denied tabloid reports at the time that her health was failing.
""Through the years they've said I'm broke, homeless, cheating, drinking, gone crazy, terminally ill, and even dead! Poor things can't ever get it right,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""I guess if those old pesky tabloids are harassing me then they're giving someone else a break... but I'm about an inch from taking 'em to Fist City!""
It was that down-to-earth gutsiness that endeared her to fans over the last six decades, and one that ensures her music still feels relevant.
""I like real life, because that's what we're doing today,"" she said 2004. ""And I think that's why people bought my records, because they're living in this world and so am I. So I see what's going on, and I grab it.""
Lynn is survived by four of her six children: Clara, Ernest and twins Peggy and Patsy, as well as 17 grandchildren and four step-grandchildren."	/news/entertainment-arts-63134852
politics	Three PMs in two months, is political chaos the UK's new normal?	"Rishi Sunak is the UK's third prime minister in less than two months - the fifth in six years. It is the fastest turnover of leaders in No 10 for nearly a century.
Since the summer of 2007, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Mr Sunak have all held the top office. In contrast, there were just three prime ministers in the 28 years before - Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair.
What is the cause of the revolving door at No 10? And could this trend be the new normal for British politics? 
Jill Rutter, from the think tank the Institute for Government, believes the Brexit vote in 2016 has been the number one destabilising factor in British politics over the last six years.
""We can attribute almost all of the instability to a fallout of the Brexit referendum and what it has done to the Conservative Party,"" she says.
""David Cameron was a long-serving prime minister. Had he not had the referendum, he could have been on track till 2018 and would have handed over to either George Osborne or Boris Johnson.
""He was derailed by calling the referendum. It was a tactical error not to go all-out for the victory and thinking victory was in the bag,"" she adds.
Mr Cameron's resignation after six years in office paved the way for Theresa May. She spent three years and 11 days in office, while her successor, Boris Johnson, spent three years and 44 days at the helm.
""Theresa May was clearly brought trouble by a twin combination - the disastrous election in 2017 and the fact that she and the party could not agree what Brexit meant,"" Ms Rutter adds.
She says the Conservative Party ""thought Boris Johnson could break the Brexit deadlock, but one of the ways he did that was by not paying much attention to norms and rules"".
""It was his failure to do this that brought him down. It meant his ministers could not take it anymore. They'd gone for somebody in desperation.""
Liz Truss's shorter premiership at barely seven weeks was, according to Ms Rutter, a direct legacy of the referendum. 
""The membership had changed quite a bit,"" she explains. ""They were ready for the message about ignoring orthodoxy. But they discovered when they went hell for leather against conventional wisdom, they fell over in a heap.""
Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at King's College in London, agrees. 
""The referendum has destabilised British politics,"" he says. ""The difficulty has been to find the right relationship with Europe.""
But is it really all about Brexit?
m Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University, believes the trend could be something that runs much deeper.
He points to what he calls the ""presidentialisation"" of the UK's parliamentary system, or the greater focus on party leaders, as one of the reasons that prime ministers' terms are not lasting as long.
""There is far more focus from voters and politicians on party leaders and rather less on the party as a whole - that means that the leader is often held personally responsible for anything that goes wrong,"" he says.
""It is now pretty much impossible for a party leader to lead his or her party [after] an election defeat,"" he explains, adding that former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was the notable exception to the rule in 2017.
Aged 42, Rishi Sunak is the youngest prime minister in more than 200 years. He has risen through the ranks of the Conservative Party in the space of just seven years since he was first elected as an MP in 2015. 
""MPs can come into parliament and very quickly gain a name for themselves,"" Prof Bale says.
""That has destabilised parliamentary politics. It used to be quite hierarchical, but MPs are generally impatient to move up the ladder but also if they think things are not working they would be piling onto Twitter and the rolling news channels to say 'something needs to change - and that includes the leader'.""
Prof Bale believes the rise of social and digital media has also made a big difference to how voters view politicians. 
In the past, ""politicians were not faceless,"" he says, ""but they were not the celebrities they are now. That feeds through to how voters view politics.""
Prof Bogdanor disagrees. The governments of David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill during the two world wars, William Gladstone in the 19th century, and more recently Margaret Thatcher could all be described as ""presidential,"" he argues.
""Governments have always been presidential,"" he says. ""The power of the prime minister ebbs and flows really with their electoral position."" 
Prof Bogdanor believes Mr Sunak might now usher in a period greater stability.
""I cannot see him being overthrown in the next two years. There is going to be economic hardship, but the Conservatives have two years until the next general election.""
But Patrick Dunleavy, emeritus professor of political science and public policy at the London School of Economics, believes an election will be held before the two-year deadline.
""I do not think that the two years is a credible timeline now,"" he says, arguing that pinch points for Mr Sunak include the local council elections next year and then his anniversary in office, depending on his opinion poll ratings.
Prof Dunleavy also sees the problem in other Westminster-style systems. Australia, which is also a parliamentary system, has had nine prime ministers in 12 years, owing in part to what are called spill elections. It has led to Australia being dubbed ""coup capital of the democratic world""..
Leadership spills occur when members of the parliamentary party feel that the leader is taking them in the wrong direction, or not delivering on the promises made to those who elected them, and does not have the numbers to back their position.
""The Conservative Party has moved over to full spill election operations. They were threatening Cameron in 2016, they were used against May - she survived the first one then she had to give up - they were used against Boris and then against Truss,"" Prof Dunleavy says.
""Spill elections are definitely here in the UK.""

politics	Rishi Sunak thanks public servants with surprise Christmas calls	"Rishi Sunak has surprised public servants working across the world over Christmas with a personal phone call to thank them for their efforts. 
Instead of a traditional message to the nation, the PM called diplomats, Royal Navy crew and a childcare provider in Pakistan, Somalia, Ukraine and the UK. 
Mr Sunak said he was grateful for their ""sacrifice"" over the festive period.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer used his message to pay tribute to the Ukrainian people and those working at Christmas.
In the UK, Mr Sunak spoke to Chris Mitchell, who runs Smart Play, a government-funded holiday activities and food programme in Barnet, north London. 
rime minister also called Svita Yavorska, who works for the UK's embassy in Ukraine. She told Mr Sunak how she had fled to Poland, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February, helping to set up a temporary base there, before returning to the city of Lviv in western Ukraine. 
Speaking to diplomat Nic Guffog, who is based in Mogadishu, Mr Sunak heard how staff at the UK's diplomatic compound were living in containers under the threat of terror attacks, as they supported the Somalian government to counter the militant Al-Shabaab group and deal with the hunger crisis facing the country. 
He also spoke to some of the crew of HMS Protector, which is currently deployed off the coast of the South Sandwich islands in Antarctica. 
It comes as the UK is facing a wave of industrial action, including by NHS and Border Force staff, with members of the armed forces stepping in to cover striking workers.
Although Mr Sunak did not follow the tradition of recording a Christmas message that is broadcast to the UK, he did issue a statement.
Mr Sunak said: ""Whether you are working in Mogadishu or Milton Keynes this Christmas, I want you to know that I am personally grateful for your sacrifice. 
""This year has been an extraordinary year for so many reasons, but most of all, it's been a year in which the true spirit and resilience of the United Kingdom has been on show, from the support given to our Ukrainian friends, to the work being done to ensure essential aid reaches the most vulnerable overseas.
""And closer to home, those who have checked on friends and neighbours, volunteers, public servants and essential service staff all working over Christmas - I am truly humbled by your dedication and I know your selflessness this festive season will spread cheer across the country."" 
Mr Sunak also tweeted a short video to the people of Ukraine, writing: ""This Christmas, we're with you...""
And in a Christmas message on Twitter, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the prime minister and British public, saying he was ""grateful"" for their support and ""warmth of your hearts"".
In his annual Christmas message, Labour's leader acknowledged that for many people in Britain ""life is tough at the moment"". 
""But Christmas is a reminder that we will endure, that things will get better,"" Sir Keir Starmer added. 
""I hope this Christmas is a joyous and relaxing time for you, however you are spending it. I'm looking forward to sharing my time with my family, away from the day to day of work,"" he said. 
""But as I do I will be keeping in my heart all those who are working to keep us safe. Those looking after the less fortunate, and our friends in Ukraine, facing the horror of Putin's appalling attacks. Their struggle for freedom inspires us all.""
SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon used her festive message to offer a ""heartfelt thanks"" to public sector workers and noted ""tough times"" for Scotland.
She said: ""Especially after the past two Christmases, I know most of us will be really looking forward to this festive period.
""Of course, the cost-of-living crisis is making this a very hard winter for many. So this Christmas, it's important for all of us to also think about how we can help others.""
In his message, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""For me, the message of Christmas is for us to treat others as we would wish to be treated and the symbol of Christmas is light - the light of hope, in the darkest week of the year. 
""Hope that we all desperately need for these most challenging of times."""	/news/uk-politics-64079793
technology	The super material reinforcing rinks, cars and buildings	"It looked like normal concrete. It poured like normal concrete. But it had a super power.
James Baker, chief executive of Graphene@Manchester, couldn't quite believe what he was seeing as he observed the installation of a new roller disco floor in Manchester's Depot Mayfield development. 
rete slab was setting so fast, and so strong, that the builders had begun gliding polishing machines over the driest part of the floor while their colleagues were still pouring the other end of the rink. 
""Normally, you'd have to wait a week before you could do that,"" he says. The installation, in October last year, took less than a day. 
rete was special because it contained a tiny but transformative amount of graphene, microscopic flakes of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice.
Graphene is the strongest material ever discovered but for nearly two decades has struggled to find a revolutionary role in commercial products. Is that about to change?
Besides improving the mechanical properties of certain materials, it is hoped graphene could also make some projects more environmentally-friendly. 
""By adding as little as 0.1% graphene into cement and aggregate, you can potentially use less material to get the same performance,"" explains Mr Baker. Reducing the amount of concrete used in construction for instance by 30%, could lower global CO2 emissions by 2-3%, he estimates.
Besides the roller disco, Mr Baker and his colleagues have also trialled the graphene-infused concrete, known as concretene, in a gym floor in Wiltshire and some road projects, including a section of the A1 several hundred metres long in Northumberland. 
m will also pour concretene in an as-yet undisclosed project in the United Arab Emirates this year.
rly trials have comprised fairly straightforward projects, Mr Baker explains - floor slabs, rather than walls or elevated platforms, which might be more risky. So far, the concretene has performed as expected, though.
But why does graphene have this effect on concrete? Carbon fibres have previously been used to reinforce concrete and graphene (though flakes of it are much smaller in size than carbon fibres) plays a similar role, says Lisa Scullion at the University of Manchester's Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre.
re is more than that going on, however. The fragments of graphene may also change how the concrete sets around it.
""It almost provides nucleation sites on the surface of the graphene, to regulate that structure within the concrete,"" says Dr Scullion, adding that scientists are still working out the consequences of this. It could make the concrete denser, or change the structure of pores within the concrete.
Perhaps something closer to a block of cheddar, as oppose to Swiss cheese, I suggest.
It's enough to remove the requirement for reinforcing steel bars within the concrete in some applications, says Dr Scullion.
Beyond concrete, graphene could improve the durability of paints and coatings as well, warding off rust. ""Because you've got all these little tiny flakes, water and corrosive ions can't penetrate through to the metal as quickly,"" says Dr Scullion.
And by improving the strength of construction materials, architects could one day design much more elaborate and irregular facades, perhaps some inspired by shapes in nature, suggests Pasquale Cavaliere at the University of Salento.
Graphene has been the subject of excitement for years, ever since its discovery at the University of Manchester in 2004. The hype surrounding it has itself become the subject of studies and there are some who remain sceptical that it will live up to these lofty expectations.
uzz around graphene has led to a ""wild west"" situation in which some products containing the material may be highly priced yet actually low in quality, said Krister Svensson, associate professor of physics at Karlstad University in an interview published in 2019.
He tells BBC News that the quality of graphene in use today varies greatly. Plus, he questions whether the use of graphene as a reinforcing agent is really necessary, since graphite and carbon fibres can perform a similar role.
""Graphene is still relatively young,"" admits Mr Baker. But he and his colleagues are determined to ""accelerate the adoption of graphene"", he adds. 
More technology of business:
Companies that have experimented with the material have sometimes found that it has slightly different uses to what they initially intended.
""We love graphene,"" says Debbie Mielewski, technical fellow for sustainability at Ford. She says that since 2018, the car maker has shipped between six and seven million vehicles, mostly in North America, containing graphene in a handful of parts.
At first, she and her team were interested in graphene because of its strength-enhancing capabilities. But they found that it was actually more useful in terms of reducing noise and vibration, or improving heat resistance.
Cars including the F-150 and Explorer SUVs, now contain 12 small components in and around the engine such as pump covers or water tube supports that feature graphene, partly because it absorbs noise.
Depending on the frequency of sound in question, these components can reduce noise heard inside the vehicle by between 12% and 25%, says Dr Mielewski.
It's also made those parts lighter, lowering the total mass of the car by roughly one and a half pounds (680g). This means these vehicles use slightly less fuel and therefore have lower CO2 emissions over their lifetime.
Ford is working with US firms, XG Sciences and Eagle Industries, on various graphene applications.
Dr Mielewski says the carmaker is exploring the possibility of adding graphene to plastics inside the vehicle in order to make them stronger but explains that, so far, they have not been able to disperse graphene within the plastic as well as hoped.
ften a key stumbling block when adding graphene to a particular material. In order to actually enhance its properties, the graphene must be dispersed uniformly. But depending on how the material is formed or mixed, and the temperatures and pressures involved in that process, it can be tricky to achieve the desired result. 
It's a bit more complicated than this but imagine trying to get an even spread of raisins in a fruit cake when the batter is too runny.
Obtaining a delightfully even mix, and a material that is unequivocally improved by the addition of graphene, is what all these researchers and companies are aiming at. 
Because with graphene, the proof is most definitely in the pudding."	/news/business-61913871
politics	Senedd member Hefin David reprimanded over 'vulgar tweet'	"A Labour Senedd member has been reprimanded for a tweet, prompting a reminder to politicians to behave on social media.
Hefin David was found by a watchdog to have breached the code of conduct when he tweeted a ""vulgar and grossly offensive personal attack"".
Caerphilly Labour MS was officially censored in a unanimous decision of the Senedd on Wednesday.
Mr David had apologised and deleted the post early the next day it was sent.
A party colleague told the Senedd politicians should treat social media in the same way they would approach meeting people.
John Griffiths, acting as temporary chairman of the Welsh Parliament's standards of conduct committee, said Senedd members should treat ""interactions on social media in accordance with the same principles that would be applied to face to face interaction"".
Welsh Parliament follows findings by the Standards Commissioner, Douglas Bain, and the standards committee.
ure is an official reprimand but is not as serious as other punishments available, such as a temporary ban from the parliament.
In his report Mr Bain said Senedd members ""are rightly required to show leadership and to be exemplars of good behaviour"".
He said ""abusive use of social media reflects badly on him but also tends to bring the Senedd into disrepute"" and concluded that Mr David's conduct ""fell very far below the required standards"".
Mr Bain said the MS has told him he has taken steps to prevent ""any further misuse of social media"" and that he had urged him to ""take care in his use of that medium"".
mmittee decided not to include the contents of the tweet in its report ""as we consider it may cause further distress to the subject and their family to do so, particularly as they were not the complainant""."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63730331
politics	Cost of living: Schools with healthy reserves face budget pressure	"Higher electricity bills and finding the cash for staff pay is still a worry for a school with a million-pound buffer, its head teacher has said.
Ysgol Friars, in Bangor, Gwynedd, carried over £974,000 from last year as figures show the pandemic left school reserves up across Wales.
One union called the figures a ""smoke screen"" because most reserves are ring-fenced for specific projects.
Welsh government said it recognised the pressure on public services.
A recent survey of head teachers has suggested pressures on school budgets could mean staff cuts across Wales.
f Ysgol Friars, Neil Foden, said the 1,400-pupil secondary school had seen its electricity bill double. 
""That's going to cost us probably between £45,000 and £50,000 in this financial year with a significant increase on that in the following financial year,"" Mr Foden said.
f just about everything - from maintenance work to photocopier paper - has gone up, he said. 
But he said his biggest concern was where the money would come from to pay a 5% increase in teachers' salaries and other staff pay. 
Salaries take up about 80 to 85% of the overall school budget.
ucation minister told BBC Wales the additional reserves schools had accrued over the Covid pandemic could help some meet the pay settlement for teachers.
He added this was not the case for all schools and he recognised it was variable across the system.
A spokesperson for the NASUWT teaching union said it was ""simply not good enough"" for the Welsh government to claim its hands were tied, and to attempt to shift the responsibility for funding the investment in teaching on to the UK government. 
It added there could be a ""very real"" prospect of industrial action in the new year. 
rector of Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, Eithne Hughes, described the 5% rise as ""derisory"" and said it could lead to redundancy of teachers and larger class sizes for pupils. 
A union has warned of potential redundancies, something Mr Foden has ruled out for his school. 
But he said he anticipated difficult decisions for some schools long-term.
""I wouldn't be at all surprised if, at the end of the 2023-2024 academic year, there will be schools shedding staff, both teaching and non-teaching,"" he said.
Ysgol Friars is one of almost 1,000 schools in Wales that had reserves in excess of 10% of their expenditure at the end of March 2022.
Overall, schools had reserves of £301m, the equivalent of £659 per pupil, up from £32m in 2019-20.
Mr Foden said rolling over almost a million pounds into this financial year was ""absolutely unheard of for us"".
""In normal circumstances a balance that size, you wouldn't even dream of having it,"" he said. 
Partly a quirk of the pandemic, schools spent less on bills during closures and got a refund when exams were cancelled.
On top of that, extra grant money from the Welsh government given late in the financial year also boosted budgets.
""But it's already gone down,"" Mr Foden said, explaining how refurbishing the school library and employing counsellors to address increased demand for mental health support since the pandemic had put a big dent in cash.
r believes reserves could help as a short term ""financial cushion"" for schools facing higher costs.
But 44 of the 1,479 schools in Wales started the financial year in the red.
Association of School and College Leaders said reserves were mainly made up of money for specific projects, not for ongoing costs such as covering salaries.
Eithne Hughes, the union's director in Wales, said it was ""a poor state of affairs"" if funds earmarked for Covid recovery were used to ""prop up the whole education system"".
She called it ""a smoke-screen to hide the fact we have got a real and significant problem for funding in our schools"".
""Some of the things they will be doing is they'll be looking to cut staffing, and as soon as they cut staffing those class sizes are going to be larger,"" she said.
""I'm hearing of some schools where those class sizes will be up to 38 at secondary school level. 
""Now that is just untenable.""
A recent survey by head teachers' union NAHT Cymru suggested many of its members were looking at staffing cuts.
Hywel Parry, head of Ysgol John Bright secondary school in Llandudno, Conwy county, said financial planning is difficult when there was so much uncertainty about energy bills and other costs. 
""We're now looking at potentially catastrophic budget cuts,"" he said.
""At what stage are we unable to continue to provide a safe education for learners under the types of cuts that are being proposed.
""It just adds to that impending sense of doom.""
Hugo Hutchison, head teacher at 1,700-pupil Monmouth Comprehensive School, said school leaders were concerned about the warnings they were hearing about cuts.
""We've put a huge amount of investment into well-being support - the recovery out of the pandemic and looking after students' mental health and wellbeing, as well as that of staff,"" he said. 
""That provision wouldn't be able to be afforded by any school if we had the level of cuts that are being discussed at the moment.""
Welsh government said it recognised the financial pressures inflation and energy costs placed on public services, and called for more funding from the UK government.
A spokesman added ""overall school budget reserves remain very high"", and that it would support local authorities and schools in deploying them."	/news/uk-wales-63611991
politics	Conservative MP for Kingswood to step down at next election	"Kingswood MP Chris Skidmore became the latest Conservative MP to announce he will not be standing in the next election.  
Mr Skidmore, 41, said ""there has been no greater honour in my life"" than representing the constituency in Parliament for the past 12 years. 
When boundaries change, the Kingswood constituency will cease to exist. 
MP said in a statement at the weekend he did not wish to stand elsewhere. 
Mr Skidmore was born and grew up in Kingswood, which sits on the eastern edge of Bristol.
""I do not wish to fight another constituency elsewhere in the region or the country, especially with a very young family who deserve to see more of their father in their lives,"" he said.
""I would like to thank local constituents for putting their trust and faith in me to serve as their local MP.""
Mr Skidmore signed the UK's net zero by 2050 commitment into law in 2019 while serving as Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation in Theresa May's government. 
For the past three months he has been leading a review of the government's delivery of its net zero targets. 
MP said that outside of Parliament, he hoped to continue to focus on tackling global warming.
""It is clear to me that net zero and tackling climate change will be the greatest challenge, yet also the greatest opportunity, of our generation,"" he said.
""It is this opportunity - to demonstrate how we must protect our environment and climate for the future, at the same time as delivering a new clean and sustainable energy system that shifts us away from fossil fuels - that I now wish to devote my attention to."" 
He added: ""Rather than step aside, I hope that in the future I can step up to continue to play my own small part in helping to deliver on the energy transition that the world needs.""
Mr Skidmore's announcement follows that of Dehenna Davison, the Conservative MP for Bishop Auckland.
29-year-old was elected as the County Durham constituency's first Tory MP in 2019.
Elsewhere, senior Conservative MP William Wragg, vice-chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers, has said he will not run again.   
Conservatives Chloe Smith, MP for Norwich North, and Gary Streeter, MP for South West Devon, also announced last week they intended to stand down.

health	NHS Wales: Hospital staff 'in tears' over A&E pressures	"Keith Royles lived over the road from  the Ysbyty Glan Clwyd hospital
Patients being treated in chairs, staff in tears and an 18-hour wait for transfer from an ambulance.
re some of the extreme pressures experienced by the Royal Glamorgan Hospital's emergency department.
Dr Amanda Farrow was called in early to a recent shift at the site serving much of the south Wales valleys because the nurse in charge felt it was ""unsafe"".
On arrival, the number of patients awaiting beds was far higher than trollies available.
Meanwhile, six ambulances were queuing outside, unable to hand over their patients and, as a result, also unable to respond to other emergency calls.
Dr Farrow, the lead consultant at the A&E department of the hospital near Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said: ""She has never rung me before so I know when I get that phone call that I just need to get up and come in.
""We have 16 trolleys and we had 28 patients waiting for beds in the morning. Our resuscitation room was full and we had some very, very sick patients that all arrived at a similar time.
""Patients who are not on trollies are obviously sat in chairs, which is not a good experience. We also have a finite number of chairs in the clinical space.
""A number of members of staff were in tears.""
knock-on effect was soon felt outside the hospital's front door, with ambulances stacking up outside.
As a result the ambulance service was struggling to respond to urgent 999 calls in the community.  
""In extreme cases the department can receive an immediate release request, calling on them to admit a patient and release the ambulance as soon as possible to attend an extremely urgent call,"" said Dr Farrow.
""Yesterday during my shift we had two calls for an immediate release, because there was an unwell baby and there was a lady in labour."" 
""[With] the first one we did manage to bring the patient in, with a view to getting one of our patients out, But the [call] later in the day we were unable to accommodate.""
She continued: ""It is a lot of responsibility for the staff - none of us wants to be making these decisions. We're all doing our best and there is concern around the impact this is having on staff because that does cause moral injury.
""It's not just patients arriving in the ambulance. The majority of our patients actually self-present to the hospital. 
""We are having to pull them out of the boot of cars, they're coming by fire engine, with the police. We have to try and find somewhere to manage that and it's just a constant challenge.""
In September, Keith Royles, 85, broke his hip and was forced to wait seven hours for an ambulance, and then had to wait outside the hospital until the early hours of the morning.
His daughter Tina Royles told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast that her parents were ""horrified"".
""My parents put their whole lives into nursing and they're quite disgusted, they understand the pressures on the NHS staff, but the system is broken.
She said as a former police officer she knows how busy A&E gets, but it was never like it is now. 
Despite the long wait, Ms Royles said the staff who looked after her dad were amazing. 
Lee Brooks, executive director of operations at the Welsh Ambulance Service, said he was deeply sorry about Mr Royles' experience, describing the seven-hour wait as unacceptable. 
""It will take a system-wide effort to resolve a system-wide issue and we continue to play our part to alleviate the pressure by treating more patients over the phone and at home and referring them to more appropriate areas of the NHS, negating the need for a trip to the emergency department.""
Dr Farrow stressed that being ""supportive to all of our staff"" is extremely important to the department.  
""We're a very close-knit team and we do try, at the end of the shift, [to] go around and chat to the staff just to make sure that everyone's OK,"" she said.
During the shift, the department was escalated to its highest level of alert  - level 4/20 - meaning staff from across departments worked together to try to free up beds on the wards to ease the pressure in A&E.
resulted in a decision to open dozens of beds as part of ""surge capacity"", including opening an unused ward. This in itself was difficult due to staff shortages.
re is also a dedicated team who try to identify patients, who, given the right care and support might be able to leave without being admitted.
Gladly by the next morning the situation had stabilised.
""We had good supportive response from the rest of the sites... so this morning it's really quite pleasant which is a change but yesterday was extremely challenging.""
But Dr Farrow said she worried about what lies ahead this winter as a result of staff shortages, the potential re-emergence of respiratory viruses like flu and the added demand of chronically ill patients who may have stayed away during Covid coming back into the system.
""It is quite scary to be honest. 
""I think every winter in recent years has been challenging and I think we're fearful this is going to be even worse."""	/news/uk-wales-63889127
entertainment	PnB Rock: Father and son pair charged with rapper's murder	"A father and son have been charged with the murder of rapper PnB Rock. 
musician, 30, was shot dead at a Los Angeles waffle house on 12 September.
Authorities say Freddie Lee Trone, 40, and his 17-year-old son were each charged with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree robbery and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery.
Mr Trone's wife Shauntel has also been arrested and charged with one count of being an accessory after the fact.
PnB, real name Rakim Hasheem Allen, rose to fame with the release of his 2016 hit Selfish and had collaborated with artists including Ed Sheeran.
He was having lunch with his girlfriend on the day of the shooting when a gunman approached the pair at Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles in south LA.
Police said the suspect demanded they hand over valuables shortly before he opened fire, removed items from the victim then fled in a waiting getaway car.
PnB suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead in hospital 45 minutes later.
ger, who name was not published in the charge announcement, made his initial appearance in a juvenile court and is scheduled to return on 19 October for a pre-trial hearing.
Los Angeles's top prosecutor, District Attorney George Gascón said PnB's killing had ""dimmed a bright light in the lives of his fans, friends and most importantly his family. 
""The accused individuals' alleged actions in this case were heartless and cruel and robbed the world of Mr Allen's talents.""
ributes flooded in for PnB after his death, from artists including Drake, who posted a photo of the two together on his Instagram story.
Rapper Offset posted a Twitter tribute urging followers to pray for PnB's two children, with Nicki Minaj calling him ""a pleasure to work with"".
PnB Rock was born in Philadelphia in 1991, going on to record two studio albums, Catch These Vibes and Trapstar Turnt PopStar.
He released his final song, Luv Me Again, just two days before the shooting.

politics	Energy advice: Sunak to expand tips campaign to lower bills	"Rishi Sunak's government is drawing up plans to expand a public information campaign aimed at helping households reduce their energy use this winter.
A website has already been launched with tips such as switching off radiators and turning down boilers.
A government source told the BBC plans to step up the campaign were in the ""design phase"".
f the publicity blitz has yet to be revealed but ministers say they want to keep it to a minimum.
A Times report suggested the campaign could cost £25m and would involve broadcast adverts, social media messaging and online advice.
wspaper suggested celebrities would be recruited to deliver money-saving advice, but government sources have said this was ""unlikely"".
governments of Germany, France and other European countries have been promoting similar campaigns to save energy, but the UK has been slow on the up-take.
Former Prime Minister Liz Truss was reported to have been ""ideologically opposed"" to such a campaign, fearing it would be too interventionist, or ""nanny state"".
But her government rowed back on that position last month and said it was considering how to expand the existing Help for Households website.
Ms Truss's successor as PM, Mr Sunak, and his ministers appear to be more comfortable with steering people towards advice on how to reduce their energy consumption.
Speaking to the BBC on Thursday, Housing Secretary Michael Gove said: ""What we will be doing and should be doing is pointing people towards authoritative sources of advice on how to minimise energy usage.""
government says the Help for Households website includes simple actions people can take to save further money on their energy bills if they wish to.
ude:
A government spokesperson said while everyone has different energy needs, ""we recognise that people may be interested to learn more about how they can further cut their bills"".
""Our existing public information campaign, Help for Households, is driving up the public's awareness of all the support available to help them with the cost of living, including saving money on energy bills. We continue to look at ways to further promote energy savings,"" the spokesperson said.
government has capped the amount per unit of energy suppliers can charge consumers so that a typical bill remains at £2,500 a year until the end of March.
But help with energy costs will be less generous from April, with bills for a typical household going up to £3,000.
Office for Budget Responsibility says total support for energy costs is expected to cost the government £43.2bn this year.
ut costs at a time of economic downturn, Mr Sunak's government has introduced a drive to reduce household energy consumption.
In his Autumn Statement this month, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt announced plans shave £450 off the average household bill by increasing the energy efficiency of homes and businesses.
He said a further £6bn would be made available to fund improvements in energy efficiency from 2025.
Homes in the UK among the worst insulated in Europe, leaving the country exposed to the high heating bills expected this winter.
On Wednesday, Mr Hunt described cutting energy use as a ""national mission"" to stop the UK being ""blackmailed"" by the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
war in Ukraine has tightened supplies of gas, which the UK is heavily reliant on for heating and powering its homes and businesses.
Mr Hunt told MPs ""in the end everyone is going to have to take responsibility for their energy bills"" and consider how to cut their consumption."	/news/uk-63754094
technology	Twitter UK staff get deadline over cuts consultation	"witter staff in the UK who face losing their jobs have been given three days to nominate someone to represent them in a formal consultation about their employment.
Under UK employment law a consultation has to be carried out before redundancies can be made.
An email seen by the BBC from Twitter's European HR department says they have until 0900 Tuesday to decide who to put forward, and was sent on Friday night.
Staff can nominate themselves.
If there are more than 10 nominations, an election will be held, the email said, although there were no details offered as to how this would be organised.
It comes after Elon Musk, the company's new owner, said he had ""no choice"" but to cut 50% of Twitter's staff worldwide.
Mr Musk said the firm he bought for $44bn at the end of October is currently losing around $4m per day.
first Twitter layoffs were announced one day after Mr Musk bought the company.
CEO Parag Agrawal was among the workers who received their notice, with around half of Twitter's 7,500 staff expected to be cut. 
Following the announcement, the workers union Prospect said it now has ""dozens"" of Twitter UK staff members on its books.
If more than 100 people in the UK are affected by a firm's job cuts then there must be a 45-day consultation before any redundancies can be made, it added.
A senior official told the BBC three days was a very short time frame for people to organise themselves or communicate with each other, especially given that most still have frozen access to company-wide work platforms such as the messaging service Slack and their Twitter email accounts.
Seven days was considered a ""reasonable"" period of time for this to take place, she said, although there is no official rule. 
Mr Musk first announced he wanted to buy Twitter for $44bn in April - but it took a long and tumultuous six months for a deal to be struck. 
In July, the tech billionaire said he had pulled out of the sale because he had not been given enough information on how many real, active Twitter users there were.
witter responded by taking Mr Musk to court so that he would honour the sale.
urt case was then stalled when Mr Musk announced that he had bought the platform for $44bn at the end of October.
re is uncertainty over Mr Musk's plans for the platform's future. Online safety groups and campaigners have expressed concerns about his plans to relax content moderation and reverse permanent Twitter bans given to controversial figures, including former US president Donald Trump.
He also sparked criticism for suggesting that verified Twitter users pay $8 (£7) a month for their blue ticks."	/news/technology-63527336
health	Critical incident declared across all Nottinghamshire hospitals	"High demand for hospital services has led to a ""critical incident"" being declared across all of Nottinghamshire.
In a statement the NHS in the county said ""extended waiting times"" for beds and ""difficulties in discharging patients"" had added to problems with lots of people turning up to hospitals.
It comes a day after Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust cancelled operations and declared a critical incident due to A&E pressures. 
Industrial action is also taking place.
Anyone with an appointment should attend unless they have been contacted to say it has been cancelled, a statement said, but anyone needing non-emergency treatment is being advised to call 111 or contact their GP or pharmacy.
""Our aim is to prioritise patients with the highest level of need and ensure that we continue to be able to manage emergency care,"" it said. 
""This means that some operations and outpatient appointments may be postponed to prioritise patients with the most urgent clinical need.""

entertainment	How Gangsta's Paradise changed the course of hip-hop	"When Coolio first heard the demo that became Gangsta's Paradise, he had the same reaction as the rest of us.
""I was like, 'Damn, I really like this song.'""
Pennsylvania-born, Compton-raised rapper was at his manager's house in 1995 to pick up a cheque, when he noticed producer Doug Rasheed messing around with the song in another room.
""So I went to Doug said, 'Yo! What's this?'"" 
""He said, 'It's just a song we're working on', 
""And immediately I said, 'It's mine'. Just like that. 
""I freestyled the whole first line, then I sat down, I picked up a pen and I started to write."" 
Released in August 1995, and boosted by a memorable video starring Michelle Pfeiffer, the song immediately ruled the airwaves. 
urching stings, the other-worldly choir, and that soaring hook, combined with Coolio's distinctive, confessional storytelling, made it an instant classic.
It was the first ""serious"" rap song to top the UK and US charts, opening the door for acts like 2Pac and the Notorious B.I.G, who, until that point, had been considered too abrasive for the mainstream. 
And its appeal has never lessened. The biggest-selling single of 1995 in America, Gangsta's Paradise has now been streamed more than one billion times on both Spotify and YouTube. 
""I thought it was going to be a hood record,"" he told The Voice in 2017. ""I never thought it would crossover the way that it did - to all ages, races, genres, countries and generations.""
And yet... Gangsta's Paradise faced several hurdles on its way to the top. Here's how it unfolded...
Coolio was born Artis Leon Ivey, Jr in Pennsylvania, and moved to Compton in South Central LA as a boy. Suffering from chronic asthma, he became a bookworm and excelled at school.
""I lived in that library, man,"" he told Rolling Stone, while visiting his old neighbourhood in 1995. ""I read every kid's book they had in there. I even read Judy Blume.""
ged when he turned 11 and his parents divorced. Seeking a way to fit in, he fell into the gangster lifestyle and adopted a menacing, street-tough persona. A few years later, he was busted for bringing a weapon into school. Before he turned 20, he had served time behind bars for larceny.
Later, Coolio studied at Compton Community College and discovered rap. He took his stage name, Coolio Iglesias, from Latin heartthrob from Julio Iglesias, and released a few singles on the local scene, but drug abuse derailed his career.
In his 20s he moved to San Jose to live with his father, while working as a firefighter; and later credited Christianity for helping him overcome his addiction to crack.
Still enamoured with rap, he made a guest appearance on WC and the Maad Circle's 1991 debut album, Ain't a Damn Thang Changed; then joined a collective called the 40 Thevz before signing a solo deal with Tommy Boy records - the influential label that played home to De La Soul, Naughty By Nature and House Of Pain.
His first album, It Takes a Thief, arrived in 1994, and was praised for its combination of funky grooves and socially-conscious lyrics. The musician's message was exemplified by the ""hilarious"" video for Fantastic Voyage, said Source magazine.
""As the Lakeside groove carries you along, Coolio piles about six milion people into the trunk of his '64 and takes them to a magical land where race, poverty, gangs and sexual orientation don't matter and everybody was cool.""
Hip-hop's gatekeepers were not interested in such idealism. Ivey's anti-violence, pro-acceptance stance somehow made him ""soft"". He earned the unwelcome nickname ""Un-Coolio"".
But then came Gangsta's Paradise.
One day, Doug Rasheed pulled out his copy of Stevie Wonder's 1976 double-album Songs In The Key Of Life and cut a sample from Pastime Paradise, a bleak and anxious track that was one of the first songs to replace an orchestra with synthesized strings.
Rasheed added a crunching beat and a menacing synth bass, then took the track to singer Larry ""LV"" Sanders, who laid down a vocal for the chorus.
""I came in singing 'Pastime Paradise,' but then I changed it up to 'Gangsta's Paradise,'"" he told Rolling Stone for an oral history of the song in 2015. 
""I did my parts, all the vocals and the chorus, and I did the choir. That whole choir that you hear was actually me - I did all the parts from soprano down to tenor to the bass.""
LV wanted a rapper to appear on the track, and offered it to his friend Prodeje, who declined. Then Coolio overheard it.
Mesmerised, he started writing lyrics straight away. The opening lyric, which riffs on Psalm 23, came to him instantly: ""As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death/I take a look at my life and realise there's not much left.""
""I freestyled the whole first line, then I sat down, I picked up a pen and I started to write,"" he told the YouTube series Hot Ones in 2016.
""It was divine intervention. I was an instrument and the song was the entity. It wrote itself.""
Coolio was 30 at the time the song was written, but the narrator is 23 and he doesn't know if he'll live to see 24. He was ""raised by the street"", immersed a life of crime and retribution. If anyone crosses him, they'll end up ""lined in chalk"". 
But the story never glorifies the gangster lifestyle. The narrator prays every night, aware that he's trapped. In the final verse, he accuses the system of letting him down.
""They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me / If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?""
It's a bleak story. One that could only have been told with the perspective Coolio gained from his teenage years. And the rapper bristled when his song was lumped in with the so-called ""gangster rap"" scene.
""I'm trying to get rid of that jacket that's been put on my back - that I'm a gangsta rapper,"" he said in 1995. ""That's not my thing.
""My thing is to be true to myself and try to educate and entertain kids. When I make references [to the gangster lifestyle], I'm trying to get kids' attention using language they want to hear.
""Then I can take them to a deeper level. I'm just trying to get a better understanding of myself and a better understanding of other people.""
Gangsta's Paradise was a stark departure from the feel-good funk of Coolio's first album and, at first, his record label weren't sure what to make of it. 
""I called my A&R at Tommy Boy Records, and I played it for him. He said, 'It sounds pretty good - I think it would make a good album cut.' Those were his exact words!""
Incensed, the star's manager decided to shop the song around to movie studios. It nearly ended up on the soundtrack to the Will Smith film Bad Boys, but was eventually placed in the Disney movie Dangerous Minds - the true story of a former Marine who turns around a troubled inner-city high school by teaching them poetry and Bob Dylan lyrics.
A lukewarm retread of Dead Poets Society, it was allegedly testing badly with audiences until Coolio's song started getting played on MTV. The video, like the film, starred Michelle Pfeiffer, who went face-to-face with Coolio as a camera spun around them.
""She was real nice,"" Coolio told Kiss FM's Rap show at the time. ""She brought her son down to the shoot with her and she was cool. We had no problems.""
He was less enamoured with the movie itself, though.
""I hate those kinds of movies where, you know, the great white hope comes into the inner-city neighbourhood and saves the little children - 'Ooh la la, hey Santa Claus!' or whatever, all those kinds of things put it in play,"" he told Yahoo two years ago. ""Those kinds of moments happen very few and far between. It's not that many people that care about each other [in real life].""
According to Rolling Stone's oral history, the producers of Dangerous Minds, Coolio was paid $100,000 (£92,000) for Gangsta's Paradise. There was only one problem: Stevie Wonder hadn't cleared the sample.
""When Stevie heard it, he was like, ""No, no way. I'm not letting my song be used in some gangster song,'"" the star recalled. 
Luckily, Coolio's then-wife Josefa Salinas, knew Wonder's brother. ""I guess he had been trying to tap that for years,"" he joked in the Rolling Stone article. 
""She made a call to him, got a meeting with Stevie and talked him into it. His only stipulation was that I had to take the curse words out.""
undoubtedly changed Coolio's life. A profane version of Gangsta's Paradise would never have been played on pop radio, or entered heavy rotation on MTV. 
When it hit number one, it opened up new possibilities for hip-hop... although, to some, it marked the end of an era.
""America suddenly realised it could sell non-party rap to Brit panty-waists, and that's exactly what it's done ever since,"" wrote music journalist Garry Mulholland in his book This Is Uncool: The 500 Greatest Singles Since Punk And Disco.
""In many ways, Gangsta's Paradise signalled the end of gangsta, or 'reality' rap as a cult. It lost the allure of the forbidden when you mum started singing along.""
Coolio was ambivalent about the song too, often lamenting how its success overshadowed his other work.
""It's a blessing and a curse at the same time,"" he said. ""For people that really like Gangsta's Paradise, that's all they really want to hear.""
In recent years, however, the musician came to appreciate the song's legacy, and his role in hip-hop history.
""People would kill to take my place,"" he said in 2018. 
""I'm sure after I'm long gone from this planet, and from this dimension, people will come back and study my body of work.""

sports	Nottingham Panthers: Corey Neilson on search for 'Panther way' in Challenge Cup	"Corey Neilson owns the Challenge Cup. Where it is, he is not entirely sure.
Canadian lifted the domestic trophy on six occasions in his first stint as Nottingham Panthers boss. 
After Panthers won a record five in a row they were given the silverware to keep, and an entirely new cup was minted as a replacement.
k Brazil's national football team winning the World Cup for the third time in 1970 and being given the original Jules Rimet Trophy - just on ice.
Before his first Challenge Cup tie since returning to the Panthers, the 46-year-old smiles when asked where the 'Corey Cup' is.
""They gave me the 'Corey Cup' when they changed trophy - they said 'keep this, we have made a new one',"" he recalls.
""I don't know where it is, but I'm going to say in the club office somewhere.""
up that so defined Neilson's first glorious spell in charge of the club - one that yielded 12 major trophies to make him the most successful coach in Panthers history - could again come to shape his second stint.
Over two legs of their quarter-final against Belfast Giants, when aggregate goals come into play, Neilson hopes to see the struggling Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) side rediscover some of their lustre.
""Aggregate goals has honestly always favoured the Panthers because we could score,"" he said going into Thursday's home leg.
""Defence wins you play-offs and championships, but with aggregate goals you can lose 2-1 but then beat them 6-1 and aggregate scores come into play.
""We could reel teams in because we always had that one element we did really well - we could score. Yes, sometimes we were a bit sketchy defensively but we could score.
""Right now I want my players to be going a thousand miles an hour and we will find solutions to win.""
ree head coaches held the top job at the Panthers in the four years between Neilson's two reigns.
None managed to deliver a major trophy, with Neilson being the last do so when he guided them to Continental Cup success in Europe in 2017.
When he returned to the National Ice Centre in October, Panthers were four points from the foot of the EIHL table. They had scraped through to the knockout stages of the Challenge Cup as the bottom-ranked side in the competition.
Neilson freely admits it ""would take an awful lot to get to the top"" of the EIHL, having overseen just two wins in six league games since returning - a run of results which leaves Panthers still just five points off the bottom.
Since landing back in the East Midlands after four years away coaching in Germany, Norway and Slovakia, Neilson has tried to rebuild the Panthers piece by piece in a three-week period he has approached as a ""training camp"".
""If you don't have a plan, I don't know how people expect to get to where you want to go,"" Neilson mused before their latest EIHL weekend, which included a 7-1 defeat by Manchester Storm before returning home to beat Cardiff Devils 5-2.
""So it's about forward planning - first learning to play without the puck, then learning to play with the puck, then trying to figure out how to do both. Hopefully it is locked in for the cup game.
""Everything is by design.""
final design he is building towards is the ""Panther way"" - re-establishing the club as one of the city's major sporting attractions, an entertainment brand that enjoyed a golden period of success.
""If we lose 5-4 right now, it's not the end of the world,"" Neilson said. ""We are miles away from winning the league championship, but we can get ourselves in a position to do some damage when it comes to the cup competition.
""It is not a sports car, we can't just stop and go this way. No, it's a big boat that is going to take a lot of turning and lot of rudders to get it going the other way. It takes time.
""I'm being a realist, of course want to win that [EIHL title], but the priority has to be to bring back the energy, the joy of the players coming in to practice hard, and having fun practicing hard, playing hard and competing and showing fans they really care and want to win - showing we are trying our absolute best every time we get on the ice. 
""That, I guess, is the Panther way."""	/sport/ice-hockey/63948101
technology	Google sign-up 'fast track to surveillance', consumer groups say	"Google is facing action from a coalition of ten European consumer organisations over the company's account sign-up process. 
A Google account is essential in order to use a number of its products and services.
But the coalition alleges the sign-up process steers users towards options that collect more data.
Google told the BBC it welcomed the opportunity to engage with consumer advocates on the topic.
mpany said that consumer trust depended on honesty and transparency and it had ""staked our future success on building ever simpler, more accessible controls and giving people clearer choices. 
""And, just as important, doing more with less data"". 
European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), which co-ordinates the coalition, claims the language Google uses in the registration process is ""unclear, incomplete, and misleading"" leading many consumers to pick options that are less privacy-friendly.
As a result ""tens of millions of Europeans have been placed on a fast track to surveillance when they signed up to a Google account"" BEUC claims.
umer organisation believes sign-up is the critical point at which Google asks users to choose how their account will operate. 
But the simplest one step ""express personalisation"" process, it alleges, leaves consumers with account settings that ""feed Google's surveillance activities"". 
And the consumer organisation says Google does not provide users with the option to turn all settings 'off' in one click.
Instead, BEUC says, it takes five steps and ten clicks to turn off the trackers Google wants to activate on a new account - these relate to web and app activity, YouTube history and personalised advertising on their account.
Ursula Pachl, deputy director general of the BEUC, said: ""It takes one simple step to let Google monitor and exploit everything you do. If you want to benefit from privacy-friendly settings, you must navigate through a longer process and a mix of unclear and misleading options.
Ms Pachl added: ""In short, when you create a Google account, you are subjected to surveillance by design and by default. Instead, privacy protection should be the default and easiest choice for consumers.""
EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires platforms to give users privacy by design and by default.
But Google maintains that all options are clearly labelled and designed to be clear and simple to understand.  
re based the company says on extensive research, guidance from regulators and testing.
It told the BBC ""People should be able to understand how data is generated from their use of internet services. If they don't like it, they should be able to do something about it.""
BEUC members in the Czech Republic, Norway, Greece, France and Slovenia have filed GDPR complaints against Google with their respective data protection authorities, and groups in Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands have written to their own authorities about the concerns. 
Federation of German Consumer Organisations has sent a warning letter to Google.
As this latest action launches, the BBC has been told that a previous investigation prompted by BEUC has made progress.
In 2018 Members of the BEUC filed a similar complaint against Google alleging the tech giant breached General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements through user location tracking. 
Ireland's Data Protection Commission was appointed the lead authority on the complaints in July 2019. 
mmission is lead data protection authority for Google and numerous other tech companies with European headquarters in Ireland.
It launched an inquiry into Google's use and collection of location data in February 2020. 
But Ms Pachl said, ""it is more than three years since we filed complaints against Google's location-tracking practices and the Irish Data Protection Commissioner in charge has still not issued a decision on the case. Meanwhile Google's practices have not changed in essence.""
However Graham Doyle Ireland's Deputy Data Protection Commissioner told the BBC that ""our investigation into Google and location data is well progressed and we expect to send a draft decision to our colleague Data Protection Authorities in the next couple of months for their views""."	/news/technology-61980233
business	Liz Truss set to cut energy bills for millions	"Prime Minister Liz Truss is understood to be planning to borrow billions to limit the expected sharp rise in energy bills for households and firms. 
It is understood that a typical energy bill could be capped at around £2,500 with full details expected on Thursday.
Currently, a typical household's gas and electricity bill is due to rise from £1,971 to £3,549 in October.
government's plans to subsidise bills means that customers will not be expected to repay the support.
It is unclear how long the government support will last, but the overall government support package is expected to total around £100bn.
ultimate figure will depend on gas and energy price movements in the highly volatile international energy markets as well as how much additional support is offered to the most vulnerable. 
Ms Truss has pledged to ""deliver on the energy crisis"" - with details expected to be announced on Thursday.
Energy bosses have insisted for some time that a government-backed superfund from which they could borrow to subsidise bills ""is the only game in town"".
However, the government is understood to be reluctant to see money added to customer bills for up to 20 years so energy companies could pay back the loans.
It is also thought to be reluctant to add the cost to general taxation, given their pledges to be a tax cutting government. 
Kwasi Kwarteng - tipped to be the new chancellor - has already indicated the government is prepared to borrow to support the economy.
would be consistent with Ms Truss' position that the UK needs to break free of the Treasury's strict spending rules.
Nevertheless, the estimated £100bn is a sizeable sum to borrow at the same time as cutting taxes and boosting spending on defence and it could end up costing more than that, given the fluctuating price of wholesale gas. 
""One of the dangers here is that it could even be more expensive than £100bn,"" said Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, contrasting it with the Covid-prompted furlough scheme, which cost £60bn-£70bn.
""There has to be a risk that energy prices stay high for a long time, perhaps even up to three or four years,"" he said. ""Then this starts being baked into public spending long-term."" 
f UK government borrowing hit its highest level for eight years on Tuesday, with the yield on ten-year bonds rising above 3%. That reflects the market's expectation that the government will have to borrow more and means any future borrowing will be more expensive.
Mr Johnson said the plan to borrow to support energy bills was only one you would adopt ""if you can't think of anything else"" because it amounted to subsidising everybody's gas use, when the higher price suggested there was not enough gas available. That could lead to rationing, he suggested, and would mean high-income households would benefit by a much larger amount than those at the lower end.
How is the rising cost of living affecting you? Get in touch.
Government sources say that over time, new energy supply measures - such as cutting the link between renewable sources and the gas price - will lower costs while a growing economy will shrink the proportion of overall debt to the size of the economy. 
Businesses are also expected to be offered some relief in the plan set to be announced on Thursday.
Unlike households, businesses are not protected by an energy price cap. Many fixed-rate deals for business expire this October, exposing thousands of firms to full costs that could rise by four or five times or more. Thousands would go bust or cut their wage bills by firing staff.
recise mechanism to help business may be more complicated and would be reviewed more frequently but reports suggest it could see the government mandate energy firms to offer specific reductions on the unit price of the energy businesses use. 
Including businesses could easily push the cost of the government's energy plan over £100bn. 
Alex Veitch of the British Chambers of Commerce said: ""It is encouraging that the government is seriously considering the support it can give to businesses during these very difficult times.
""But it remains to be seen whether these plans will go far enough in offering the help that many firms so desperately need.""
Craig Beaumont from the Federation of Small Businesses said: ""This commitment looks very promising, and arguably the best reassurance that small businesses need that some form of help with bills will follow - not just for households. 
""The scope and reach of the help is going to be absolutely crucial to save hundreds of thousands of small businesses this winter."""	/news/business-62801913
politics	Tory leadership: Kemi Badenoch backs Rishi Sunak to be the next PM	"Kemi Badenoch has ruled herself out of the race to be the next prime minister, throwing her weight behind Rishi Sunak.
Ms Badenoch - who made a big impact in the last Tory leadership contest - said in The Times that Mr Sunak was ""the serious, honest leader we need"".
rnational trade secretary joins a growing list of Sunak backers, even though the ex-chancellor has yet to officially declare he is standing.
Former prime minister Boris Johnson is also gaining supporters.
But claims by his campaign team that he had reached the threshold of 100 MPs needed to secure place in the first round of voting were met with scepticism by Mr Sunak's supporters.
ged the Johnson camp to release a list of names, as the number of MPs to have gone on the record as backing the ex-PM is considerably smaller.
BBC understands Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson were due to meet face-to-face earlier on Saturday. It was postponed for reasons that are not clear, but may still go ahead later. Neither side is commenting on what is to be discussed, although there is speculation they will seek to avoid a potentially damaging contest.
Only Penny Mordaunt has officially launched a campaign to be the next PM, since nominations opened on Friday.
Ms Badenoch is seen as a rising star on the right of the Conservative Party but she had not attracted any public support from MPs urging her to stand for leader this time.
She said: ""Mrs Thatcher won the public's trust and three elections in a row by making it about us, not about her. We need someone who can do the same. I believe that person is Rishi Sunak.""
Another leading figure on the right of the party, former Brexit secretary Lord Frost, has also backed Mr Sunak.
According to the BBC's running total of MPs who have gone on the record with support, Mr Sunak has 122 backers, to Mr Johnson's 53 and Ms Mordaunt's 23.
fuls have until 14:00 BST on Monday to find 100 backers. If any candidate reaches 156 nominations out of the 357 Tory MPs the race will be reduced to two candidates, as there will not be enough MPs left to support a third candidate.
It will then go to an online ballot of the Conservative party membership, with the result to be announced on Friday. 
But if the party's MPs get behind just one candidate, we could have a new prime minister by Monday afternoon.
Polling suggests Mr Johnson would be favourite to win a members' vote. 
Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg and Transport Secretary Anne Marie Trevelyan -  plus former home secretary Priti Patel - have thrown their weight behind Mr Johnson.
His supporters say he is the only contender to have the backing of the voting public after winning the 2019 general election. Mr Johnson still has a Parliamentary investigation hanging over him over whether he lied to MPs about Covid lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street.
Some leading figures in the party have reacted with horror to the prospect of a second Johnson premiership, with former leader Lord Hague warning the party would enter a ""death spiral"".
Mr Sunak's supporters include former chancellor and health secretary Sajid Javid, Security Minister Tom Tugendhat and former deputy prime minister Dominic Raab.
Pointing to the parliamentary probe facing Mr Johnson, Mr Raab told the BBC: ""We cannot go backwards. We cannot have another episode of the Groundhog Day, of the soap opera of Partygate"". 
He said he was ""very confident"" Mr Sunak would stand, adding: ""I think the critical issue here is going to be the economy. Rishi had the right plan in the summer and I think it is the right plan now.""
Launching her campaign on Twitter on Friday, Ms Mordaunt said she would ""unite our country, deliver our pledges and win the next [general election]"".
Mordaunt backer Conservative MP Bob Seely said ""I think we owe the country a collective responsibility to apologise"" and said he believes Ms Mordaunt has the best chance of providing ""unity and leadership"" within the party.
Among those to have ruled themselves out of the race are Defence Secretary Ben Wallace - who has said he is ""leaning"" towards supporting Mr Johnson - and current Chancellor Jeremy Hunt. 
Boris Johnson was ejected from office in July after a string of scandals, but the replacement chosen by the Tory Party, Liz Truss, lasted just 45 days, making her the shortest-serving prime minister in British history. 
She stood down on Thursday, after a series of humiliating U-turns forced on her by an adverse reaction to her tax policies in the financial markets."	/news/uk-politics-63353097
politics	Gwent Police: Welsh ministers might back wider investigation	"A minister says the Welsh government will consider a call for a national inquiry into England and Wales police forces, after allegations of misogyny, corruption and racism at Gwent Police. 
Gwent Chief Constable Pam Kelly has said Wiltshire Police will independently investigate Gwent Police.
But ex-Crown Prosecution Service head Nazir Afzal wants a wider probe.
Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""We'll consider the call before coming out with a more considered view"".
Welsh government has no jurisdiction over policing matters, which are the responsibility of the Home Office within the UK government.
Gwent investigation has been compared by Labour MP Ruth Jones to ""police officers marking police officers' homework"". 
Wiltshire Police said it was ""not uncommon for police forces to request other forces to take on independent investigations"".
Gwent Police is not commenting on Ms Jones's criticism.
review emerged on the weekend after the Sunday Times reported on messages between serving and retired officers.
A solicitor acting for the family of a policeman whose phone sparked the probe said on Monday that he had ""never seen anything like"" the messages they found.
Craig Court said messages on the phone of Gwent Police officer Ricky Jones, who died in 2020, revealed affairs, corruption, misogyny and homophobia.
Mr Afzal, until recently a Welsh government advisor, said a national inquiry is needed because problems are ""likely to be everywhere"" across forces in Wales and England.
""The vast majority of police officers are very good at what they do and clearly not bigoted or prejudiced, but there is a sizable minority, unfortunately, who are racist, sexist, homophobic, corrupt, and there's nothing in my mind worse than a bigot with a warrant card,"" he said. 
Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Gething said there had been ""no hesitation"" from Gwent Chief Constable Pam Kelly in expressing ""how appalled"" she had been ""at the allegations"" and ""the investigation is taking place by a separate police force"".
""All of us should be able to have trust and confidence in the police and if it is revealed there are people who wear the uniform who absolutely should not it is, of course, a point of concern,"" he said. 
""I've seen the wider issues in relation to the [Metropolitan Police] and others, I'd want to reflect and consider the call from Nazir Afzal and others for a wider investigation, and to understand how that will practically make a difference.""
Mr Gething said he wanted ""to make sure that we all get the police force that we deserve as citizens, but also that all the many decent men and women who serve in our police forces"" have officers ""alongside them that won't embarrass and shame them in the way that, I'm afraid, far too many have done"". 
""So I think we'll consider the call before coming out with a more considered view on Nazir Afzal's suggestion,"" he added."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63636853

politics	PMQs: Rishi Sunak 'shocked' by allegations about Tory peer Michelle Mone	"Starmer: How did Baroness Mone get taxpayers' money?
Rishi Sunak said he was ""shocked"" to read allegations about Baroness Mone, adding it was ""absolutely right"" that she is no longer attending the Lords.
r is taking a leave of absence amid claims she benefited from a firm she recommended for a Covid contract.
Asked about the allegations at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Sunak said she ""no longer has the Conservative whip"".
A spokesperson for the peer said: ""Baroness Mone's legal team are dealing with this witch-hunt situation.""
Downing Street said not having the Tory whip was an automatic consequence of her requesting a leave of absence from the House of Lords.
Baroness Mone has been linked to PPE Medpro, which won government contracts worth £203m to supply masks and medical gowns during the pandemic, after she recommended it to ministers.
An investigation in the Guardian based on leaked documents alleged Baroness Mone had financially benefited from the company.
At PMQs, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asked Mr Sunak: ""How did his colleague Baroness Mone end up with nearly £30m of taxpayers' money in her bank account?""
Mr Sunak told him: ""The one thing we know about him is he is a lawyer, he should know there is a process in place. It is right that that process concludes. I hope that it is resolved promptly.""
He added: ""Like everyone else I was absolutely shocked to read about the allegations.
""It's absolutely right that she is no longer attending the House of Lords and therefore no longer has the Conservative whip.""
Baroness Mone's spokesman said on Tuesday she was taking a leave of absence from the House of Lords ""in order to clear her name of the allegations that have been unjustly levelled against her"".
Lords' standards watchdog is investigating the peer over her alleged involvement in procuring contracts for PPE Medpro, although this has been paused ""while the matter is under investigation by the police or another agency as part of a criminal investigation"".
Baroness Mone has consistently denied any ""role or function"" in the company, and her lawyers have previously said she is ""not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity"".
government has committed to releasing documents to MPs surrounding the award of contracts to the PPE Medpro firm, after Labour won a vote in the Commons on Tuesday."	/news/uk-politics-63888582

Filming of Rust will continue in January, with Ms Hutchins' widower Matthew on board as the movie's executive producer.
All parties believe Ms Hutchins' death was an accident, her husband said.
A lawsuit filed against Mr Baldwin, producers and others, had alleged violations of industry standards.
xact terms of the settlement, which is subject to court approval, have not been disclosed. 
In a statement, Mr Hutchins said that ""all the original principal players"" would be involved when filming resumes, which he said would be a way to ""pay tribute"" to his late wife's final work. 
""I have no interest in engaging in recriminations or attribution of blame,"" he added.
""All of us believe Halyna's death was a terrible accident.""
Mr Baldwin posted his reaction in a statement on Instagram: ""We are pleased to announce today the settlement of the civil case filed on behalf of the family of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.
""Throughout this difficult process, everyone has maintained the specific desire to do what is best for Halyna's son.
""We are grateful to everyone who contributed to the resolution of this tragic and painful situation.""
Rust director Joel Souza, who was also injured in the shooting on the Bonanza Creek Ranch set near Santa Fe in New Mexico, said in a statement on Wednesday that he would now devote himself ""to honouring Halyna's legacy and making her proud"".
""Though certainly bittersweet, I am pleased that together, we will now complete what Halyna and I started,"" he said.

politics	Gerard Hutch: Jonathan Dowdall can begin evidence in murder trial	"Former Sinn Féin councillor Jonathan Dowdall can begin giving evidence on Monday in the Gerard Hutch murder trial, an Irish court has decided.
Mr Hutch is charged with the murder of David Byrne, 33, at a Dublin hotel in 2016, which he denies.
Dowdall was due to stand trial for the same offence but in October he pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of facilitating the murder.
He is serving a four-year sentence for the offence.
Before he takes to the witness box, Dowdall has to be present in court to hear a Garda (Irish police) superintendent from the state's witness protection programme give evidence that his admission to the programme is not performance-related to the evidence he gives against Gerard Hutch.
f superintendent in charge of witness protection is travelling abroad and could only give evidence by Zoom.
urt agreed it was preferable to take a ""live witness"" - albeit of a lower rank - than depend on the vagaries of technology.
rial has been adjourned until Monday.
Mr Byrne was shot dead during a boxing weigh-in at the Regency Airport Hotel in Dublin in February 2016.
Dowdall was sentenced after admitting to facilitating a murder by renting a hotel room for the killers.
Lawyers for Mr Hutch, 59, had argued at the Special Criminal Court in Dublin that Dowdall's willingness to give evidence against their client was a quid pro quo for having the murder charges dropped.
residing judge in the three-judge non-jury court, Ms Justice Tara Burns, rejected that argument.
Dowdall has agreed to take part in the Irish witness protection programme in order to give evidence at the trial.
During the voir-dire - trial within a trial - on the admissibility of Dowdall's evidence, the judge had asked the prosecution about the standing of Dowdall's application to join the state's witness protection programme.
wyer for the prosecution indicated that he was not able to answer.
judge had indicated that she expected an answer on Friday.
On Friday, a barrister for the prosecution indicated that it could be mid-January at the earliest before a final decision is made on Dowdall's application to join the witness protection programme."	/news/world-europe-63918738
business	Cost of living: Pubs face bleak future, boss warns	"Pub bosses say they fear for the industry amid rising bills and customers spending less
Pubs face a ""bleak"" future as costs climb and customers rein in their spending, a pub chain boss has warned.
Clive Watson said refurbishment plans were on hold and some kitchens may have to close at quiet times because of the rising price of food and energy.
monthly inflation figure, published on Wednesday, was 10.7% in November, down from 11.1% in October.
It means prices are still rising, but the rate at which they are going up is slowing.
""I don't want to be sensationalist about it, but it is bleak,"" said Mr Watson, co-founder of City Pub Company, which runs 45 bars, with four in Wales.
""After Christmas, trade is always very quiet and, I think, it is going to be a long haul for operators who, let's face it, have had two years of Covid challenges.
""These are businesses who have been through a lot of pain already,"" he said, while speaking from the company's Newport bar, the Potters Pub.
""To go into the new year with all the high costs we have talked about, plus consumers feeling the pinch as well, I genuinely fear for a lot of pubs' long-term survival.""
He said Christmas bookings were ahead of the same period in 2019, but spending per head was down as ""the office credit card isn't as flexible as it has been in the past"". 
mbination of staff shortages, higher running costs and lower customer spending meant pubs were reluctant to invest in expanding their businesses.
""Why would I open a new pub in Cardiff for Newport if I am struggling to get the staff into existing pubs?"" he said. 
""We are curtailing our expansion and refurbishment [plans], and really just focusing on what we have got.""
Businesses which supply the hospitality sector are also facing tough trading conditions.
mos and Lilford Brewery, in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, employed seven people this time last year, but now managing director Rob Lilford is the only full-time staff member.
He said pubs were ordering less beer, and the costs of producing it had increased significantly this year.
""We faced a 30% rise in the price of the raw material, the grain that beer is made from,"" he said.
flict in Ukraine, as well as increased gas and electricity costs, are thought to have pushed prices higher.
""That was in January, and we are now expecting a higher rise than that this January - something in the region of 40 to 45%, and that is Ukraine-driven, as well as energy,"" he said.
Mr Lilford sells his beer to the Rising Sun in Abersychan, Torfaen, where owner and landlord Gerwyn Evans said it was ""a scary time"" to run a hospitality business.
""It's a rollercoaster,"" he added. 
""When you hear on the news that the price of a pint has gone up 5p or 10p, that's the brewer's cost.
""That's not necessarily our costs for electric, gas, staff costs and wages. 
""There are many other aspects to the price of a pint of beer and how much you can safely charge and still get people through the door.""
Mr Evans, who is secretary of a group representing local landlords, said the trend was for pubs to open for only a few days a week.
""They are shortening their weeks, they are opening later in the day because the trade simply isn't there,"" he said.
Rising Sun has diversified to offer specials such as a pie and pint night, quizzes and curry nights to entice new customers.
""We are quite fortunate that the locals do support the pub, but it's either use it or lose it,"" he said.
""So many pubs are closing, it's so sad that part of our national heritage and traditions are sadly going down, one by one.""
Last month, Michelle Knight, who runs the Six Bells in Coity, Bridgend, told BBC Wales how she had halved draught beer and cider selections to keep costs down while running the pub's cooling system.
Dr Siwan Mitchelmore, a university lecturer at Bangor Business School, said pubs were ""being squeezed from both ends"".
""They are facing their customers directly and, as the cost of living has increased, it has also risen for businesses as well as their customers,"" she said.
""And we see that the number of people spending in these areas is falling because they are worrying more about heating their homes than about non-essential spending."""	/news/uk-wales-63948471

business	Asos shoppers return more as rising prices hit	"Asos has warned that full-year profits will fall sharply as cash-strapped customers return more items to the online clothing retailer.       
mpany said that while sales rose in the three months to the end of May, profit had been hit by ""inflationary pressures on consumers"". 
Asos's chief operating officer Mat Dunn said it was ""too early"" to tell how long this behaviour would continue.  
But the firm expects adjusted pre-tax profit to fall to between £20m to £60m.
It is far below Asos's prediction in January when it said annual profit was set to reach between £110m and £140m, and a sharp decline from the previous financial year when it hit £193.6m.
Asos said the higher rate of returns was adding to warehouse and delivery costs. It said profit would be impacted if it had to cut prices to shift goods.
Over the three months to 31 May, Asos said sales rose by 4% to £987.9m, driven by the UK and the US and the resolution of supply chain issues which had dogged its performance over the first half of its year. This ""led to an improved stock profile and increased newness and availability"".
But Mr Dunn said: ""What is now clear, based on the significant increase in returns rates that we have seen, is that this inflationary pressure is increasingly impacting our customers' shopping behaviour.""
Asos's share price plunged by 15% to a 12-year low of 987.5p following the update.
Online clothing retailer N Brown also said rising inflation - which reached a a 40-year high in April - had affected consumer confidence since the start of its financial year when its sales fell by 2.1% to £165.1m in the first quarter.
""Sales volumes since the start of the financial year have been softer, reflecting various well-documented pressures on consumer confidence, which are showing no signs of abating in the short-term,"" said N Brown's chief executive Steve Johnson. 
""As these pressures persist, we expect the trading environment to remain challenging and will, therefore, continue to take actions to mitigate the effects wherever possible.""
Meanwhile, Asos announced it had found a replacement chief executive after Nick Beighton resigned last October. Chief commercial officer José Antonio Ramos Calamonte is taking on the top job with immediate effect. He joined Asos nearly 18 months ago from Portugal's Salsa Jeans.
Asos has also appointed Jørgen Lindemann as its new chairman. Currently a non-executive director, Mr Lindemann will take over the role from Ian Dyson who will step down on 1 August."	/news/business-61822539
health	Bristol family hopes US drug could save Elaiya's life	"family of a toddler with an extremely rare form of leukaemia have said they want to take her to the US for potentially life-saving treatment.
Elaiya, from Bristol, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with a GLIS2 genetic mutation, which puts her at high risk.
Despite finding a stem cell match this was ""sadly unsuccessful"", her parents said.
w want to raise more than £600,000 to pay for new treatment.
""This is the last chance to save our daughter's life,"" Elaiya's dad Muzahir said.
raised more than £87,000 in just over seven days - including a £10,000 donation from the Azaylia Foundation - set up after the death of the daughter of former Coventry City footballer Ashley Cain.
About 100 children and adults under the age of 19 are diagnosed with AML in the UK every year, according to the charity Blood Cancer.
But Elaiya's rare gene means that the standard course of treatment - chemotherapy - would not cure her. 
Muzahir said: ""If you have a specific mutation, it just makes things a hundred times more complicated. 
""As far as we are aware, Elaiya is the only child in the UK to have this genetic rearrangement, or mutation.""
family had hoped to attempt a bone marrow transplant, but while a compatible donor was found, the transplant was not possible after chemotherapy failed to bring Elaiya into remission pre-transplant. 
It was decided to take the riskier option of using a mismatched umbilical cord instead, and despite that transplant going well, it was also failed to achieve remission.
Her parents now hope to fly her to Houston, Texas, where she would be admitted at MD Anderson Cancer Centre for several months to receive stage one of a two-stage treatment plan. 
A drug called STRO-002 has been developed which, her parents said, specifically targets Elaiya's gene mutation. If this is successful, it will bring Elaiya into remission. 
Stage two of her treatment would explore CAR-T therapy or a bone marrow transplant. 
""She will hopefully be the first international patient to test this new drug over in the States, called STRO, so she could be making history, and we are just praying we can get her out there on time,"" Muzahir said.
He added that Elaiya's leukaemia was progressing tenfold every two to three weeks and they were ""really pressed against time"".
""So far this drug has only been trialled on 20 children in the world... of those 20 children about nine of them have successfully gone into remission so at the moment it's 50-50, but 50-50 is better than nothing,"" Muzahir said.
""Elaiya is a fighter, she has been fighting and is not going to stop fighting, so we owe it to her to do everything in our capability to get her out there.""

He retired from racing in September 2021, having originally planned to retire at the end of last year.
Farmer won the National Superstock 600 title in 2011 and National Superstock 1000cc successes followed in 2012 and 2018, while he also won the British Supersport title in 2017.

Scottish Tourism Alliance (STA) survey found almost 40% of businesses reported a decrease in spending since May 2021.
Business say the drop-off is due to the cost-of-living crisis and the appeal of international travel.

More than 700 tourism businesses across Scotland took part in the survey, which ran from 17 May to 8 June.
A record 55% of businesses reported that their international bookings for June-August were lower in comparison with May 2019 - before the pandemic.
It also highlighted problems with staffing and recruitment, with 60% of hotels saying they are unable to trade effectively at current staffing levels.

He said: ""The cost-of-living crisis is hitting Scotland's tourism sector very hard on many levels.
""People are hesitant about committing to booking a break due to household financial challenges and uncertainty and with the rise of energy prices and supplier costs, many businesses are finding the level of recovery almost static.
""This impacts the ability for our tourism industry to remain competitive globally; we struggle to compete on price and we're unable to retain and attract the quality of staff required to deliver the level of service demanded by today's consumers.""
He added that the disruption caused by rail strikes made it harder for the industry to thrive.
Malcolm Roughead, chief executive of VisitScotland, said the survey underlined some of the challenges facing the tourism industry but also highlighted some positives.
He said: ""There are some encouraging signs with the return of international visitors and consumer research which shows more UK residents expect to take an overnight domestic trip between June and September than in 2021."""	/news/uk-scotland-61881242
health	New Year Honours 2023: Covid vaccine centre nurse, 70, honoured	"A 70-year-old nurse who screened thousands of patients at Covid vaccination centres has been recognised in the King's New Year Honours list.
Mary Buck, from Swanage in Dorset, said older centre workers had been fearful of catching and spreading the disease.
She previously ran services for St John Ambulance as well as helping to install community defibrillators in Swanage.
Mrs Buck is awarded a British Empire Medal for services to the NHS and the Dorset community.
She said her Covid vaccination centres at the Bournemouth International Centre and in Wareham depended on the work of retired doctors and nurses who were fearful of bringing the virus home to their families.
""My husband's that bit older so it was a thing coming through the front door and straight into the shower,"" she said.
""We sat opposite ends of the lounge and I was sleeping in the spare room for a few months.""
Mrs Buck, who had considered retiring from nursing, said she kept up her medical registration mainly because of Covid.
She was previously appointed Commander of the Order of St John for her work with the St John Ambulance service.
She said: ""Training St John Ambulance cadets who went on to become A&E consultants and senior police officers is probably the biggest joy of my life.""
Elsewhere in Dorset, Claire Whitaker, from Poole, is appointed CBE for services to the arts and culture.
Ms Whitaker led Southampton's shortlisted bid to be UK City of Culture in 2025.
Russell Corn, from Wimborne, who is chair of trustees at the Special Boat Service Association, becomes a CBE for charitable service.
Lt Cdr Tony Eagles, from Sherborne, a former helicopter specialist at the Civil Aviation Authority, is appointed MBE for services to aviation safety."	/news/uk-england-dorset-64129128
health	Rise in hospital falls and bed sores since pandemic	"umber of falls and bed sores recorded in Scotland's hospitals has increased since the Covid pandemic, new data shows. 
NHS staffing pressures and the deconditioning effect of the Covid lockdown creating more frail patients are being blamed for the rise.
Scottish government paused work on a national prevention strategy for falls when the pandemic started.
rategy has now been shelved and experts argue this is a mistake. 
Figures released by NHS Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) show that in 2018-19 - the last full year before the Covid pandemic - a total of 26,489 falls were recorded in hospitals. 
In 2021-22, the total was 27,767 but this does not include data for two health boards, NHS Fife and Dumfries and Galloway, as they are not currently part of the HIS programme to record falls.
Dawn Skelton, a professor in ageing and health at Glasgow Caledonian University, said there was a ""maelstrom"" of problems fuelling the increase in hospital falls. 
She said: ""You've got staffing issues definitely but you've also got people who are going in to hospital a step change frailer than they were pre-Covid because of what has happened with all the restrictions. 
""The people in these falls figures have got no reserves, blow on them and they will fall over, so they are at more risk when they go in.""
Prof Skelton said it was time to resurrect the Scottish government's falls and fracture prevention strategy as its ""value now cannot be underestimated"".
She added: ""Falls and frailty are one of the main causes of long hospital stays and demands on social care and without a spotlight on both the management, but also prevention, the financial and staffing demands on NHS and social care will only rise.""
Recorded instances of bed sores, which form when hospital patients are stuck in one position for too long, have increased in Scotland's biggest health boards.
Figures released by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde show that in 2018-19 the board recorded 239 pressure ulcers in its hospitals, 439 the following year and 537 in 2021-22. 
In NHS Lothian, the number of bed sores recorded increased from 780 in 2018-19 to 1,120 last year. 
Both boards have different ways of counting pressure ulcers, not all of which were acquired in hospital. 
NHS Lothian board papers from April suggested a recent increase in falls and pressure ulcers was a ""reflection of the pressures on the system"".
Minutes from the board's healthcare governance committee record that Gillian McAuley, acute nurse director for NHS Lothian, advised that the ""use of supplementary staffing, the number of patients with acute delirium, reduced patient visiting as well as increased activity in the system all contributed to an increase in falls"".
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it has ""a robust process in place for recording pressure damage"" and added ""we constantly strive to reduce avoidable damage through a robust system of multi-disciplinary learning and improvement"".
Alison MacDonald, of NHS Lothian, said: ""In recent years, there has been a concentrated effort to better record and report pressure ulcers. We have invested more into staff training and our expert tissue viability team, and put in place a nurse consultant role.""
Scottish government said there is currently no plan to publish a national falls strategy as a result of what it described as a very changed NHS landscape following the pandemic.
A spokeswoman said: ""Falls prevention and reducing harm caused by falls is crucial for maintaining the health, wellbeing and independence of older people and supports our ambition to make Scotland the best place in the world to grow old.""
NHS Dumfries and Galloway and Fife both said they routinely log and document falls in their hospitals. 
An ongoing HIS review is expected to re-establish consistent data submission on the likes of falls and pressure ulcers from all of Scotland's health boards. "	/news/uk-scotland-63569147
entertainment	The Governess, Anne Hegerty, on autism, quizzing and her challenges with everyday life	"Anne Hegerty is best known as her ruthless television alter-ego, The Governess, who regularly puts wannabe-quiz champions firmly in their place on The Chase. But the former journalist, who was diagnosed with autism later in life, reveals that while quizzing comes easily to her, she finds everyday tasks extremely difficult.
Every morning the chaser pours herself a large cup of coffee and sits down to complete 25 quizzes. She says it's ""the easiest part"" of her day. 
""After that I do the difficult stuff, like going upstairs and having a shower and getting dry. And then putting some clothes on and making sure they are clean, and then actually getting myself out of the house.
""All of that is hard work,"" she told the BBC Access All podcast. ""It feels like a I've climbed a mountain.""
Hegerty, 64, found a love for knowledge early on in life.
""I was a nerdy child and I discovered that I could learn things off by heart,"" she says of the skill she hasn't lost.
""This morning I was trying to get back to sleep, so I decided to reel off American presidents working backwards. And by the time I got to Lincoln, I thought…I obviously don't want to sleep and I just got up.""
Hegerty turned that skill into a profession when she joined the hit ITV quiz show The Chase in 2010 as The Governess, in a role which sees her alternately intimidate, deride and occasionally flirt with contestants to put them off their game.
Her 12-year stint on the show led her to appearing on the 2018 season of I'm A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here, Brain of Britain, Mastermind and the Australian version of The Chase.
But she has faced huge challenges behind the gloss of her TV career.
Hegerty was diagnosed with autism aged 45, after she watched a TV programme about the developmental disability and recognised some of the traits in herself. 
She experiences sensory issues and struggles with loud noises when she's tired or stressed. 
Daily chores take huge amounts of energy for her to complete and when she is feeling particularly stressed, she has to follow instructions which break down household tasks, step-by-step, like sorting out her washing.
""It'll say 'go upstairs, take washing bag, put on floor, sort out tights, put in this container, sort out hot wash, put in that container, take bag downstairs, put tights in washing machine'.
""I have to just write it all out. I need a lot of time to kind of get all my neurons lined up and pointed at something before I do it,"" she says.
Before joining The Chase, Hegerty says she was ""really struggling"" having lost her job as a copy editor and proof-reader after two decades. 
""I was good at the proofreading, but I was not good at actually getting the thing finished, parcelling it up and sending out an invoice,"" she says.
Her ""low point"" hit in 2008. Hegerty was behind on rent, unopened bills littered her hallway and the bailiffs turned up.
On the latest episode of Access All, listen to Anne talk more about life as The Governess, being diagnosed with autism in her forties and her theory about why bailiffs are like vampires...
Plus BBC News correspondent, Sean Dilley, describes the heartbreak he's going through having retired his guide dog, Sammy, after 10 years together.
Fortuitously, around this time, an employee from her housing association also visited and realised Hegerty needed help. 
""She told me, 'don't worry, we'll fix this',"" Hegerty recounts. ""She got me a social worker, a lovely bloke called Jeff.""
Jeff helped Hegerty access funding from her utilities provider to help pay her bills as well as applying for other benefits including Jobseeker's Allowance and Disability Living Allowance.
""It just gave me a breathing space where I could work out what was going on,"" she says.
Hegerty's love for knowledge hadn't abated and it was around a year later she discovered the UK's high-level quizzing circuit.
She turned up to her first quiz in Liverpool as an unknown. The BBC happened to be auditioning quizzers for the second series of Are You An Egghead? and Hegerty gave it a go. She filmed the episode and ended up coming third.
""At the time I didn't realize what a tiny, incestuous world quizzing is,"" she laughs. ""Soon enough everybody in quizzing knew I'd done really well. They were like: 'Who is this new woman?'""
Hegerty went on to the British leg of the Quizzing World Championships, where a chance encounter with a fellow quiz aficionado made an impact.
""He told me that he had just finished making the pilot series of a new show called The Chase, and he said 'you should watch it, it's going to be really good'.""
-off came from Mark ""The Beast"" Labbett, who has been on every season of The Chase since its inception. When the chance to audition for its second season popped up, Hegerty went for it - and the rest is history.
Looking back, Hegerty says she is glad she sought out her autism diagnosis because it gave her chance to reflect on how her brain works. It also gave her insight into how neurotypical people behave, including those she quizzes against. 
""I look back and there are things that I resented at the time but I now think, 'actually, they were trying to be nice',"" she says. ""Everyone's just trying to figure it out.""

health	Veterans' experiences shared in comic book, Coming Home	"A comic book has been created with veterans sharing their experiences as a way to deal with mental health issues.
Graham ""Stan"" Mathews said it had been ""amazing"" in helping him to come terms with what he witnessed while serving in Northern Ireland in the 1970s.
He said Coming Home had brought to life issues which had been going ""round and round in my head"" for years.
""Northern Ireland has had a lasting impact on me these last 48 years,"" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.
gy has been created by Cardiff based Re-Live charity which launched an online life story group for veterans during the Covid pandemic.
Mr Mathews from Carmarthenshire joined the forces when he was 15 years old and was posted to Northern Ireland three years later.
He said: ""My story is now real. It's not in my head... it's got its own life.""
Karin Diamond, artistic director for arts and health group Re-Live and co-editor of the comic, said the idea came about as a client had been a big fan of the Commando Comics series.
""We wanted to connect to veterans and veterans' families and the general public about some of the mental health experiences that veterans are living with every day,"" she said.

business	Royal Mail staff to strike on six more days in run-up to Christmas	"Royal Mail workers are to strike on six days in December, including Christmas Eve, usually one of the busiest days of the year for the company.
f four days already announced for late November, around the Black Friday shopping weekend.
Communication Workers Union (CWU) said ""the livelihoods of postal workers"" were at stake.
Royal Mail said changes to the business were ""not optional"".
g-running dispute revolves around pay, jobs and conditions at the privately-owned firm.
w strikes have been called for 9, 11, 14, 15, 23 and 24 December, the busiest time of the year for deliveries.
CWU which represents more than 115,000 postal workers at Royal Mail, said it still wanted a negotiated settlement with Royal Mail Group and would ""continue to engage the company to that end"".
""But those in charge of Royal Mail need to wake up and realise we won't allow them to destroy the livelihoods of postal workers,"" it said.
Last month Royal Mail proposed a ""pay-for-change"" offer which would include changes to workers' shift patterns including start times and Sunday working in exchange for a 9% pay rise spread over two years.
CWU rejected the offer describing the company's plans as the ""Uberisation"" of the postal service.
Royal Mail said:  ""Our preference is for an agreement with the CWU but the change we need is not optional.
""They should be focused on a resolution to this dispute for their members and the long-term health of the business, rather than damaging strike action,"" it said."	/news/business-63671301
health	No ambulance to meet helicopter patient at hospital	"A patient was airlifted to Glasgow Airport as no ambulances were available for a 300 yard transfer from the helipad at an East Ayrshire hospital.
ual, who was picked up by an air ambulance on Arran, was then driven 26 miles from the airport back to Crosshouse Hospital, near Kilmarnock.
Both the Scottish Ambulance Service and Scottish government have apologised for the delay.
A Tory MSP said the patient's experience was ""truly terrifying"".
Details of the case, first reported by LBC, emerged amid mounting winter pressures on the NHS.
resulted in an appeal by NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde for patients only to turn up at A&E if their situation is urgent or life-threatening.
And on Wednesday NHS Lothian confirmed relatives of some hospital patients are to be asked to provide care for their loved ones at home in a bid to free up beds.
In the latest example of the strain on the system it has emerged a patient was airlifted to Crosshouse earlier this month having taken unwell on the Isle of Arran.
But after the helicopter landed it became clear there were no ambulances available to complete the short journey from the helipad to the hospital.
Instead they were flown about 25 miles to Glasgow Airport where they they met an ambulance crew who drove them back to Kilmarnock. 
A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said: ""Whilst we are limited in what we can say due to patient confidentiality, we can confirm we transported a patient from Arran to Crosshouse Hospital via air ambulance on Thursday 8 December 2022. 
""Unfortunately, extended hospital turnaround times at Crosshouse Hospital at that time meant a delay to the ambulance and therefore the aircraft had to divert to Glasgow Airport to avoid icing in the bad weather. 
""We apologise for any distress caused.""
A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""We are aware of this incident and understand that the ambulance service are looking into the circumstances. 
""We expect steps to be taken to ensure incidents of this kind do not occur again, and we apologise to this patient for their experience and hope they are recovering well.""
Claire Burden, chief executive of NHS Ayrshire & Arran, said its hospitals were experiencing ""extremely high demand"" for unscheduled care services.
She apologised for the longer waiting times experienced by some patients, and said they were working with the Scottish Ambulance Service to reduce avoidable waits. 
Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane said the story was a damning indictment of the current state of the health service.
He added: ""This will have been a truly terrifying situation for this patient and my thoughts are with them. 
""It lays bare the total chaos that Humza Yousaf is presiding over in our NHS, despite the best efforts of dedicated ambulance crews.
""Going back and forth between different health boards, having already been in an air ambulance, will have caused huge distress and anxiety for this suffering patient.""
Dr Gulhane also called for the patient to be given an ""urgent apology"" after a chain of events he described as ""utterly shameful"".
Meanwhile, on Tuesday it emerged more than a third of people attending at A&E departments were not seen within the Scottish government's four-hour target in the first full week of December.
Data from Public Health Scotland (PHS) showed that in the week to 11 December, 62.4% of people were seen and subsequently admitted, transferred or discharged within the target time.
Scottish government aims to have 95% of people seen within the four-hour target.
But last month the country's hospitals recorded their worst ever accident and emergency waiting times.
In a separate development, NHS Lothian bosses are urging anyone asked to provide care for a relative on an interim basis while waiting for a package of social care to be put in place to ""give the request some serious consideration"".
rd's chief executive Calum Campbell said the move comes as the health service comes under ""unprecedented"" and ""sustained"" pressure.
It comes at a time when the NHS is dealing with large numbers of emergency patients, at the same time as medics are seeing an increase in respiratory illness.
Delayed discharge, where patients are medically well enough to leave hospital but have to stay while they wait for care arrangements to be put in place, is also increasing pressure on the service, the health board said."	/news/uk-scotland-64052318
health	Nottingham placenta error hampered baby death probe - coroner	"A coroner says an investigation into the death of a newborn baby at a hospital was compromised by the way the placenta was dealt with.
Quinn Lias Parker was born at Nottingham's City Hospital in July 2021 but died two days later from multiple organ failure.
It later emerged the placenta was dissected by pathology staff when it should have been preserved.
Hospital bosses said procedures had since been revised.
An inquest into Quinn's death, held in April, returned a narrative verdict.
It heard the baby's mother Emmie Studencki had been previously admitted to hospital a number of times after suffering bleeding.
But more details about what happened with the placenta have been made public in a coroner's report seen by the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
After Quinn's birth, Ms Studencki's placenta was sent from the hospital's maternity unit to pathology, where it was dissected - meaning it was cut up for examination. 
But Dr Elizabeth Didcock, assistant coroner for Nottinghamshire, said the dissection meant the post-mortem examination was compromised.
In a prevention of future deaths report, she detailed how Quinn was born in a ""poor condition"" and there was a ""high probability that he would not survive"" and therefore ""thought needed to be given to the preservation of the placenta"" to ensure it could be used in an examination.
""It is not clear to me exactly how the placenta was cut into after Quinn's death without discussion with the coroner,"" she said.
""What is clear is that the outcome has been highly detrimental to the independent investigation by the coroner and other agencies investigating the circumstances of this case.
""This death follows a number of similar early neonatal deaths in Nottingham, where the placenta has not been retained, and therefore key information regarding placental pathology has been lost.""
In a joint statement, Quinn's father Ryan Parker and Ms Studencki said: ""Let's be clear, this is the destruction of an organ, the prevention of a conclusive post-mortem and a significant challenge to the coroner's ability to investigate the cause of our son's death.
""The trust denied us a full post-mortem into our son's death.""
Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust said news of Quinn's death was not passed on to pathology staff before the procedure, and the dissection would not have happened if the information had arrived sooner.
Sharon Wallis, director of midwifery at the trust, said: ""We offer our sincere condolences to Ms Studencki and Mr Parker for the loss of baby Quinn.
""We are deeply sorry that we let them down with the care and communication that we provided both before and after Quinn's birth.
""We have changed the way we examine placentas, which includes introducing a longer 'stop' moment of four days, and an electronic alerting system to notify pathology if a baby sadly dies.
""In addition, we have increased the number of consultants on our labour suite, increased the number of consultant reviews and we have implemented a system to ensure women and families are reassessed for risk after each consultant review.""
rust is currently the subject of an independent review by senior midwife Donna Ockenden following several deaths and serious injuries in recent years.

Manchester City and England star said she had a ""crazy entrance into the world"" after being born in a toilet.
30-year-old footballer has opened up to mark World Prematurity Day.
""I probably was quite small when I started playing football, but it just meant I had to work a little bit harder,"" she said.
""And actually, once I did fill out, I probably overtook the bigger guys,"" said Stokes, who joined Sunderland's youth academy aged eight and by 16 was playing in the first team.
""I think that's what I'd say to other parents now - don't worry if they're small and if they might be a bit late to develop, because we catch up. 
""We need to let little premmie babies know they are strong and... very robust.""
Stokes and her partner Katie Harrington have a six-month-old son, Harlen, who was born six weeks early weighing 5lbs (2.3kg).
He needed to spend a week in hospital after being born via emergency Caesarean.
She said it was only since becoming a parent it had sunk in what an anxious time it must have been for her own mum.
""But it's interesting because when I do speak to my mum about it, she doesn't ever say, 'Oh, it was horrendous'... I feel like she must have blocked it out.""
She said she had two other siblings who were also premature and while they were healthy, ""everyone's experience isn't the same"".
Stokes said she had shared her story to help start conversations around what experiencing a premature or difficult birth could be like for those going through it.
""It's important we talk about it,"" she said. 
Her partner also had pre-eclampsia, which she became seriously unwell with.
""It was really scary... I remember thinking, 'Demi, just have a poker face' - because if I crumble, I'm not going to help Katie,"" she said. 
She believed the skills she learned as a footballer, in terms of mental focus and staying calm under pressure, helped in the moment. 
""But inside, I was panicking and I was worried, definitely,"" she shared. ""I think not until after, when she came home, then I was like, 'You were really poorly, you were really unwell'.""
Stokes added that both were doing well now - and despite being ""a little early"", Harlen's ""really filled out and thriving"".

technology	Ukraine sent dozens of 'dronations' to build army of drones	"Dozens of people have given their hobby and commercial drones to Ukraine after it appealed for ""dronations"" to help build its ""army of drones"".
untry is also asking for money to buy 200 military reconnaissance drones.
Ukrainian and Russian forces have used small consumer drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), in the war.
But Justin Bronk, of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), says while small drones are useful, tactics are adapting to counter them.
Small and commercial drones can provide a live view of the enemy's positions, he says.
""Both sides in Ukraine have been able to very rapidly exploit that real-time video picture, to call down artillery fire and quickly correct it so that it's very, very accurate, even when using old school unguided artillery, on to enemy forces,"" he said.
But he warned electronic counter-measures were becoming increasingly effective.
roposed army of drones is a complex programme involving procurement, maintenance and replacement, as well as pilot training, Ukraine says.
Col Oleksii Noskov, assistant commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, said: ""The army of drones will allow us to constantly monitor the 2,470km-long (1,535 miles) front line and to field an effective response to enemy attacks, using modern technology.""
Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, told the BBC via email that the first goal of the campaign was to purchase tactical drones which have a 100-mile range and are equipped with a sophisticated camera, GPS and mapping tools.
However, after studying the issue, he said ""our team understood that Ukraine's army still needed quadcopters"", and so he said the country was asking people to ""donate their own drones"".
Ukraine hopes to collect thousands of multi-use and commercial UAVs.
Drones which meet the minimum standards are being donated to Ukraine via two warehouses, one in Poland and the other in the US.
Mr Fedorov also wants companies to get involved, adding: ""This project is a great opportunity for drone manufacturers to test their equipment in harsh conditions.""
mpaign, which was launched on Friday, has already raised £5.7m, enabling the purchase of two military UAVs. Dozens of small drones had also been received, Mr Fedorov tweeted.
military ""warmate"" drones, according to Mr Bronk, are a type of loitering munition manufactured in Poland. According to the company's website, the drone ""constitutes a good alternative for anti-tank guided missiles"".
According to Mr Fedorov, hobby and commercial drones have already shown their effectiveness on the battlefield. 
Russia has also made use of them. 
Earlier this year, Mr Fedorov called on market leader DJI to stop selling drones in Russia and, in a significant intervention for a Chinese firm, it halted sales in both Russia and Ukraine.
""Russia is using hobby/commercial drones to strike and conduct reconnaissance in their unprovoked and unfair war,"" Mr Fedorov wrote.
""It is crucial that the world's largest commercial drone-maker, DJI, stopped sales in Russia.""
Valerii Iakovenko, co-founder of Ukrainian company DroneUA, told BBC News that DJI's action had pushed up costs to Ukraine, while Russia was still able to continue to obtain drones via Belarus.
His company had been supplying drones and robotics to the government since before the war.
Drones, along with Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet system and professional radio equipment, were now among the most sought-after technology, he said.
And even small ones were useful mostly providing field data, locating enemy troops and correcting artillery fire.
""A huge number of volunteer operators that joined the Ukrainian forces are also making a difference,"" Mr Iakovenko said.
""Drone pilots of small consumer drones are providing aerial intelligence along the whole front line.
""It is all about the speed of information exchange between the field and in the general staff, to make decisions almost immediately.""
Watch: The volunteers using drones to monitor Russian troops
Mr Bronk says Ukrainians in particular have been very inventive in finding ways to source and then use commercial, as well as military-grade drones.
udes ""using them as improvised loitering munitions to strike targets at significant distance, including, recently, an oil refinery in Rostov with a commercial grade UAV with an improvised warhead"".
But tactics, he warns, are changing.
""What's happened in the last couple of months in Donbas is that the Russians have managed to concentrate their electronic warfare assets and integrate them well with their ongoing operations. 
As a result, Mr Bronk says, whenever Ukraine sends up a small UAV using radio remote control ""the Russian electronic warfare kit picks it up and immediately either takes it over or just cuts the command link electronically and forces it to return"".
, instead of being flown by remote control, small drones have to be programmed to fly a set route and have targets identified when footage is analysed on their return. This slow process is of limited value against moving targets, he said.
Mr Bronk felt that what Ukraine needed were loitering munitions capable of targeting and attacking Russian electronic warfare systems. 
While hobbyist drones were useful, at the moment ""grassroots support in terms of generating military equipment is probably of as much value in terms of morale for the people who are contributing, as well as the people on the front lines"". "	/news/technology-62048403

health	Doctor warns about weight-loss operations abroad	"A senior doctor has warned people about the potential dangers of travelling abroad for weight-loss surgery.
Prof Alex Miras, a consultant at Altnagelvin Hospital, Londonderry, said more people were opting for surgeries overseas because of a lack of services in Northern Ireland.
He said he was seeing more people who needed emergency aftercare on return.
""Because more and more people are going, as a result there are more complications,"" he said.
""The percentage of these complications remains very low. 
""Even if those cases are still few, they are very memorable because they can be serious"".
Derry businessman Joseph McVeigh, 35, flew to Turkey a year ago to have a gastric sleeve fitted.
Since surgery he has lost six and a half stone and is delighted with his new lifestyle.
""Before, I would have eaten everything and anything - hunger woke me up, it was as if you heard a big bang in the street.
""At times I would have woken in the night and ate and would not have remembered it.""
His diet was all about ""big dinners followed by chocolate and lemonade at night"".
urning point was when he was helping his father who asked him to go up to the attic.
""I genuinely couldn't do it. I was too fat. That really knocked my confidence,"" he said.
He said he was apprehensive about the surgery, but he had the support of family and friends.
A year on from the surgery, he said he felt fantastic.
""My energy levels are through the roof... I am just oozing with happiness.""
He said he had followed the post-surgery regime and changed his lifestyle.
""Now, I can eat anything but I just can't eat a lot. About 80% of that raging hunger is gone.
""I have no regrets, I would do it again tomorrow .""
Almost two-thirds of adults in Northern Ireland are classed as overweight or obese.
Bariatric surgery is not available on the NHS in Northern Ireland. 
""The important thing to say is that most people who go abroad and come back do not have a complication,"" said Prof Miras, who is also an academic at Ulster University. 
""But they need to be followed up for life, for mutational complications, for deficiencies for example different vitamins and minerals, and sometimes even psychological complications but unusual - they need to be followed up.""
He said the most common complication was the development of a leak following surgery, which required more surgery.
Bariatric surgery, also known as weight-loss surgery, is used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese (having a body mass index of 40 or above or 35 plus other obesity-related health conditions).
Patients must have tried and failed to achieve clinically-beneficial weight loss by all other appropriate non-surgical methods and be fit for surgery.
wo most common types of weight loss surgery are:
Prof Miras said anyone considering travelling for weight-loss surgery needed to do their research.
""They need to understand the fact there are potential risks. It is important they travel to a place where they are certain they will receive good care,"" he said.
""They need to investigate and research it before they make the decision, to choose the country, the surgeon and the hospital where they are going to be operated on.
Prof Miras said he understood why people travelled for surgery.

business	Interest rate ‘rigger’ guilty conviction thrown out	"A British former trader has had a conviction in the US for ""rigging"" interest rates overturned in spite of pleading guilty. 
Mike Curtler, formerly of Deutsche Bank, was among 38 former traders and brokers prosecuted after the US Department of Justice declared their conduct illegal 10 years ago. 
But earlier this year a US appeal court decided no rules had been broken. 
Mr Curtler's lawyer said they were ""extremely pleased"" with the decision. 
In the past eight years, 38 former brokers and traders have been prosecuted over emails and messages asking colleagues to tweak their estimates of the cost of borrowing cash to suit their bank's commercial interests - a practice which the US Department of Justice declared to be illegal interest rate ""rigging"" in 2012, when it fined Barclays Bank for it. 
mates of the interest rates banks were paying were submitted each morning as part of the process of arriving at Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate), the index that tracks the cost of borrowing cash.
Just as the FTSE tracks the prices of shares, Libor tracks the interest rates banks are paying to borrow cash on the wholesale money markets. 
For the past 35 years, it has been used to set interest rates on millions of residential and commercial loans around the world. 
work out Libor each day, 16 banks answer a question - at what interest rate could they borrow money? They submit their answers and an average is taken.
gainst Mike Curtler and other traders consisted of messages and emails asking for those interest rates to be submitted ""high"" or ""low"".
Mike Curtler admitted he had acted on the emailed requests and, faced with the risk of up to 15 years in a US jail if he went to trial, pleaded guilty. 
But in January this year a US appeal court ruled that the requests were not illegal after all, acquitting former Deutsche Bank traders Gavin Black from Middlesex and Matt Connolly from New Jersey. 
Now US courts are acquitting even those who pleaded guilty, such as Mike Curtler, saying they must be viewed as innocent. 
""I'm very glad the US courts have decided that what we did was not criminal. The past decade has been horrible but hopefully we can now start to rebuild,"" Mr Curtler told the BBC. 
Mr Curtler's lawyer, David Krakoff, said: ""We are extremely pleased that Mike Curtler has been cleared and that the courts have decided that there was no wrongdoing whatsoever.""
A month ago New York court threw out the conviction of former trader Tim Parietti, 56, who had also pleaded guilty, ordering the government to repay a £1m fine. 
It leaves the UK as the only country in the world where convictions for ""rigging"" interest rates have, so far, been sustained. 
Nine have been convicted in the UK, including Tom Hayes, Peter Johnson, Jonathan Mathew, Alex Pabon, Jay Merchant, Christian Bittar, Philippe Moryoussef, Carlo Palombo and Colin Bermingham. "	/news/business-62801918

Catherine Fahey said her husband, Kyle, resorted to carrying her to their car and driving her to hospital.
She said she arrived just in time to be given ""clot-busting medication"".
East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said it was""deeply sorry"" but was experiencing ""immense, sustained pressure"" on its service.
Now recovering at home near Lincoln, the 34-year-old said that she knew from television adverts that she needed treatment as soon as possible.
She said doctors told her if she had waited for the ambulance she might have missed the chance of taking the medicine, which has to be taken within four hours.
""If I'd have waited the chances of what my life would have been like after would have been completely different,"" she said.
""I probably wouldn't have been able to have the clot-busting medication and the potential of being paralysed on my left hand side.""

He was told to take her to Accident and Emergency where she was treated straight away.
Mrs Fahey said she felt ""very lucky"" that she made it to hospital in time.

politics	Scottish parliament apologises after suffragette scarf row	"Alison Johnstone: ""We actively support and promote universal suffrage in a number of ways at Holyrood.""
Scottish Parliament's presiding officer has apologised after a woman was ejected from a committee meeting for refusing to remove a scarf in suffragette colours.
woman was asked to leave a session of the equalities committee, which was discussing proposed reforms to Scotland's gender recognition laws.
Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone later said her removal was an error.
She said suffrage colours were not banned from Holyrood.
woman, who had been sitting in the public seats, tweeted a picture of her green, purple and white scarf shortly after being removed from the meeting of the Equalities, Human Rights and Civil Justice Committee on Tuesday morning. 
Under the Twitter handle Obsolesence, she said: ""I have just been asked to remove my new scarf. I refused because its lovely & inoffensive.
""Apparently (the Scottish Parliament) believes these colours are unacceptable while several MSPs wear rainbow lanyards.""
urs have been associated with the suffragette movement, which campaigned for women to be given the right to vote in the early 20th century. More recently, they have also become associated with those opposed to changes to gender recognition laws.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wore a suffragette scarf to mark the centenary of women winning the right to vote in 2018, and the Scottish Conservatives said items bearing the colours are on sale in the Scottish Parliament gift shop.
Ms Johnstone later told the Holyrood chamber that staff had removed the woman due to visitor rules on ""the display of banners, flags or political slogans, including on clothing and accessories"".
MSPs regularly wear symbols associated with political causes during meetings of the parliament. 
Ms Johnstone told MSPs: ""Let me make one thing crystal clear - suffrage colours are not, and never have been, banned at the Scottish Parliament. 
""We actively support and promote universal suffrage in a number of ways at Holyrood and will continue to do so.""
residing officer said the woman was not ejected as a result of a request from any member of the committee.
She added: ""The action taken was an error, and I would like to apologise on behalf of the Parliament. The wearing of a scarf in those colours does not, in itself, breach the visitor code of conduct.  
""The parliament wishes people to engage with the democratic process, including observing elected representatives debate and make the law of the country."" 
woman's removal had prompted criticism from Conservative MSPs.
Rachael Hamilton, who was wearing suffragette colours in the chamber, thanked the presiding officer for making the clarification.
She said: ""I think it's important that you have confirmed that MSPs are treated exactly the same way as members of the public and the suffragette colours were not in breach of the guidelines set by this parliament.""
SNP MP Joanna Chery - a vocal critic of the gender reforms - tweeted that the removal of the woman was a ""disgraceful episode for Scottish democracy"", adding: ""This is not the Scotland I entered politics to promote. 
""It's completely out of step with what the suffragettes fought for, the spirit of the enlightenment and indeed the founding principles of the Scottish Parliament"". 
qualities committee is currently examining the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill. which aims to make it easier for people to change their legally-recognised gender.

health	Ballymena: GP surgery closures will have 'devastating effect'	"A GP has warned the closure of two surgeries in Ballymena could have a ""devastating effect"" on neighbouring practices.
urgeries have indicated that they intend to resign affecting around 7,000 patients.
Dr Susan Sproule, a GP in Ballymena, said taking on the extra patients ""dilutes the service"" provided.
Department of Health (DoH) said both practices were offering services as normal.
wo surgeries are among six based in the same health centre in Ballymena.
Dr Sproule, who runs another practice based in the centre, said her practice had not received any extra resources to deal with the potential extra patients.
She said: ""When we take on extra patients we're not just talking about GP time, we're talking about other members of the primary care team.
""If we don't have that extra resource it's very hard to provide a safe service.""
Department of Health confirmed one of the practices, Ballymena Family Practice, had found no one interested in taking over the running of the surgery.
It means the practice's 3,204 patients will be assigned to 18 neighbouring surgeries when it closes its doors on 1 January 2023.
rtment said additional funding would be provided to each practice for every additional patient they take on.
Dr Sproule warned the added pressure on her practice has left her considering if she might also be forced to hand back the contract for her own practice.
""We have to be truthful not only to our profession but to our patients and I think at some point patient safety has to come into this,"" she said.
""It is fundamental and if we can't provide a safe service we will have no other choice but to possibly hand our own contracts back.""
Across Northern Ireland, the number of GP practices has fallen by just under 9% in eight years according to Department of Health Figures.
Despite the decrease in practices, the number of GPs, excluding locums, has gone up by 20% to 1,419 since 2014.

sports	Bruce Anstey: 'The doctors don't know how I'm still here' - Kiwi road racer talks about cancer battle	"When Bruce Anstey announced in April 2018 that he would be sitting out the forthcoming road racing season because of illness it came as a major shock to the sport's closely knit fraternity.
It was widely known that the popular New Zealander had previously been diagnosed with and received treatment for cancer but news that the illness had returned was met with a wave of sympathy and concern.
Anstey's partner Anny revealed on a Facebook post at the time that he had ""multiple tumours in his lungs and a tumour on his spine and a blood clot on the lung"".
52-year-old's impressive racing CV to date includes 12 Isle of Man TT wins, plus 13 and 10 victories respectively at the Ulster Grand Prix and North West 200 international events.
But in addition to his rare talent and exploits on the track, it is the quietly-spoken Kiwi's affable personality and laid-back attitude that have endeared him to legions of road racing fans across the world.
""I had cancer 25 years ago and it decided to come back in 2018,"" explained Anstey.
""I've been struggling with that, going through all the chemotherapy again, it's been a bit of a slog.
""By the second half of 2019 I was just starting to come right and won the 250cc race at the Classic TT on the Isle of Man, then Covid hit and I just had to keep out of the way for the last couple of years as my immune system is all shot.
""It's all good now. I had another small operation in 2019 to get rid of the last of it and I've been clear since then although I am still having blood tests every three months.
""The first time I had the treatment I really struggled but 25 years on the drugs stop you feeling as sick so that was much better.
""It was still hard but it seemed a lot easier this time as I knew what I was in for.
""The doctors still don't know if the cancer was the original one or the new one. They don't know how I'm still here really, so I'm a bit of a mystery to them.""
Anstey's ability to contend for major wins despite competing at just a selected few meetings each season has confounded observers of the sport for years and his consistency is evidenced by the fact that he achieved at least one podium finish at all three major internationals for 14 consecutive years between 2002 and 2015.
Wellington rider was a Superbike TT winner in 2015, the same year that his achievements were recognised by his native country when he became a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the New Year Honours.
He is also a former lap record holder for both the Isle of Man TT Mountain Course and the Ulster Grand Prix course at Dundrod.
""I don't know if I'll do the main TT again as I don't think I'm strong enough to do six laps,"" said Anstey of his plans for the future.
""But I really want to get out in the Classic TT again - maybe do the 500 and 250 races - that's my goal and hopefully that will happen in 2022.
""I definitely want to do the Classic TT and maybe some other bits and pieces in between.
""I'm just glad to be here and plan to get out there, enjoy life and have as much fun as possible.""
Previously resident in Windsor, outside London, Anstey is now living in the village of Cullybackey in county Antrim after recently moving to Northern Ireland with Anny.
""We needed a change. It's a lot quieter than where I was outside London and we are looking forward to it.
""I was at the Cookstown 100 on Saturday and it was great to be back out and about as I haven't been out for a long time.
""I hadn't been at a bikes meeting since 2019 so it was good to meet some old friends. Everybody is so friendly and it was nice to have a chat with everyone. It had been such a long time with Covid and everything."""	/sport/northern-ireland/58544514

entertainment	The Crown: Netflix defends show after Sir John Major criticism	"Netflix has defended The Crown as a ""fictional dramatisation"" following criticism of its forthcoming series.
Sir John Major told The Mail on Sunday that a scene which apparently depicts a plot to oust the late Queen was ""a barrel-load of malicious nonsense"".
ude a conversation between the former prime minister and Prince Charles, as he was then, about the Queen abdicating.
Sir John's office told the newspaper there was never any such discussion.
""Sir John has not co-operated in any way with The Crown. Nor has he ever been approached by them to fact-check any script material in this or any other series,"" a statement from his office read.
""As you will know, discussions between the monarch and prime minister are entirely private and - for Sir John - will always remain so. But not one of the scenes you depict are accurate in any way whatsoever. They are fiction, pure and simple.""
However, a spokeswoman for The Crown defended the show, saying: ""The Crown has always been presented as a drama based on historical events.
""Series five is a fictional dramatisation, imagining what could have happened behind closed doors during a significant decade for the royal family - one that has already been scrutinised and well-documented by journalists, biographers and historians.""
will focus on the tumultuous early 1990s, which saw Prince Charles and Princess Diana separate.
Sir Malcom Rifkind, foreign secretary under Sir John, also criticised the popular drama, telling The Mail on Sunday that the scene featuring Sir John and Prince Charles was ""pathetic and absurd"", while broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby, a friend of the King, said: ""The Crown is full of nonsense, but this is nonsense on stilts.""
w series is released on Netflix on 9 November and is expected to show Prince Charles (played by Dominic West) cutting short a holiday with Diana, Princess of Wales to host a secret meeting with Sir John (Jonny Lee Miller), at his private residence, Highgrove, in 1991.
Imelda Staunton comes on board as the latest actress to play the late Queen, following in the footsteps of Claire Foy and Olivia Colman.
Some figures have defended The Crown's fictional interpretation of events.
According to The Times, Robert Harris, the historical fiction author and former journalist, said: ""I take a kind of heretical view in that I think The Crown has done the royal family nothing but good in some ways.""
Speaking at the Cliveden Literary Festival, he added: ""Nobody really takes it literally, do they? I'm not sure that they do.""
Prince Harry has also said it gave a rough idea of what living as a Royal was like.
He told James Corden in an interview last year: ""They [The Crown] don't pretend to be news. It's fictional. But it's loosely based on the truth. Of course, it's not strictly accurate, of course not, but loosely it gives you a rough idea about what that lifestyle, the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything else, what can come from that.""
Netflix has previously stated that it will not warn viewers of The Crown that some scenes are fictional.
Responding to calls for a warning from the then Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden in 2020, the streaming giant said the series has always been billed as a drama.
""As a result we have no plans, and see no need, to add a disclaimer,"" it said.
However, a tagline on the Netflix show's home page reads: ""Based on historical events, this series dramatises the story of Queen Elizabeth II and the political and personal events that have shaped her reign.""
Mr Dowden said younger viewers ""may mistake fiction for fact"" when watching the fourth series, which showed the breakdown of the marriage between the then Prince and Princess of Wales.
Filming on the sixth series of The Crown was briefly suspended as a mark of respect after the Queen's death. It was also halted on the day of her funeral.
But there was consternation from some quarters about the fifth series being released two months after Her Majesty's death.
Loose Women presenter Brenda Edwards were among the figures suggesting it should have been delayed as a mark of respect."	/news/entertainment-arts-63283024
business	Cost of living creates upheaval in Christmas toy shopping habits	"Children's pester power is losing some of its impact in the run-up to Christmas owing to the soaring cost of living, an expert has said.
Melissa Symonds, UK director of toy analysts NPD, said parents were changing their shopping habits, ruling out some low-cost impulse purchases.
She said the ""sweet spot"" for retailers was toys priced from £20 to £50 that would last beyond the festive season.
Forecasts suggest toy sales are unlikely to rise this year.
ue of sales in the UK toys market in the first nine months of the year is down 5% compared with the same period last year, NPD analysis suggests.
""Parents are being stronger with pester power and saying 'no' at low price points, but they are not over-indulging at the highest prices either,"" Ms Symonds said.
She said that families were moving to the ""middle-ground"", even though £100 is typically spent on toys for children aged up to 10 at Christmas. 
Despite the predictions of stagnant or falling sales, retailers will be hopeful that the timing of Christmas Day boosts sales. It falls on a Sunday, giving them a full shopping week in advance - which was a bumper week the last time it happened in 2016.
UK toy industry is still the second largest in Europe and the fifth biggest in the world. 
As it unveiled its top 12 ""dream toys"" for Christmas, the Toy Retailers Association said it was conscious of the financial pressure facing families. However, people did still tend to prioritise spending on children for birthdays and Christmas, so toys at a range of prices were chosen.
""Kids are lucky enough to be put first,"" said Aimee Hill, a toy selector representing the association. ""Half of the list of 12 is below £30 which is quite reasonable.
""People want fun this year more than ever because they are facing some real challenges.""
rage price of the dozen highlighted toys - which include a fluffy guinea pig that gives birth to three pups - is just under £35. That is only £1 lower than the average last year, but nearly £10 cheaper than two years ago.
Across the market, the average cost of a toy is less than £10 during the year, and £13 at Christmas.
Ms Hill said that higher costs were not being passed on by the toy industry in the same way they had for groceries - a point reflected in official inflation figures. 
Among those fearing the financial pressure of the festive season is Kerry, who is unable to work while awaiting surgery.
""My Christmas Day will be filled with guilt,"" the 47-year-old told the BBC. ""I am absolutely dreading it.""
""I am looking out for the cheap options for everything. I can't afford to get my youngest daughter a main present, so it will be bits I can scrape together.
""I never spoilt her, but it would be nice not to have to worry about things so much.""
She said she was suggesting to relatives that they buy her daughter toiletries and practical items as presents.
""It is upsetting. You would want to get her a treat, not just something we use everyday,"" she said.
Barnardo's, the children's charity, said its survey work suggested about half of parents with children aged under 18 were expecting to spend less on presents and food and drink compared with previous years.
financial company, Barclaycard forecast a ""restrained approach to festivities"" among consumers this year. This would include more buying of secondhand gifts and families setting spending limits to manage their costs, it said."	/news/business-63559412
technology	Musk says Twitter feud with Apple boss 'resolved'	"Elon Musk has said he and Apple boss Tim Cook have ""resolved the misunderstanding"" over Twitter possibly being removed from the app store.
On Monday, Mr Musk accused Apple of threatening to cut the platform from its app store and said it had halted most of its advertising on the site.
But the Twitter boss tweeted on Wednesday that: ""Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so.""
He did not say if Apple's advertising was discussed at the meeting.
meeting between the two tech leaders comes as many companies have halted spending on Twitter amid concerns about Mr Musk's content moderation plans for the site - a major blow to the company, which relies on such spending for most of its revenue. 
Entering a feud on Monday, Mr Musk accused Apple of ""censorship"" and criticised its policies, including the charge it levies on purchases made on its app store.
""Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. Do they hate free speech in America?"" he said.
But he later told his followers he was meeting with Mr Cook at Apple's headquarters, adding: ""Good conversation. Among other things, we resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store. Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so.""
News of the meeting with Apple came after Mr Musk was told he faced ""huge work ahead"" to bring Twitter into compliance with new European Union rules on disinformation or face a possible ban.
EU commissioner Thierry Breton made the comments in a meeting with Mr Musk on Wednesday, saying the social media site would have to address issues such as content moderation, disinformation and targeted adverts.
Approved by the EU earlier this year, the Digital Services Act is seen as the biggest overhaul of rules governing online activity in decades, imposing new obligations on companies to prevent abuse of their platforms. 
Major companies are expected to be in compliance with the law some time next year.
If firms are found to be violation, they face fines of up to 6% of global turnover - or a ban in the case of repeated serious breaches.
In a statement after the meeting, Mr Breton said he welcomed Mr Musk's assurances that he would get Twitter ready to comply. 
""Let's also be clear that there is still huge work ahead, as Twitter will have to implement transparent user policies, significantly reinforce content moderation and protect freedom of speech, tackle disinformation with resolve, and limit targeted advertising,"" he said. 
""All of this requires sufficient AI [Artificial Intelligence] and human resources, both in volumes and skills. I look forward to progress in all these areas and we will come to assess Twitter's readiness on site.""
EU plans to conduct a ""stress test"" in 2023 ahead of a wider audit, his office said. 
Since his $44bn takeover of Twitter last month, Mr Musk has fired thousands of staff, reinstated formerly banned users such as Donald Trump and stopped enforcing other policies, such as rules aimed at stopping misleading information on coronavirus.
moves have alarmed some civil rights groups, who have accused the billionaire of taking steps that will increase hate speech, misinformation and abuse.
In a blog post on Wednesday, Twitter said none of its policies had changed, but that it was experimenting in an effort to improve the platform more quickly and would rely more on steps to limit the spread of material that violate its rules - offering ""freedom of speech but not freedom of reach"".
""Our trust & safety team continues its diligent work to keep the platform safe from hateful conduct, abusive behavior, and any violation of Twitter's rules,"" the company added.
""The team remains strong and well-resourced, and automated detection plays an increasingly important role in eliminating abuse,"" it said. "	/news/business-63816110
entertainment	Leslie Phillips: Film star and part-time sofa salesman in Wales	"Leslie Phillips may have been better known for his ""Ding Dong!"" catchphrase and playing lecherous bounders, but he also had a more unlikely career in furniture sales. 
ran actor, who has died at 98, was most familiar for his work in the Carry On and Harry Potter films.
But he also helped to found a family-run furniture store in south Wales.
""He would ring and you'd answer the phone and you'd have from him that famous 'hello',"" said Rhian Francis.
She runs The Place for Homes in Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, and said the actor was involved with the business for more than 50 years.
He even gave a speech at her wedding which, naturally, began with that ""hello...""
She said: ""He was a lovely man, very much the English gentleman"".
medy Casanova was one of the original founders of the store in the 1970s alongside Ms Francis's father Graham Nelson, and was heavily involved in the business ever since. 
""We would have regular board meetings that he would attend, and any sort of long-term planning was made as a family, with Leslie, he was very much part of the team,"" Ms Francis told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.
Mr Nelson first met him when he joined a company of which the Bafta-nominated actor was director, and the relationship grew over the years. 
Eventually they entered business together, and Phillips came up with the name The Place For Homes.
Ms Francis said that over the decades he became a part of the family, and would ring almost every week to speak to her father.
""He would ring and you'd answer the phone and you'd have from him that famous 'hello', and it would be 'hello darling, how are you, may I speak to your daddy please'.
""So we were used to hearing that catchphrase on a regular basis.""
She said that many of the staff who worked in the store over the years have met him: ""He was always very gracious, he would stop and accept the autograph (requests)"".
""He was always very generous in the way he would speak to people and interact with them, so a lovely, lovely man.""
She said one of her fondest memories was when he and his wife, the late Angela Scoular, attended her wedding.
""He came around the top table, put his hand on my father's shoulder and my shoulder and actually spoke.
""He started the speech with the famous 'hello' which set the tone for the whole speech. That's probably one of the fondest memories I have of him."""	/news/uk-wales-63566557
politics	Rishi Sunak is now going to COP27 climate summit	"rime minister has reversed an earlier decision not to go to the COP27 climate summit in Egypt.  
No 10 had said Rishi Sunak was too busy preparing for the 17 November budget to attend the event which opens on Sunday. 
But this had been widely criticised by climate campaigners, opposition parties and climate adviser Alok Sharma.   
Mr Sunak said there was ""no long-term prosperity without action on climate change"" or energy security without investment in renewables. 
""That's why I will attend COP27 next week - to deliver on Glasgow's legacy of building a secure, clean and sustainable future,"" he told MPs during Prime Minister's Questions. 
On Tuesday, former prime minister Boris Johnson said he would attend COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh.
UK hosted last year's COP (Conference Of The Parties) in Glasgow and it was chaired by Mr Sharma.   
Green MP Caroline Lucas welcomed what she called a ""screeching U-turn"" after ""an embarrassing mis-step on the world stage"".
""Let this be a lesson to him - climate leadership matters,"" she said.  
Caroline Lucas said it was ""quite extraordinary"" that Rishi Sunak was considering not going to COP27.
""We've lost a huge amount of credibility by the prime minister dragging his feet on this,"" she added. 
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the prime minister of acting ""in the name of political management"" rather than the national interest. 
""Caving in to criticism is not leadership. Real leadership is seizing your seat at the table. For UK jobs. For clean energy. For our environment,"" he tweeted. 
Liberal Democrat climate change spokesperson Wera Hobhouse said: ""This whole debacle has shown the environment is simply not a priority for Rishi Sunak. He's only going after being embarrassed by Boris Johnson's attendance.""
Downing Street rejected that, saying the prime minister had ""always recognised the importance of this summit and indeed tackling climate change more generally"". 
He ""wanted to make sure we were making good progress on the government's domestic agenda and the autumn statement in particular,"" it said. 
After discussions with Chancellor Jeremy Hunt this week, Mr Sunak felt there was ""sufficient space to make this trip"", it added.  
His official spokesman said the prime minister was hoping to make progress on the commitment to halt deforestation by 2030, and to agree new partnerships on clean and renewable energy.
Mr Sharma, who had said he was ""disappointed"" Mr Sunak would not be attending, tweeted that he was ""delighted"" the prime minister would now be going. 
Many world leaders including US President Joe Biden and France's Emmanuel Macron are due to attend the UN event.
Mr Sunak's predecessor Liz Truss had been set to go and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will also be there. 
A number of countries had also criticised Mr Sunak's earlier decision not to go and questioned the UK's commitment to tackle the climate crisis.
Egyptian government, which is hosting COP27, voiced its ""disappointment"". Carlos Fuller, Belize's ambassador to the UN, told The Guardian it looked as if the UK was ""washing their hands of leadership"". 
Mohammed Nasheed, speaker of the Maldives parliament and a former president, said nothing was more serious than climate change.
Let's be clear, Rishi Sunak attending the UN climate conference in Egypt isn't likely to significantly change its outcome.   
ual negotiations are done by the army of diplomats and civil servants who are already flying into the Egyptian holiday resort where the talks will take place. 
But the signal that the UK prime minister acknowledges the importance of the conference - albeit belatedly - will be welcome. 
Leaders have an important role to play, UN chief Antonio Guterres told me when we spoke last week. 
He says they help ""galvanise"" the talks, creating the momentum for more ambitious agreements to be reached.   
Mr Sunak also has a prominent ceremonial role. The UK hosted the last UN climate summit in Glasgow. and he will formally hand over responsibility for the process to the Egyptian government. 
King Charles - a long-time champion of environmental causes - will still not be going, despite speaking at COP26 in Glasgow. 
No 10 said there was a ""unanimous agreement"" with Buckingham Palace that the King would not attend. 
ual climate summits are designed to help governments agree measures to limit rises in global temperatures.

business	Avanti West Coast boss quits after train timetable cuts	"managing director of Avanti West Coast is stepping down, the company has announced, amid a backlash over timetable cuts. 
rail firm said Phil Whittingham would leave on 15 September - the same day new train strikes will take place. 
Services between London and Manchester have been cut to a third, with the company blaming ""staffing issues"". 
Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said the firm should be in the ""last chance saloon"".
Mr Burnham has previously called for the company's licence to be revoked if services aren't restored - a decision only the government can take. 
""This is England's most important railway line, linking its biggest cities, and every day that this chaos continues is a day when our economy in Greater Manchester is damaged and another day of misery for passengers,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. 
Last month, Avanti West Coast cut its timetable from three services an hour to one - blaming staffing issues. 
Explaining the timetable change at the time, Mr Whittingham said the ""current industrial relations climate"" had resulted in ""severe staff shortages in some grades through increased sickness levels, as well as unofficial strike action by Aslef members"".
mpany said it currently had more drivers than before the pandemic but relied on staff working overtime in order to run a full timetable and keep up with training.
union said the company needed to employ more drivers - and denied any accusation of unofficial strike action.
In a statement, Avanti apologised to customers for the ""enormous frustration and inconvenience"" caused by the reduced timetable.
uts to the timetable have prompted widespread criticism and frustration.
Mr Burnham said Mr Whittingham's departure revealed a serious management failure, and urged the government to ""stop playing politics"" regarding the country's widespread strike action. 
He called on the UK's new prime minister, who will be announced on Monday, to ""reset"" the debate.
""We need to start fixing problems and working together, rather than this playing the politics and trying to demonise the trade unions."" 
A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""People deserve certainty and confidence that their train will run on time, and while the change of schedule was unavoidable, it should minimise the fallout for passengers. 
""This is a prime example of why we need to modernise our railways, so passengers benefit from reliable timetables that don't rely on the goodwill of drivers volunteering to work overtime in the first place.""
First Rail boss Steve Montgomery said: ""Having led the team through the challenges presented by the pandemic over the last two years and into the recovery period, Phil leaves with the team ready for the challenges in delivering the future service requirements.
""I would like to thank Phil and wish him well in the future.""
On Wednesday, Aslef said its members at 12 operators - including Avanti West Coast - would take industrial action on 15 September.
Separately, the RMT union has announced two more national rail strikes later this month. Workers will walk out on 15 and 17 September in a long-running dispute about pay, jobs and conditions. "	/news/business-62771922
politics	Ian Blackford to stand down as SNP leader at Westminster	"Ian Blackford is to stand down as leader of the SNP group at Westminster, it has been confirmed.
Mr Blackford said he believed it was time for ""fresh leadership"" after five years in the role.
He said he would formally stand down at the group's annual general meeting next week. 
re has been speculation in recent weeks that some SNP MPs were plotting to replace Mr Blackford as group leader.
Mr Blackford said he would continue in his role as the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber and had also accepted a new role at the centre of the SNP's independence campaign.
And he insisted he had not been pressured into resigning, telling BBC Scotland: ""No, not at all. I've taken the decision"". 
He added: ""The first minister has asked me to take on a role as her business ambassador. I'm absolutely delighted to have the opportunity to take on the engagement with the business community. 
""In order to do that, it's right that I stand down as the SNP Westminster leader. 
""I've done it for five and a half years so it's time for others to come forward and take the Westminster group through on the next part of its journey and helping the party towards independence."" 
Mr Blackford has become as well-known figure in the House of Commons through his weekly appearance at Prime Minister's Questions and is seen as being a close ally of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader. 
He faced calls to resign from political opponents after the Daily Mail reported in June that it had obtained a recording of Mr Blackford urging fellow MPs to give ""absolute full support"" to SNP MP Patrick Grady, who was suspended for sexual misconduct.
Mr Grady, a former SNP chief whip, was suspended from Parliament for two days over a sexual advance towards a colleague in 2016, and also suspended from the SNP's Westminster group for a week.
Ms Sturgeon subsequently said that the support expressed for Mr Grady had been ""unacceptable"". 
re have been reports that some SNP MPs were also unhappy at Mr Blackford's handling of the case, with Aberdeen South MP Stephen Flynn recently dismissing suggestions that he was ""on manoeuvres"" with a view to replacing him as group leader.
After announcing he was stepping down, Mr Blackford told BBC Scotland: ""I'll always speak up to make sure that we speak out against any kind of intimidation, any kind of bad behaviour, sexual exploitation. And in my new role I'll continue to do that when it's right to do so.""
At the time, Mr Blackford made clear that he intended to stand for re-election to the post at the upcoming AGM.
He also denied rumours in March that he was considering resigning amid further reports of party infighting.
SNP sources have told BBC Scotland that they expect Mr Flynn to stand for the leadership, and that he has ''broad support'' among their MPs and may be the only candidate to succeed Mr Blackford. 
Westminster group's AGM will be held next Tuesday, with the leader being selected by the 44 MPs who currently hold the SNP whip.
It means the new leader will be in place to face Rishi Sunak at Prime Minister's Questions the next day, 
Mr Blackford defeated former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy to become the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber in 2015, with his campaign being mired in controversy over online abuse aimed at Mr Kennedy and his long-running battle with alcoholism.
Brian Smith, who was convenor of the SNP's Skye and Lochalsh branch, later resigned after it was reported that he had called Mr Kennedy a ""drunken slob"" and ""quisling-in-chief"" in a series of more than 130 tweets. 
Mr Kennedy died of a major haemorrhage linked to his alcoholism just three weeks after the election.
It is only a fortnight since Ian Blackford made clear he would stand again for the leadership of the SNP group at Westminster at their annual meeting next week. 
At that point, his MP colleague Stephen Flynn insisted he did not intend to put his name forward, despite reports suggesting he was preparing to challenge for the job. 
Mr Flynn is now expected to stand and may be the only candidate. So what's changed?
It seems a majority of SNP MPs made clear they favoured a leadership change and that Mr Blackford decided to stand down, avoiding a potential challenge he might not win or being stuck leading a disgruntled group. 
re have been rumblings about his position for a while, not least since the controversy over his handling of a harassment complaint against the MP Patrick Grady. 
Others say his leadership has not been inclusive enough with high profile MP Joanna Cherry - who has criticised the leadership over women's rights and its independence strategy - sacked from the party's front bench team. 
Ms Sturgeon said Mr Blackford had led the party's Westminster group at a time of ""huge electoral success"".
She added: ""I would like to place on record my thanks for Ian's diligence, tenacity, friendship and loyalty in his time as group leader. 
""I look forward to working with Ian's successor as group leader at Westminster, as we continue to make the case for the people of Scotland to have a democratic choice on the country's future.""
SNP MP Joanna Cherry, who has been an outspoken critic of Ms Sturgeon's leadership, tweeted that she was ""pleased to hear"" that Mr Blackford was standing down as it was ""time for fresh leadership and tolerance of debate and diverse viewpoints.""
She added: ""I hope the SNP Westminster group will be now be left to choose our new leader without outside interference and in accordance with our standing orders.""
Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray said Mr Blackford's decision to stand down showed that the SNP was in ""total disarray"".
He added: ""Nationalist MPs know Nicola Sturgeon's plan for a de facto referendum is finished before it is even started and are worried about Labour gaining seats.""
Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said Mr Blackford should have been ""sacked immediately"" by Ms Sturgeon over his support for Mr Grady, and accused the first minister of showing a ""total lack of judgement"". 
He added: ""It is clear that, unlike Nicola Sturgeon, SNP MPs were not prepared to forgive how Ian Blackford put the needs of the perpetrator above the victim who had bravely come forward in this case. 
""The SNP Westminster group are clearly in a state of disarray and Nicola Sturgeon is rapidly losing her grip over her party."""	/news/uk-scotland-63821836
business	Amazon could pay UK shoppers £900m compensation	"Amazon shoppers in the UK could receive a share of £900m in compensation, once a legal claim is submitted against the technology giant. 
roposed claim alleges the company breached competition law and caused customers to pay higher prices.
It is being led by consumer-rights champion Julie Hunter, who says products sold on Amazon.co.uk and the Amazon app obscured better-value deals.
ue to be filed before the end of the month.
Started as an online bookseller, Amazon is now the biggest e-commerce company in the world.
More than 80% of purchases on the site are made via featured offers in the ""buy box"". 
But Ms Hunter alleges independent sellers are excluded from the buy box, even when they offer the same product cheaper or on better terms - thus breaching UK and EU competition law.
""Nine out of 10 shoppers in the UK have used Amazon, according to surveys, and two-thirds use it at least once a month,"" she said. 
Ms Hunter alleges Amazon uses ""tricks of design to manipulate consumer choice and direct customers towards the featured offer in its buy box"".
featured offer is the only one considered and selected by the vast majority of users, many of whom trust Amazon and wrongly assume it is the best deal, according to Ms Hunter.
gal action, to be filed in the Competition Appeal Tribunal, in London, will seek damages from Amazon estimated in the region of £900m.
David Greene, from the London Solicitors Litigation Association, told BBC News the likelihood of success was difficult to assess.
""Clearly Amazon will fight the case at all stages, including class certification, but the tribunal has made a number of orders recently for similar actions, certifying the optout process,"" he said.
""Big tech companies are well resourced to fight.""
Anyone living in the UK who has made purchases on Amazon.co.uk or the Amazon mobile app since October 2016 is an eligible member of the claimant class. 
roposed lawsuit is an optout collective-action claim, which means affected shoppers, on whose behalf the class action is brought, will not pay costs or fees to participate. 
Lesley Hannah, one of the partners at Hausfeld and Co LLP, who are leading the litigation, said: ""Competition laws are there to protect everyone. They ensure that individuals can make genuine and informed choices and are not simply led into making selections which benefit the companies they interact with.
""Fairness is at the heart of competition law - and consumers are not being treated fairly by Amazon."" 
Ms Hunter added: ""Amazon shouldn't be allowed to set the rules in its favour and treat consumers unfairly. That is why I am bringing this action."" 
An Amazon official said: ""This claim is without merit and we're confident that will become clear through the legal process. 
""Amazon has always focused on supporting the 85,000 businesses that sell their products on our UK store - and more than half of all physical product sales on our UK store are from independent selling partners. 
""We always work to feature offers that provide customers with low prices and fast delivery.""
European Commission is pursuing two formal anti-trust investigations into Amazon. 
One, from November 2020, is evaluating the same alleged ""self-preferencing"" by Amazon as is alleged in the UK claim. 
mmission's preliminary finding was the rules and criteria for the buy box unduly favoured Amazon's own retail business and marketplace sellers using its logistics and delivery services. 
It is currently evaluating commitments offered by Amazon to address these concerns.
In July 2022, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced it was investigating Amazon's business practices, including how it set the criteria for selecting of the featured offer. 
CMA indicated its investigation followed on from the European Commission's."	/news/technology-63328589
health	How play makes hospital less traumatic for children	"How play therapy helps children in hospital
Play is how children learn to navigate the world, create relationships, manage their emotions and cope with stressful situations.
re aren't many experiences more stressful than being ill and receiving treatment in hospital yet many do not offer much in the way of play, despite this being a government requirement.
Why is it so important?
Like many six-year-olds, Afonso is focused on building a toy track. Unlike many of his peers, he's trying to construct it in a hospital.  
When he was three, he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a treatable cancer which demands hospital visits for treatments such as chemotherapy as well as lots of blood tests.
""I remember the first period of treatment, which was horrendous,"" his mother, Susana Casanova, recalls.
When he was having his first cannula - a tube which administers treatments - inserted, Susana remembers holding him as he was telling her: ""Mummy, how do you allow them to hurt me so much?"" 
Now, a couple of years and many treatments later, he is not fazed.
""He is not traumatised by the word 'hospital', or doctors or nurses or procedures or lumbar punctures. He's not scared of that,"" Susana says. ""Last year in school, he made a show and tell of going in an ambulance.""
She believes the difference is down to play specialists, experts who entertain Afonso and play with him to support him through his treatments.
""The play is really amazing and it makes children forget they are in the hospital; the playmates put children in their natural environment,"" Susana says.
Julie Morris, one of Afonso's ""playmates"" at Kingston Hospital in south-west London, says it ""involves creating an environment for children that's not clinical"".  
""They (children) often ask for one of us to be with them when they have a scan or a blood test. It makes them feel a little bit more reassured, having somebody there. 
""Sometimes they even look forward to coming in to see us and play in the playroom as well, which is nice.
""We can distract them when they have procedures, we can explain about the procedures - we're with them the whole time."" 
For Afonso's mother, the specialists weren't just there for her son, but her as well.
""Twenty-four hours in hospital, it's too intense,"" she says.
""They've always been super-protective, providing the coffee when I needed, playing with him so I could have a shower to keep going.
""They come and help us in every way they can, making them feel happy and that's the main thing that we want, to see our son happy, and be taken care of.""
One mother, who recently spent more than 20 hours in A&E with her one-year-old, described it as a really tough experience as no play options were available.
""When children go into hospital, they're traumatised, they're afraid, they're anxious, and play is the natural choice for children to feel back in control,"" says Cathy Gilman, chief executive of Starlight Children's Foundation, a charity which provides toys to hospitals.
""It's so important a child isn't lonely or bored in hospital because that's a dangerous place where your mind and your imagination run riot.""
Play specialists can also help children process difficult emotions. 
Children tend to ""puddle jump"" with their feelings - one minute they can be very sad, the next singing and dancing - says play therapist Donna Ellis. 
rd for children, especially if they think their actions are affecting their parents.
""They're very influenced by the mood and the atmosphere around them,"" she says.
""If children start to think they can't talk about things or notice that it's upsetting adults, they can then learn they've got to adapt their own behaviours.
""As adults, we're quite guilty of persuading children out of feeling states. When they're upset, we'll say 'oh, cheer up, never mind' or 'it's OK'.
""Feelings come and go. If you talk with children about feelings being like waves, and the wave comes, it feels a bit bumpy or a bit scary or a bit rocky, but the seas move over.""
One of the benefits of having a play specialist or therapist on hand is that they do not have the same emotional investment in a child as the parents.
""Although I am emotionally connected to them, they're not my children, so we can have difficult conversations, children can say things to me,"" adds Ms Ellis.
It's a service not available to every child.
According to the National Association of Healthcare Specialists, 80% of hospitals say their play services are limited.
Many have not recovered the service they offered before the pandemic when play areas were closed for infection control and play specialists were redeployed. 
But even before the pandemic, access to play support was far from universal, according to Ms Gilman, who says 80% of hospitals that use Starlight's services have no budget for play and, of those that do, it's less than £500 a year. 
In 2004, the government's national framework for children, young people and maternity services set out a requirement for play services to be available in all hospital settings, citing research that showed play ""hastened recovery, as well as reduced the need for interventions to be delivered under general anaesthesia"".
In a statement, the NHS said it recognised the importance of children's play services and was working closely with the Starlight Children's Foundation on increasing their availability.
""We have introduced a new taskforce and will be creating guidance for local areas to help them increase access and improve the quality of these services across hospitals in England, in line with NICE guidance,"" it added.
One service Starlight offers is boxes containing toys and other things for children to play with. Each one costs about £100 and can support 60 children. 
rity is also running a Christmas appeal, called Play Loneliness Away, to raise £400,000 to make sure children have access to toys and technology such as computer consoles.
Although NHS budgets are stretched, play can help make treatments go more smoothly which helps nurses and saves money in the long run, Ms Gilman says.
""If a child is less distressed then they can be treated more easily. So that preparation before with play, distraction during treatment and when you're bored afterwards is really important.""
Claire Russell, early years expert and founder of PlayHOORAY!
Play can offer an amazing insight into how your child thinks and feels. When a child is processing complex emotional issues, it can very often show up in their play. 
For example, if a child hears adults arguing, they may recreate this conflict with their teddies. 
Make-believe play can help prepare children for the unknown and ease worry and anxiety in the process.
As children get older their play changes so then it is about finding new ways to ""play"". 
Dancing or singing loudly can be seen as play too. Research shows these activities will get the endorphins going, which can actually reduce stress levels and be a factor in warding off anxiety and depression. 
It's important that people know that they don't need to spend money on toys or equipment to entertain a child - I promise you can have just as much fun with everyday items around the house. 
Spending time with your child and being silly with them, whatever their age, will remind them they are valued and loved, and laughing together is a wonderful medicine.

technology	Russia hits Google with fine for 'illegal content'	"Russia has hit Google with a 21.1bn rouble ($373m; £301m) fine for failing to restrict access to ""prohibited"" material about the war in Ukraine and other content.
Roskomnadzor, the country's communications regulator, said the information included ""fake"" reports that discredited Russia's military and posts urging people to protest.
It called the US tech giant a ""systematic"" violator of its laws.
Google did not comment immediately.
mpany's local subsidiary declared bankruptcy last month. The move came after Russian authorities seized its local bank account, allowing them to recover 7.2bn roubles that the firm had been ordered to pay for similar reasons last year.
In recent years, Russia has been ramping up pressure on tech firms, accusing them of not moderating their content properly, and interfering in the country's internal affairs.
fforts to control social media and other news sites have escalated following the invasion of Ukraine in February. The government also passed a law threatening people who spread ""fake"" information about the war with 15 years in prison.
In March, Google, owned by Alphabet, stopped offering its commercial services in Russia, such as advertising. It has also stepped up its restrictions for news accounts backed by Russia and relocated staff.
However, unlike some other social media sites, such as Facebook, it has not been completely banned in Russia, where many smart phones rely on the company's technology.
In March, Alphabet said the decision to continue offering search, maps and YouTube provided Russians with access to ""global information and perspectives"".
fine announced on Monday, which was calculated as a share of the firm's local revenue, marks the biggest penalty ever imposed on a tech company in Russia, according to state media."	/news/business-62214564
politics	EU funds: 'Bleak time until money is fully replaced'	"UK may have officially left the European Union in 2020 but Brexit is still making headlines.
And for some community organisations in Northern Ireland, it has left them in funding limbo.
European Social Fund, which is aimed at helping people who have difficulties finding work, will no longer be available to the UK from March 2023.
While the UK government has promised to fill the void left by the removal of EU structural funds through the UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF) by 2024, there is still a great deal of uncertainty.
Some groups are concerned they will no longer qualify for the funding, while others are not sure the money will be enough.
One of the groups reliant on ESF money is Larne-based Access Employment Limited (AEL), which provides opportunities for people with disabilities to gain work experience and training.
It runs a number of social enterprises - businesses whose primary purpose is to address need rather than create profit. 
One of them involves repackaging goods from around the world and selling them online. There's also a cafe and a garden centre for trainees to learn new skills.

She said they were looking at a £200,000 deficit without the funding in place and this would mean they could help fewer people and staff would lose their jobs.
ke on 175 trainees in the last seven years, since the ESF funding has been in place.
Ms Black says they offer five hours a day, five days a week and the service is a lifeline for families.
""It impacts their families, who rely on AEL as a form of respite,"" she said.
""There is not enough capacity within existing statutory services to replace the loss of current ESF programmes, and this means individuals are being denied access to support services that enable them to make informed choices about their day-to-day lives and help them reach their full potential within their communities.""
Daniel Johnston, who is on one of AEL's programmes, said he had gained new skills and new friends.
""If I wasn't coming here, I would remain unemployed,"" he said. ""I wouldn't be able to get work without the support AEL.""
Julie Steele is operations director of the Advantage Foundation, which runs a project called Quest. 
It provides training to young offenders, who complete a qualification in employability and gain work experience in the foundation's social enterprise Mugshots, a print shop which puts designs on T-shirts and other merchandise.
She said Quest, which aims to reduce reoffending rates, was 65% ESF-funded and 35% Department of Justice-funded.
""The loss of ESF funding and the need to replace it with, as a minimum, the same level of resourcing, is a critical issue,"" she said.
""ESF-funded projects work hard to ensure they have positive outcomes not only for the service users but also for the wider community.""
Northern Ireland's politicians and a consortium of community groups have been  urging the government to fully replace the lost funding.
ESF had previously provided about £40m a year, which was 35% match-funded from Stormont, giving £54m in total.
Next year experts are anticipating about £30m from the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, but no match funding has been confirmed from Stormont yet.
Stormont's Finance Minister Conor Murphy said it had been a straightforward arrangement when the departments were operating the ESF themselves, directing support to groups who need it and match funding it.
""That arrangement doesn't exist any more, so it has left us in a huge degree of limbo,"" he told the BBC.
Economy Minister Gordon Lyons told the BBC the funding issue was not an inevitable consequence of Brexit but a case of the UK government not keeping its word.
""It's OK to admit when you have got it wrong,"" he said. ""The government needs to recognise they have not fulfilled their promises and they need to change course.""
ESF Peer Group, an umbrella body for a number of groups, said it had been working for more than a year with officials from Westminster and Stormont departments to find an adequate funding package to replace the ESF.
""Unless we find a solution, the 22 community groups we represent will be unable to continue supporting some 18,000 of the most vulnerable in our society or provide security of employment for their 1,700 staff,"" it said.
group added it had a positive meeting with officials from the Department for Levelling Up and the Northern Ireland Civil Service on 14 October.
""The issues which remain to be addressed are around compliance with equality legislation and how the limited Shared Prosperity Funding might be added to from Northern Ireland budgets,"" it continued.
A government spokesperson said: ""Northern Ireland is benefiting from £49m through the first round of our Levelling Up Fund, and the fund's second round will provide further investment to help empower communities to drive change. 
""This is on top of £127m allocation from the UK Shared Prosperity Fund, that will help those most vulnerable and furthest away from the labour market to secure sustainable employment, alongside other priorities.
""Over the summer, officials have engaged widely with partners to seek views on priorities for UKSPF in Northern Ireland and develop an investment plan. 
""This work will conclude shortly and will then move to the implementation phase, including funding opportunities for delivery in 2023-24."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63240806

sports	Melika Balali: I got threats from Iran for wrestling in Scotland	"'When I received threats I knew my way was right'
An Iranian wrestler who won gold for Scotland has been given police security after allegedly receiving threats from her government.
Melika Balali protested against the forced wearing of the hijab on the winner's platform of a the British Wrestling Championships in June.
22-year-old said her family has since cut contact with her.
It came two months before the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody, which has sparked protest across Iran.
Officers reportedly beat Ms Amini, 22, after she wore the hijab ""improperly"" - though police deny this and say she suffered a heart attack.
After moving to Scotland last November, Ms Balali joined the Scottish Wrestling Association - for whom she won gold in the senior female competition at the British championships in Manchester.
During the medal ceremony, she held up a sign that read ""stop forcing hijab, I have the right to be a wrestler"".
Many women and girls in Iran have been removing the mandatory scarf in demonstrations engulfing the country.
Authorities have tried to suppress them by force, while Ayatollah Khamenei has accused the US and Israel of orchestrating ""riots"" - a claim dismissed by critics.
Meanwhile Ms Balali told BBC Scotland's The Nine that since she has started speaking out about women's rights, she has been sent threats from the Iranian government on social media.
She said: ""They've tried to find where I'm living and who I'm practising with. But thanks to police in Scotland... I live safely, I train in a safe area - I have all kinds of security.
""The first time I wore a singlet in Manchester, my family stopped talking to me. They think they are ashamed of me. 
""But I'm happy because I decided to be this kind of person. These threats make me stronger. When I receive threats from the government of Iran I just think my way is right - if I were wrong, why would they threaten me?""
Police Scotland said it was made aware of online threats having been made in July, adding: ""Enquiries were carried out and a safety plan is in place.""
Born in Shahrekord, in Iran's Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province, Ms Balali said her parents made her wear the hijab from the age of five.
She also said she was not allowed to pursue wrestling because she was a woman, despite it being a tradition among the men in her family.
ged in 2018 when the Iranian Wrestling Federation created a women's team - though Ms Balali had to compete in a body suit which covered her hair, as well as shorts and a T-shirt.
Pursuing the sport more freely, she says, was the main reason she left home.
""It's not just the dress code,"" she said. ""You see the dress covering the face, the head scarf, but it's not just the clothes. You mentally cover your mind.
""But when I'm here and wearing a singlet I feel free.
""Not because I'm free to do wrestling, because I'm not wearing three layers of clothes - but because I'm free to think, free to build something that is for me.""
Now living in Edinburgh, Ms Balali is torn between two worlds.
Although she admits being threatened was ""terrifying"", she feels she can speak out about injustices from a place of relative safety in Scotland.
Watching her fellow countrywomen face violence on Iran's streets has been painful, but also makes her proud - particularly when she sees younger women on the front line of protests.
In solidarity, Ms Balali recently shaved her head at a protest in Glasgow's George Square.
As for the future, the 22-year-old said her sport has given her an important platform.
She is training at least twice a day and hopes to eventually compete internationally for Team GB.
But the growing sound of female unrest in Iran has also inspired her to continue speaking out.
""Their strength increases my energy, my potential to go for my next gold medal,"" she said. 
""It's not only about the gold, it's about what I'm talking about. I'm using that platform to talk - if that platform is big my voice will be louder. The strength comes from my homeland. 
""I lived in Iran for 18 years, but I didn't have any life. I didn't feel anything. When I abandoned Iran I came to Scotland and started thinking here - with this thinking I'm alive."" "	/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-63572748

health	Mould at home: How dangerous is it and what can be done?	"Exposure to mould in the home can be damaging to your health. 
An inquest found that two-year-old Awaab Ishak died as a result of a severe respiratory condition caused by prolonged exposure to mould in his home in Rochdale. 
But what exactly is mould, when is it harmful, and what can be done about it in your house?
Mould is a microscopic fungus that grows in damp places. Mould spores are found everywhere, and are released in their thousands into the atmosphere. 
Signs of mould at home include fuzzy black, white or green patches on the walls, and a damp and musty smell. 
Mould and damp in houses is more dangerous when temperatures drop in the winter.
People living with mould are more likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses, infections, allergies or asthma.
Mould can emit spores, cells, fragments and ""volatile organic compounds"" into the air.
Inhaling or touching these spores can cause an allergic reaction, such as sneezing, a runny nose, red eyes and skin rash.
Moulds can also trigger asthma attacks and cause coughing, wheezing and breathlessness.
""[Even] people who don't have asthma can develop an allergic response,"" according to Dr Andy Whittamore, a GP who works with the charity Asthma and Lung UK.
""In some cases, mould can be breathed in and can be found growing in the lungs - it can be life-threatening.""
more at risk include the elderly, children and babies, people with existing respiratory illnesses and people with some skin problems. 
Mould can also be more dangerous for people with a weakened immune system, either due to illness or because of medicines they are taking.
Condensation is the leading cause of mould in homes across the UK. 
It most commonly occurs in parts of the home where there are high moisture levels - in bathrooms, kitchens, and around windows. 
When the temperature falls to a level known as the dew point, water vapour in the air forms into water droplets.
If water vapour comes into contact with a surface in the home that's below the dew point, such as an uninsulated external wall or a cold window, then water droplets will form. 
If left untreated, the surface can become damp and create the conditions for mould to grow.
Catherine Noakes, professor of Environment Engineering for Buildings at the University of Leeds, said older and poorly insulated properties are more prone to this. 
Mould can also be caused by daily tasks which create excess moisture.
""Sometimes it's occupant behaviour - things that we all do and we cannot change,"" Prof Noakes said. 
""We all shower, we all cook, and we all dry washing at home.""
Prof Noakes warned that mould conditions could be made worse this winter if people don't put on the heating because of high energy bills. 
In severe cases, Prof Noakes said there are limits to what occupants can do.
However, in less serious cases, there are things that can help, from taking shorter showers to improving ventilation in the property.
""The shorter the shower, the less moisture there is,"" Prof Noakes said. 
She also suggests wiping down the shower afterwards, rather than leaving the water to evaporate.
Open kitchen windows or use an extractor fan when cooking.
It is also important to check for obvious problems such as leaky pipes or gutters which could be contributing to the problem.
Private and social landlords have a responsibility to make sure homes are fit for habitation.
If you are living in a rented property, it is the landlord's responsibility to fix a mould problem if it is caused by poor maintenance, according to the housing charity Shelter.
""Where the mould is caused by disrepair or the property is unfit for habitation - for example, as a result of damp or condensation caused by poor insulation or faulty heating or ventilation systems - then it is the landlord's responsibility to fix it,"" said John Gallagher, from the charity.
If the mould is so bad that it makes your home unfit for habitation, then you could be classed as homeless and entitled to emergency accommodation, he added.
But Mr Gallagher said if there is evidence a tenant is not ventilating the home correctly, then the landlord may not be responsible."	/news/uk-63642856

Arizona Cardinals defensive end, 33, was voted NFL defensive player of the year three times.
Watt spent a decade with the Houston Texans before joining Arizona in 2021.
""My heart is filled with nothing but love and gratitude. It's been an absolute honor and a pleasure,"" Watt wrote on Twitter.external-link
Watt has spent the last two seasons with the Cardinals, after representing the Houston Texans between 2011 and 2020.
He added that Sunday's defeat by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers was both his baby son Koa's first NFL game, and his own ""last ever"" home game.
Having failed to make the postseason, the Cardinals have two regular season games left, at Atlanta and San Francisco.
As well as being defensive player of the year in 2012, 2014 and 2015, Watt was the NFL's Walter Payton Man of the Year in 2017.

business	Millions start getting £326 cost-of-living payment	"Direct payments to help with the soaring cost of living are starting to be paid by the government into eight million people's accounts.
Low-income households on means-tested benefits will receive the money automatically in their bank, building society or credit union account.
first £326 payment will be paid by the end of July, marked as ""DWP Cost of Living"", the government has said.
A second instalment of £324 will be transferred in the autumn.
gether, they are the largest in a package of payments from the government designed to help with rising prices, and specifically soaring energy bills. Even so, recipients can spend or save the money as they see fit. 
A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We are on track to process the first instalment by the end of July.
""All eligible households will automatically receive the first instalment, and no one needs to worry they will miss out.
""There will be a few unique cases - such as those who were not initially entitled but have gained entitlement upon appeal - who will be paid after July, as soon as possible.""
Financial commentators say these payments will ease, but not cure, the financial strain families face this winter.
""It is a vital step in the right direction for those on lower incomes, but it is a small step back from the precipice after millions of people have edged ever-closer over the past few months,"" said Sarah Coles, senior personal finance analyst at financial services company Hargreaves Lansdown.
""It is a positive step for those on the lowest earnings, who have been hit three times harder than higher earners by rising prices. However, it is not enough to put people back where they were before price hikes.""
rgy bill of every household will be discounted by £400 from October, and there will be extra payments to pensioners and people with disabilities.
However, the prospect of a typical household's winter energy bill increasing by more than previously anticipated has also raised questions over whether more financial support will be needed soon.
One industry analyst has predicted a rise of more than £1,200 a year in October. Cornwall Insight said that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay £3,244 a year from October, then £3,363 a year from January.
resent is about £2,000 a year, which follows a £700 a year rise in April.
using prepayment meters have to pay slightly higher bills, and Citizens Advice has warned that the number of people seeking help because they cannot afford to top them up has reached a new record.
rity said that, in June, it dealt with over 1,319 cases on its helplines of people on prepayment meters going without power, known as self-disconnection. There were no signs of the normal drop-off in cases during the summer months.
umber of callers who were disconnecting from their energy supply and seeking help was already higher this year than for the whole of 2020 and 2021 combined, the charity said.
Data seen by the BBC shows that Citizens Advice referred almost 700 people a day to food banks in June, almost 300 a day more than the same period last year. Between January and June this year, the charity has helped almost 120,000 people with ""crisis support"" - 52% higher than the same period last year, and 182% higher than in 2019.
Cifas, the fraud prevention organisation, has also warned that the rising cost of living and energy bills were providing criminals with new opportunities to steal victim's personal and financial information.
It said it was seeing a rise in phishing emails claiming to be from utility companies offering savings on energy bills, as well as offering fuel vouchers, fake jobs and money-making opportunities. These emails were becoming increasingly sophisticated, as were the websites which were used to collect people's personal information.
Mike Haley, chief executive of Cifas, said: ""Everyone is at risk of being targeted by fraudsters, but the current economic crisis is making consumers even more vulnerable."""	/news/business-62148490

Jerome Powell warned that the Federal Reserve's policies will cause ""some pain to households and businesses"".
Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive for individuals and companies, which could slow economic growth as well as inflation.
Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed 2.7% lower on Monday in Tokyo.

He said that, while the hikes would come at a cost to American households and businesses, ""a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain"".
Inflation in the world's largest economy by gross domestic product (GDP) is at a four-decade high.

Owain has taken over from Vanessa Feltz, who stepped down in July 2022, and he said: ""I can't wait to help kick start the day on early breakfast live from Cardiff"".
move forms part of the BBC's Across The UK plans, which the corporation said would allow it to ""better reflect, represent and serve all parts of the country"".
rogramme will be broadcast Monday to Friday, from 04:00 BST to 06:30.
Owain said: ""When I asked my parents for a pair of turntables and mixing desk from a DJ shop in Llanelli when I was 13, I never allowed myself to dream that one day I'd have my own show on Radio 2.""
He started working as a television and radio presenter when he was 18, beginning as a children's news presenter at BBC Wales, before moving to become a weather presenter across the UK.
A keen drummer since he was seven, he shot to international fame when, during lockdown in 2020, he produced a video of himself drumming to the BBC News theme tune, which was viewed tens of millions of times around the globe.

sports	All-Ireland Club Hurling semi-final: Dunloy have 'confidence' for huge St Thomas' task	"Dunloy joint-captain Paul Shiels says the side have ""confidence in our ranks"" for Sunday's All-Ireland Club Hurling semi-final at Croke Park against Galway champions St Thomas'.
After winning a fifth successive Galway title, St Thomas' will go in as strong favourites at headquarters.
""We're well aware that coming from the north, we're not expected to go down and win,"" Shiels told BBC Sport NI.
""But when we started with this group, the aim was to get to Croke Park.""
, Dunloy were going to have to get past Slaughtneil in Ulster and at the fourth time of asking two weeks ago, after three defeats in the previous five years, the Cuchullainns finally managed to beat Michael McShane's side by earning a 2-12 to 0-16 victory in the provincial decider in Armagh.
Amid joyous scenes from the Dunloy faithful after the final whistle at the Athletic Grounds, former Antrim player Shiels spoke passionately of how ""Slaughtneil have lived in our heads for the last five years"".
But while Shiels continues to have the height of admiration for a Slaughtneil side who had  ""sent us back to the drawing board on every aspect of our game"", the task in hand is now St Thomas', a club that landed the All-Ireland title in 2013 and reached the final as recently as three years ago.
St Thomas' clinched their fifth straight Galway title by beating Loughrea by a single point in the replayed final. 
As has been the case over the last decade and more, the St Thomas' outfit is backboned by the Burke hurling brothers, with 2013 All-Ireland winner Kenneth now managing the side and Galway stars Eanna and David among the starting line-up along with other siblings Cathal and Darragh, and cousin Fintan also operating at full-back for good measure.
Not surprisingly amid their domination of club hurling in the county, the team is replete with further Galway stars including Conor Cooney so Shiels says Dunloy are fully mindful of the magnitude of the task that they face on Sunday.
""They are serial Galway winners so it's going to be a massive ask for us.
""But we just want to go down there and express our game and play to what we think are our strengths and we think Croke Park is as good a place as any to showcase that.
""We train hard. We do what we're supposed and we're just want to get down there and play. 
""And boys [such as Conor Cunning and Keelan Molloy] have been playing county hurling and have been exposed to Division One and played Cork in the senior championship this year. That's just the level they are at and hopefully they can bring that on Sunday.""
Dunloy's lost appearance at the All-Ireland stage in the Spring of 2010 saw them lose a semi-final against Galway opposition in the shape of Portumna.
However, six years earlier Dunloy defeated Portumna in an All-Ireland semi-final while they also beat another Galway side Athenry at the last-four stage when reaching their first national decider in 1995.
Dunloy's 2004 semi-final win set up a second successive All-Ireland Final appearance which was the club's last Croke Park game as they slipped to a very disappointing 0-17 to 1-6 defeat against Cork side Newtownshandrum.
reverse was the Cuchullains' fourth final defeat in nine years which included two losses against Birr (1995 after a replay and 2003) and the 1996 decider against Sixmilebridge.
Dunloy manager Gregory O'Kane played in all four All-Ireland Finals and now is attempting to guide his players to another decider where they would have the chance to achieve something that he and his team-mates couldn't quite do."	/sport/gaelic-games/63994556
business	Buy now, pay later: Warning over use of credit cards to cover payments	"Young shoppers risk building up debts by borrowing money to make buy now pay later repayments, Citizens Advice says.
Half of 18 to 34-year-olds used different types of credit - such as credit cards or borrowing from family - to make the payments, it said.
Although the results were drawn from a survey, the charity said the answers highlighted the issue of people relying on one debt to cover another.
Changes are being made that make some of these debts clearer to lenders.
Buy now pay later has become a commonplace method of payment and credit for UK shoppers in recent years. It allows people to pay for purchases in instalments over a short-term fixed-payment schedule, and interest-free.
Some 17 million people in the UK, including 30% of those aged in their 20s, have used it. While popular, it has led to concerns over levels and visibility of debt - particularly as budgets are squeezed by the rising cost of living.
Citizens Advice surveyed 2,288 people who had used buy now pay later during the past 12 months.
It found that most (52%) made repayments from their current account, but 23% used a credit card, 9% used a bank overdraft, and 7% borrowed from friends and family.
Millie Harris, a debt adviser at Citizens Advice in East Devon, said: ""Most of the people I speak to who are using buy now pay later live off overdrafts and credit cards, so are using these for repayments. It is just relying on one debt to pay off another debt. 
""What scares me most is how easily people can slip into using it. They come to rely on it much more quickly than other forms of credit. It's just a few clicks at a checkout. Too often that means people don't realise how serious it is - that it is credit and there are consequences if they don't repay it.""
One in 10 people in the survey said they did not fully understand how repayments would be set up.
Chloe Porter, from Birmingham, used to use buy now pay later and admitted she was uneducated about credit.
""When I moved out [from her parents' home], I was struggling to keep the repayments up and I ended up having to use credit cards to make the repayments. I just dug myself a hole,"" she said.
Since the start of June, banks and credit companies have been able to see whether shoppers use services from Klarna - the biggest buy now pay later company in the UK.
firm said this could help or hinder its customers' ability to get credit for loans such as mortgages, but did offer more clarity to potential lenders.
Buy now pay later firms have been under pressure from watchdogs over contract terms and conditions and they information they give to credit agencies. Stricter regulation is expected soon.
ggest operators in the UK are Klarna, Laybuy and Clearpay.

technology	TikTok to teach influencers about US mid-term election rules	"kTok is taking extra measures to limit misinformation and violations of its policies ahead of the US mid-term elections.
form has announced new steps to ensure influencers understand that paid political ads are prohibited.
Following 2020 US election the company admitted it needed to do more to ensure influencers followed its rules.
November's elections will see many governor, Senate and congressional contests.
Over the coming weeks TikTok said it would publish educational content and host briefings with influencers and advertising agencies ""so the rules of the road are abundantly clear when it comes to paid content around elections"". 
It warned that if it discovered that political content was paid for and not properly disclosed, it would be ""promptly removed from the platform"".
kTok says it has a longstanding policy to not allow paid political advertising, 
Ellen Judson, head of the Centre for the Analysis of Social Media at the think-tank Demos said: ""It's good to see that TikTok is acknowledging improvements can be made.""
But, she said, ""relying on educating influencers better about their rules is a poor substitute for systematically and proactively improving enforcement"" and warned that ""political actors will spot and exploit that gap"".  
However, TikTok's actions go beyond paid content. All posts, whether paid for or not, must also not violate its policies.
Election misinformation, harassment - including that directed towards election workers - hateful behaviour, and violent extremism are all banned, TikTok says.
Content may also be fact-checked and the company is taking steps to limit the spread of posts while that process is under way.
By Marianna Spring, disinformation and social media correspondent
kTok is the latest social media site to announce its plans to tackle false information and political advertising ahead of the US mid-terms. 
Memories of the riot on Capitol Hill after the last election are still raw - and that means even more of a push to tackle false and harmful content on social media before any US voter heads to the polls. 
Labels directing users to accurate information about voting were applied online during the 2020 election - but many critics would argue they did little to stop the most harmful and evidence-free claims about rigged elections and burnt ballots spreading. 
For TikTok, a lot of the focus is also on influencers being paid by political groups to promote their campaigns. That's prohibited by the app, but TikTok stars have often found ways of getting around this, with opportunities and events offered to them by groups rather than money.
And at the moment, these are just commitments. It remains to be seen how effective policies will be. 
It's only by entering the subjective social media world that US voters inhabit - especially on TikTok with its famously mysterious algorithm - that we can start to investigate how voters are being targeted and whether they're being misled. 
kTok also announced it will launch its election centre six weeks earlier than in 2020.
re aims to provide voters with authoritative information and other resources.
In announcing the new measures, Eric Han of TikTok said it was constantly seeking to improve the ""safety and integrity of our platform during elections"". 
He said the firm would have more to share in coming weeks including ""further steps we're taking regarding political accounts on TikTok"".
Other big social media companies have also set out how they would prepare for the election.
Meta's announcement largely continued measures already deployed in previous elections including a ban on new political, electoral and social issue ads during the final week of the election campaign.

ke Beijing for example. 
re has not been a significant drop in infections, yet public transport now no longer requires a PCR test result, bars and restaurants are slowly re-opening, and in some cases people are being allowed to isolate at home after catching Covid instead of going into centralised quarantine facilities.
From Tuesday test results are no longer needed to go into supermarkets, office buildings and some other public venues.
So when you examine what is happening here right now, the trajectory seems clear - the government appears to have quietly dumped zero Covid as a goal.
mean that all Covid-related restrictions have ended - you still need to have taken a test in the past 48 hours to get into hospitals, schools, restaurants and gyms, for example. It also does not mean some restrictions won't be around in, say, half a year.
But the stated goal of reducing each outbreak to zero new infections… gone.
w plan appears to be to slow the spread of the virus, hopefully enabling the health system to cope, rather than trying crush the disease.
may involve monitoring the virus as it spreads in an attempt to manage the flow of infections, serious illness and deaths. 
At times it may also mean the reimposition of certain measures, but cities will not have to record zero cases to remain open.
Beijing is not alone in removing some measures - and they vary widely by region.
In south-eastern Zhejiang province for example, there is to be no more regular testing apart from for people working certain specific jobs.
Shandong province in the east will no longer require checks to buy cough medicine or drive on a highway; central Henan Province will no longer require PCR tests to enter housing communities. 
Similar easing is also happening in the massive cities of Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Chengdu.
Urumqi, capital of western Xinjiang region, has re-opened supermarkets, hotels, cinemas and gyms. Public transport has resumed in Tibet.
Just a few weeks ago, the Chinese government was urging the population to stay the course with the zero-Covid approach. 
Despite overwhelming evidence that China's epidemic control measures were hammering the economy, smashing people's livelihoods, Xi Jinping stood up at the Great Hall of the People during the recent Communist Party Congress and re-stated that there would be no swerving from his signature policy.
me the protests.
A tower block fire in Urumqi killed 10 people, triggering a wave of public fury.
On social media, the deaths were blamed on Covid restrictions, which are said to have hampered the access of fire crews and blocked escape routes for residents. Beijing denies this and the BBC has not been able to verify the claims, but that the fire led to demonstrations across the country is not in dispute.
China fire was government's fault - victim's daughter
In city after city, protesters demanded an end to zero Covid. They wanted their old lives back. Some people started calling for Xi Jinping to resign.
re have not been such widespread acts of public defiance against the party since the 1989 political upheaval which led to the bloody crackdown in and around Tiananmen Square.
Suddenly changes are being made - and Chinese people are making jokes about how protests do actually work.
Last week's death of former leader Jiang Zemin put even more pressure on the government. His era is viewed by many, nostalgically, as a period of reconnecting with the outside world and high-speed growth. The comparisons with the current situation are stark.
r danger for Xi Jinping's administration was that acts of public mourning could transform into yet more protests. This had happened decades earlier after reformist leader Hu Yaobang died and crowds gathering to mark his passing transformed into the Tiananmen Square protest movement.
All this has led to a government that had drastically underestimated public anger at its Covid measures now abruptly changing tack.
A face-saving way of doing this has been required.
Officials in China were never going to come out and apologise to people for keeping them cooped up much longer than necessary.
But the party is beginning to change its public messaging via state media, now saying that new strains of Covid are not nearly as deadly. 
r change from the previous line that the rest of the world was going through Covid hell and citizens should consider themselves lucky to live in China where they were being kept safe.
wo significant challenges remain.
Firstly, the effort to get more people vaccinated, especially the elderly and those in high-risk groups, has been inadequate. Official figures show just 40% of people over the age of 80 have had a booster shot. Elderly unvaccinated people made up huge swathes of the deaths in Hong Kong.
Secondly, officials have had years to expand China's hospital ICU capacity. This remains inadequate, so a rush of emergency patients following any dramatic escalation in Covid cases would really test the health system.
For this reason, the goal will be to move forward slowly, trying to ensure that hospitals are not swamped. If they are then restrictions can always be reimposed.
China's new path will evolve step by step, even if it sometimes means going backwards again."	/news/world-asia-china-63857194
health	Mental health patients sent miles due to bed shortage	"Hundreds of mental health patients in England are sent to hospitals miles from home each month because of local bed shortages - more than a year after the NHS aimed to end the practice.
NHS data shows that 630 patients were in inappropriate out of area placements (OAPs) at the end of August 2022.
Experts say such placements, which the NHS said would end by March 2021, are traumatic for patients and costly.
government said it was investing an extra £2.3bn in mental health services.
An inappropriate OAP is when someone is sent to a hospital in a different area because no beds are free locally. 
Of the 630 patients in inappropriate OAPs in August 2022, more than half were sent away that month. 
In 2019, Kelly was sectioned and - because no local bed was free - sent to a hospital 23 miles from her home. 
""I didn't have anything on me"", she says, ""I only had my phone and the clothes that I was in.""
With family members too far away to bring her possessions, the hospital provided basics: pyjamas, trousers, a T-shirt, one pair of socks and two pieces of underwear. 
""All I could wear were the pyjamas and the same top and trousers every day for three weeks,"" says Kelly.
""It was just awful. When you're stuck in a strange place as it is... It's even more distressing not having your own familiar things to take comfort in.""
Shortly after her discharge, Kelly was sectioned again - this time closer to home. She says this made a ""massive difference"", adding: ""When you're closer to home you've got your friends and your family coming to visit you and take you out for a walk.""
Paul Spencer, the charity Mind's head of health, policy & campaigns, describes OAPs as traumatic, isolating and costly to the NHS. He says that ""people are cut off from their support networks right at the very moment they need them most"".
More than half of patients are sent more than 60 miles (100km) from home. 
Dr Adrian James, president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says ""statistically, if you're sent away from your local area, you stay in hospital longer"".
""For some areas it looks like there aren't enough beds and for some areas, it is that there aren't alternatives to admission. Focusing on care in the community is really important,"" says Dr James.
Almost £10m was spent on inappropriate OAPs in August, with 94% of placement days spent with private organisations. Private beds are often more expensive.
NHS had planned to eliminate inappropriate OAPs in adult acute inpatient care by 2020-21. 
Since that deadline, 5,800 patients have been sent on inappropriate OAPs. This has cost the NHS more than £165m. 
""It's incredibly disheartening to see progress stall on reversing the number of inappropriate OAPs"", says Mr Spencer. 
""We know that it is possible to stop OAPs and some trusts are doing much better than others. Over the coming year we need a sharper focus in those areas where people are being repeatedly let down. 
""We need the prime minister to urgently recommit to delivering a cross-government mental health plan.""
An NHS spokesperson said: ""Mental health services are committed to ending inappropriate OAPs as quickly and as safely as possible and the number of new patients sent out of area has halved over the last three years.
""While the pandemic has led to a significant increase in service pressures through a combination of a high number of bed closures, staff absences, and higher levels of mental health need - the NHS has treated tens of thousands more people in the community since the publication of the NHS Long Term Plan and will continue to work with social care colleagues to reduce rising length of stay in mental health settings."" 
Across England, patients spent a total of 191,515 inappropriate OAPs days in the year ending this August, down 19% from the year before. 
But 25 trusts saw an increase in the number of days patients spent in OAPs, with 12 trusts recording their highest figure of OAP days yet. 
When Claire, not her real name, was suicidal in 2020, she was sent to a private hospital 80 miles away. She spent 18 months there. 
""I had no idea where I was going. They said there were no beds in our local area and brought me to East Sussex. I've never stepped foot in East Sussex before,"" she says.
""I was terrified. I was hundreds of miles away from my family. I was asking to go home, to see my mum. I didn't know the psychiatrists, I didn't know the people there.""
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Everyone should have access to safe, appropriate mental health care close to home, and while the pandemic has had a significant impact on capacity in mental health services, we remain committed to reducing inappropriate OAPs for patients.""
rtment said it is investing an extra £2.3bn annually in mental health services by 2024. NHS England is providing an extra £10m to support mental health services this winter to ""deal with record demand"".
If you are affected by issues raised, support is available at the BBC Action Line.
Note: Data is provisional and subject to change. Not all trusts submit OAP data; this August, 79% participated. NHS Digital says a cyber incident may have had ""limited"" impact on participation."	/news/uk-england-63596763

politics	Nadine Dorries writing book about downfall of Boris Johnson	"Watch: Boris Johnson: A career in moments
Former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries is writing a book about the political downfall of former PM Boris Johnson.
Mr Johnson was forced to quit in July by the resignation of dozens of his ministers after a series of scandals.
One of the first to go was then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak, whom some Conservative MPs accused of betraying the prime minister.
Ms Dorries' literary agent told the BBC the book would be published next autumn and its working title was The Plot.
He said she had already begun writing it. 
He described it as ""a political whodunnit: murder on the Downing Street express"".
""who want to know whose fingerprints are on the knife will have to buy the book"", he added. 
A former nurse, born in Liverpool, the MP for Mid Bedfordshire is already a successful author of romantic historical novels set in Liverpool and Ireland. 
During the Conservative leadership contest, which followed Mr Johnson's resignation, she was repeatedly critical of Mr Sunak, accusing him of leading a ""ruthless coup"".  
When Mr Sunak resigned as chancellor, he blamed divisions over economic policy and the government's integrity. 
He lost the contest to Liz Truss, but then replaced her when she quit just over six weeks later amid the economic and political turmoil which followed the September mini-budget. 
Mr Johnson had indicated he would run in a leadership contest, opening the way to a return to Downing Street, but pulled out, clearing the way for Mr Sunak to take over. 
Despite her criticisms of Mr Sunak, the Evening Standard reported that Ms Dorries was playing down suggestions her book would point the finger at the new prime minister for forcing Mr Johnson out.  
She has frequently argued Mr Johnson is the only Tory leader who can beat Labour at the next general election. 
She recently told The House magazine: ""He will be back. I don't know when, I don't know how, I don't know whether it will be 10 years or 10 months.""
Ms Dorries is thought to have been nominated for a peerage in Mr Johnson's resignation honours list, though her appointment is believed to have been delayed to avoid triggering a by-election.  
Conservative MP Julian Knight, who chairs the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, told the Evening Standard: ""I'm sure the book may give Rishi some sleepless nights. Nadine is not known for her forgiving streak, and I imagine she won't pull any punches when naming names and pointing the finger.
""It's all part of a thread of covert asides at the new regime… you have a rump of Johnsonites and then those sacked by Liz Truss. There's a lot of discontented people around."""	/news/uk-politics-63654000

""Dad could move but we still needed to get him to hospital. It was clear something was going on,"" she said.
""Within five minutes, [of the 999 call] he just stood there, he couldn't talk.""
Ms La-Mont's brother, who was working nearby, decided to drive their father to the accident and emergency department rather than wait.
""It's just lucky that he could walk really,"" she said. ""Could he not, it would all be a different scenario.""
Ms La-Mont said her father was seen ""very quickly"", within five minutes of arrival at Ipswich Hospital. 
She said medics confirmed  bleed on the brain after a CT scan. He was given medication to disperse a blood clot. 
Ms La-Mont said he received excellent treatment at the hospital but was concerned about the state of the ambulance service.
""It's hard. There's not enough of them,"" she said.
Her father was discharged on Saturday and is now recovering at home, but will require speech therapy.
In a statement, the East of England Ambulance Service Trust (EEAST) said: ""The NHS is currently facing incredibly high demand and we are working very closely with hospitals to reduce handover delays and improve care to our patients.  
""When demand is at its highest we regret that we are sometimes unable to send ambulances as quickly as we would wish, even to our most serious patients. 
""We are working very closely with our NHS partners to reduce handover delays at hospitals to get more ambulance crews back out into the community to improve care for our patients. 
""We are also working to reduce the number of patients going to hospital, including directing patients to urgent community response services when appropriate.""

rage player would have to play for 10 hours more than usual per day to notice any difference, it found. And the reasons for playing were far more likely to have an impact.
Well-being was measured by asking about life satisfaction and levels of emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger and frustration.
results contradict a 2020 study.
Conducted by the same department at the Oxford Internet Institute - but with a much smaller group of players - the 2020 study had suggested that those who played for longer were happier.
""Common sense says if you have more free time to play video games, you're probably a happier person,"" said Prof Andrew Przybylski, who worked on both studies.
""But contrary to what we might think about games being good or bad for us, we found [in this latest study] pretty conclusive evidence that how much you play doesn't really have any bearing whatsoever on changes in well-being.
""If players were playing because they wanted to, rather than because they felt compelled to, they had to, they tended to feel better.""

entertainment	'Digital newsletters really humanise you to your readers'	"Author Elle Griffin says she would definitely turn down a book deal if she was ever offered one.
""I'd never accept one… traditional book publishing is full of bad math, and even worse marketing,"" says the 37-year-old writer of gothic novels.
Last year, instead of releasing her first book, called Obscurity, as physical copies in High Street bookstores, or as a Kindle version to download, she started to self-publish chapters as email instalments.
Using online publishing platform Substack, the new chapters were emailed out every week or two to Ms Griffin's subscribers. 
She already had more than 3,000 non-paying followers before she started to release the book, as she had for a number of years been writing articles on numerous topics.
But by the end of the first 12 months of her novel's serialisation her subscriber numbers had more than doubled, thanks to recommendations from readers and other Substack account holders.
Based in Salt Lake City, Utah, Ms Griffin now has 6,843 subscribers, and, crucially, 301 paying ones.
re charged from $10 (£8.60) a month, or $50 per annum, and Ms Griffin says in the first year she earned nearly $18,000.
With many of us spending more time online than ever before, writing coach Nancy Erickson says it makes sense for novelists like Ms Griffin to focus on offering readers direct digital access to their work.
""What you really want to do is meet your audience wherever they're already engaged,"" says Ms Erickson, who is based in St Louis, Missouri. She adds that digital engagement ""helps authors build their brands, as well as finding other revenue generating activities"".
Jane Ostler is executive vice president of global thought leadership at brand consulting company Kantar. She sees online serialisation as an effective form of digital marketing, a way for new writers to get themselves better known. ""I think there is a lot of potential here for a new writer,"" she says.
While prolific Nottingham-based author Kristina Adams hasn't serialised any of her 16 self-published novels and three non-fiction titles, she has been sending free weekly digital newsletters about literature and life to subscribers since 2014. This was two years before the now 32-year-old released her first book.
She continues to send these emails out to more than 2,500 people via a service called MailerLite. They include stories about things referenced in her books, talks about her dog Millie, and promotion of upcoming releases.
""Digital newsletters in particular, I think more than social media, really humanise you to your readers,"" says Ms Adams, who writes romance titles under her full name, and ghost stories as KC Adams. ""It gives you a much closer connection.
""And sending out the newsletters really makes a different to sales. Every time I sent one out I get an up-turn in sales.
""You can think that you are sending out far too many, but in most cases only about a fifth of people will open each email. So while you think you are shouting and demanding attention, most subscribers wouldn't see it that way.""
Back in Salt Lake City, Ms Griffin is now serialising her second novel. She says she was inspired to release her book in instalments by 19th Century French writer Alexandre Dumas.
Like her, he wrote gothic fiction, and his well-known novel The Count of Monte Cristo was serialised in a Parisian weekly newspaper in the 1840s.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
As is the norm for Substack, people can read the chapters of Ms Griffin's novels for free via her page on the app and website.
However, paying subscribers get extra benefits, such as the ability to read Ms Griffin's commentaries, post their own thoughts, chat with other subscribers, and even write and publish their own essays.
Ms Griffin says all this feedback is very helpful.
""Recently, two readers mentioned that they wished my chapters were longer, so I started making them longer,"" she says. ""I love being able to respond in real-time.""
Ms Griffin adds that she had researched self-publishing her books in digital form via Amazon, but that her subscription model is far more lucrative.
She explains the maths. ""Say I sold 1,000 books on Amazon, then I'd make $1,000, maybe more, maybe $5,000.
""But if I - instead of just selling it - adopted a subscription model, and charged readers $8 or $9 a month, then from the same 1,000 fans, I could presumably make $100,000 in salary.""
She adds that with a traditional book deal she'd be even worse off financially, as she'd likely only get a royalty rate of around 15% of revenues.
In addition to the subscription payments, Ms Griffin's followers can pay to buy and download the digital artwork that she designs for each chapter.
""I think the beauty of it [serialisation] is you can start grassroots, and start from the bottom,"" she says. ""I'm not Stephen King, I'm just barely getting started.""

33-year-old competes in Super League Triathlon's 2022 Championship Series Grand Finale in Saudi Arabia.
Stanford said ""reality had not set in"" that she would be competing for the last time on Saturday.
""On one hand I'm quite sad and some of the messages I've received have been quite tear inducing and really touching,"" she said.
""They've helped me reflect on the career I've had.
""Although this is my decision and I'm ready for the next step it seems really strange that it is going to be my last race.
""But on the flip side I'm really excited about the future.""
Bridgend-born and raised in Swansea, Stanford was a promising young track and cross country athlete before switching to triathlon.
She was 2012 ITU Under-23 World Champion before becoming senior World champion a year later.
""Now and again I've sat down and thought about my career as a whole and what I've been lucky enough to do, the places that I've been and the competitions I've been to ,"" Stanford told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
""I have a little bit of an appreciation but I don't think it's really going to sink in until the months that follow.
""I've had a really busy few months because I started work with British Triathlon at the start of October, so the last month has been absolutely hectic and I've barely had time to sit down.
""I've also got my wedding next month so I think probably in the New Year when the wedding and honeymoon is done and life settles down and I get more into a normal routine I will reflect on it.
""When you're an athlete you never take that time and you're always looking at the next event, the next race.""
Stanford's final season of competition saw her win gold at the European Championships in Munich in August, her final major international competition.
was preceded at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, when she won silver for Wales in the mixed triathlon relay.
""It's always been a lifelong dream to stand on a podium and see the Welsh flag flying and to finally fulfil that in Birmingham this year was really special.
""It was really special to do that as part of a team in such an individual sport. But on this one occasion to stand there with three other members of the Welsh team and experience that moment was really special.
""It's definitely something that will always stand out when I think about my career.""
In Saturday's final race in Neom, Stanford - who has taken up a role as assistant coach with British Triathlon - returns after recovering from a calf injury.
""I'm trying to not get too emotional beforehand and I can stand on the start line as calm as possible,"" Stanford said.
""I have no expectations going into the race. I haven't actually run in the last five weeks because of my calf and this will be my first run for quite a while.
""I will stand there with a smile, soak it all up and enjoy it and give it my all one last time.""

business	Train strikes: Rail workers to strike in run-up to Christmas	"Rail passengers face disruption in the run-up to Christmas after the RMT union announced more strike dates.
Industrial action will be held across four 48-hour periods on 13-14 and 16-17 December, and 3-4 and 6-7 January.
Services have been severely disrupted in recent months as the row over pay, working conditions and job security has continued.
But the RMT said the latest strike action would send ""a clear message"" that workers want a better deal.
Its members at Network Rail and 14 train companies voted last week in favour of further walkouts.
More than 40,000 RMT members are expected to take part, the union said, after its bosses held a meeting on Tuesday to decide on the latest dates. 
RMT said there would also be an overtime ban from 18 December until 2 January, meaning the union will be taking industrial action for four weeks in total.
How will the rail strikes affect your journey? Get in touch.
rikes mean passengers will face disruption in the run-up to Christmas and while travelling to events such as performances by comedian Peter Kay in London and Birmingham on 16 and 17 December, as well as Paolo Nutini's gigs in Glasgow on 13, 14 and 16 December.
It also includes signalling staff, which means it is likely that only a small minority of services will run on main lines, while smaller branches will have no trains at all.
Separately, the Aslef union, which represents drivers, is holding another strike on Saturday 26 November in a dispute over pay. It affects 12 train companies.
In a statement, the RMT's general secretary Mick Lynch said: ""Our message to the public is, we are sorry to inconvenience you, but we urge you to direct your anger and frustration at the government and railway employers during this latest phase of action.""
RMT suggested that Network Rail, which maintains the railways throughout Britain, had failed to make an improved offer during the last two weeks of talks. The union suspended strike action due to take place in early November, following what it said was a promise of an offer.
Network Rail's chief negotiator Tim Shoveller said: ""No-one can deny the precarious financial hole in which the railway finds itself. 
""Striking makes that hole bigger and the task of finding a resolution ever more difficult,"" he said, adding that the organisation was still hoping for a ""breakthrough"" during negotiations.
RMT union also accused the government of ""directly interfering"" with attempts to reach a settlement.
But the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, said: ""We made real progress over the last fortnight of talks, and for the first time in months we can see the outline of a credible deal.""
Its spokesman called on the RMT union to ""stay at the negotiating table"" for the benefit of passengers travelling or shopping over the festive season, as well as businesses in hospitality and retail who are dependent on trade at this time of year.
RMT union has already held eight days of strikes since June, which have caused widespread disruption.
Claire Smith, a hotelier from Blackpool, said further strikes would be ""very disruptive"" to the hotel trade in the Lancashire seaside resort.
She said that despite action in the summer it had been a ""good season"", partly due to the widespread chaos at airports due to staff shortages.
""But now is a very different situation,"" she said.
People are cutting back due to cost of living pressures, Ms Smith said, and the beginning of the year up to Easter is normally a lean time for hotels anyway, so ""anything that's going to add to the difficult times"" is ""going to have a huge impact, because we're all struggling"".
""So we're put in a very difficult position by this,"" Ms Smith added. 
""December is a very busy period for us. It's our last bite of the apple.
""Of course we have huge sympathy for the strikers, and just wish they would do more negotiating round the table.""
rail industry is under pressure to save money after the pandemic left a hole in its finances. Bosses say reforms need to be agreed to afford pay increases and modernise the railway.
But unions say salaries should increase to reflect the rising cost of living.
A spokesperson for the Department for Transport criticised unions involved in the strikes, saying: ""Strike action risks putting the very future of the entire industry in jeopardy.
""The rail industry is facing serious financial challenges and is in desperate need of vital reforms to address them.  
""We once again urge union leaders to work with employers and come to an agreement which is fair for passengers, taxpayers and workers alike.""
Earlier this month, Rail Minister Huw Merriman estimated that strike action had cost the railways about half a billion pounds so far this year.
wo and half weeks ago, the RMT called off three strike days and unions and employers began ""intensive"" negotiations.
Instead of a breakthrough being announced, the dispute has now intensified.
w strikes will happen at a crucial time of year for retailers and hospitality venues, as well as disrupting the festive plans of millions of passengers.
Network Rail and the Rail Delivery group both say progress had been made in talks over the past fortnight.
However Mick Lynch's tone today did not suggest a deal was close. He suggested passengers should blame the government not rail workers.
He is due to meet Transport Secretary Mark Harper on Thursday. But the government insists it's not holding up negotiations, and it's for unions and the rail employers to come up with an agreement between them."	/news/business-63715658
sports	Paris 2024 Olympic Games opens artistic swimming to men	"Men will be able to compete in Olympic artistic swimming, formerly known as synchronised swimming, for the first time at the Paris 2024 Games.
International Olympic Committee (IOC) has approved up to two men being picked in the eight-strong team event.
Men have been able to compete in artistic swimming at the World Championships since 2015.
It has been a women-only discipline at the Olympics since it was introduced at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.
Italian Giorgio Minisini, who won two world mixed duet gold medals alongside Lucrezia Ruggiero in Hungary in June, welcomed the decision.
""Our sport's evolution towards inclusivity is going on fast forward,"" he said.
Find out how to get into swimming with our special guide.
""This decision from the IOC and World Aquatics will help us become an example for the whole Olympic movement. ""
American Bill May, the first-ever male world champion in the inaugural mixed duet technical event in 2015, also heralded the landmark.
""The inclusion of men was once considered the impossible dream,"" he said. 
""This proves that we should all dream big. The male athletes have endured. Now, through their perseverance and the help and support of so many, all athletes may stand alongside each other equally, reaching for Olympic glory.""  
However, some female swimmers have previously opposed men's inclusion.

politics	Suella Braverman was in denial over forced resignation, sources say	"Suella Braverman was ""amazed"" and ""in denial"" over being forced to resign for breaching the ministerial code, according to sources. 
Ms Braverman stood down as then PM Liz Truss's home secretary on 19 October after admitting to a ""technical infringement"" by sending an official document from a personal email account. 
A number of sources have disputed Ms Braverman's version of events. 
Rishi Sunak is facing questions over reappointing her six days later.
w prime minister defended his decision to make Ms Braverman his home secretary, saying ""she made an error of judgment, but she recognised that, she raised the matter and she accepted her mistake"".
BBC has spoken to several people with knowledge of the events surrounding Ms Braverman's resignation. 
A number of them dispute Ms Braverman's claim to have reported her mistake to the cabinet secretary - the head of the civil service - as soon as she realised.  
When confronted about her transgression she attempted to play down and explain away what had happened, sources suggested.
Ms Braverman had emailed a draft written ministerial statement on immigration policy to her close political ally, Conservative MP Sir John Hayes, using her personal email instead of her official government account.  
ument made reference to plans to ""make changes to the visa system to support economic growth"" and to ""ensure our visa system supports priority growth projects"" and ""extending the high potential individual visa route"", the BBC understands.
Ms Braverman had intended to copy in Sir John Hayes's wife, who works in his office. But she chose the wrong recipient and instead sent it to a staff member of another Conservative MP, Andrew Percy, early in the morning of 19 October. 
When Mr Percy became aware of what had happened, he approached the chief whip, who is responsible for party discipline. The chief whip in turn passed the issue on to Number 10 and the Cabinet Office. 
It's understood Mr Percy's office also made Ms Braverman aware of the error shortly after the mistaken email was received. 
Cabinet Secretary Simon Case advised then prime minister Ms Truss that ""it was an open and shut case of the ministerial code being breached"", according to one government insider. He had not by then been approached by the home secretary herself, according to sources.
Sir Keir advises Rishi Sunak: ""He should sack her - that would be the strong thing to do. That's what I would do if I was PM.""
Downing Street has insisted it won't comment on the ""timeline"" of events. 
One source told me ""initially [Ms Braverman] was in a state of denial"" when Ms Truss made it clear that afternoon she would have to resign. 
""She was saying it was a minor thing,"" the same source added.
Another said Ms Braverman was ""amazed"" that Ms Truss took the view she did. 
A source close to the home secretary said any suggestion she was confronted by the cabinet secretary with evidence of the breach was false, adding: ""In advance of the meeting with the prime minister, she had communicated it proactively via official channels, to the cabinet secretary.""
Instead of waiting for the resignation to be choreographed by Number 10, Ms Braverman published her resignation letter on Twitter last Wednesday evening. 
In the letter, Ms Braverman said she had ""serious concerns"" about Ms Truss's government's commitment to reducing migration numbers.
Labour is calling on Mr Sunak to sack Ms Braverman, claiming that she poses a potential security risk.
rty is also demanding ""urgent reassurances"" that the leaked email did not contain ""market sensitive information""."	/news/uk-politics-63433252
health	Woman who shed weight to qualify for IVF becomes pregnant	"A woman who had to lose weight to qualify for IVF treatment is celebrating becoming pregnant.
Marie Cheetham and her partner Paul Sbardella had been trying for a baby but she has a condition that made it harder for her to conceive.
32-year-old was told her body mass index (BMI) was too high for her to get an NHS-funded IVF cycle in Derby.
She said it had prompted her to change her diet and lifestyle and she subsequently lost a stone (6.3kg).
Ms Cheetham, from Littleover in Derby, said she was able to bring her BMI down below the threshold to make her eligible for IVF in the city.
Now, after successful treatment, she is expecting her first child in June despite having polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that affects how the ovaries work.
She said: ""In Derby, the NHS funds just one IVF cycle and we'd already started the process when doctors said we couldn't proceed due to my weight.  
""They gave me a three-month deadline to lower my BMI to below 30. To be honest it was the most stressful part of the process.""
Ms Cheetham had help losing weight from the Derby City Council-run Livewell healthy lifestyle service which advised her on exercise routines and diet.
She said: ""When I went back to the clinic in July, I'd achieved my goal - my BMI was 29 and the IVF cycle was approved to continue.""
Ms Cheetham said the three-minute wait for the pregnancy test result was the longest of her life.
She said: ""I was so shocked at the positive line that I bought more.
""I don't think we actually believed it was real until we saw the scan at seven weeks.
""When I had the push back of not going further with our fertility treatment, it felt a huge hill to climb.
""If there's one message I want to pass on, it's if you have a bad day, keep going - don't give it up.""
Livewell adviser Casey Baxter said: ""I know how hard Marie has worked to lower her BMI, particularly when it was only a small reduction she needed, which can make it so much harder.
""I was so pleased when Marie told me she was approved for the IVF treatment and absolutely thrilled when she discovered she was pregnant.""

politics	Pressure on Chris Pincher to resign as MP intensifies	"Calls for the former Deputy Chief Whip Chris Pincher to resign as an MP have intensified from within his Tamworth constituency.
Mr Pincher, who stepped down from his government job in July, was suspended from the parliamentary party following allegations he groped two men at a private members club in London.
He apologised for drinking ""far too much"" and embarrassing himself ""and other people"".
Mr Pincher continues to sit as an independent MP, but were he to resign it would trigger a by-election in the Staffordshire seat he has held since 2010.
furore surrounding the case has caused deep divisions within the local Tory party.
In July, the former Conservative leader of Tamworth Council, Daniel Cook said he too had been ""groped"" by Mr Pincher on two occasions dating back to 2005 and 2006 - accusations Mr Pincher strongly denied.
Since then Mr Cook and six fellow Conservative councillors have left the party and formed a new independent group, called Independent Future which is now the official opposition on the authority.
Speaking on the BBC's Politics Midlands, Mr Cook said the atmosphere within the local party had become toxic.
""It tore the Conservative Party in Tamworth apart, the ugly part of it certainly came to the fore, and there were many of us which just couldn't stand to watch it couldn't stand to be a part of it,"" he said.
Behind the scenes a number of Conservatives have said they see no way back for the man who precipitated the fall of Boris Johnson.
However, locally some of those who have called for Mr Pincher to go, said they believed attempts were being made to rehabilitate his image.
ressure for a resolution has intensified as the deadline for Conservative MPs to state whether or not they intend to run at the next general election approaches.
Conservative Campaign Headquarters (CCHQ) has set the cut-off for Monday. 
Several Conservative MPs including the former chancellor and Bromsgrove MP Sajid Javid have already announced they will not stand.
On Monday night an extraordinary meeting of Tamworth Borough Council was held, and outside several dozen protesters gathered calling for Mr Pincher to resign. 
Claire Lewis who helped organise the demonstration said: ""I'm hoping Mr Pincher does the right thing and resigns. 
""He's obviously not about in the community… and we're kind of MP-less as such, so we would like a by-election so the people of Tamworth can decide.""
Responding to those calls the deputy leader of the local Conservatives councillor Robert Pritchard said the future of the MP was something local members ""didn't have control over"" and they were ""waiting for the outcome of the investigation"". 
Mr Pincher is currently subject to an investigation opened on 20 October by Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Katherine Stone.  
rliamentary website says it relates to ""actions causing significant damage to the reputation of the House"".
king on Politics Midlands, Conservative MP Philip Dunne said Mr Pincher was ""innocent until proven otherwise"".
In response to Mr Dunne's comment, Labour MP Jess Philips responded: ""I don't think we'd feel that way if this was a teacher in my son's school or a police officer.""
Mr Pincher's office declined a request to be interviewed, saying he was not available. 
However, in a Facebook post last month he said: ""It's been a really very difficult few months for me and my family. 
""I've been lucky to receive some very good medical and mental health support which has helped, and I'm still taking medication. 
""I've been doing casework along with my office team to try to ensure constituents get the help they need or get their issues addressed.""

health	Midnight discharge at Colchester Hospital unacceptable - family	"Lack of beds in the NHS and social care sector have been highlighted by the case of an 81-year-old woman discharged home at night, her family said.
Janice Field attended Colchester Hospital in Essex with a suspected heart attack.
She was returned to her flat at midnight, despite having no home care at that time of day.
rust said it focused on keeping patients safe and was ""sorry to hear about the concerns raised"".
Ms Field was checked out at the hospital last week and deemed fit to go home, but her family said she should have stayed in hospital overnight, or be found a community care bed.
Her daughter-in-law, Sarah Field, a qualified nurse, said: ""To discharge an 81-year-old lady and have them having to be transferred in the middle of the night is totally unacceptable. 
""But the nurse we spoke to was emphatic. She was desperate. She said, 'no, we have no beds. This has got to happen. She's clinically fit. She has got to go'.
""Older people have paid their dues into society. They have worked hard. They need more respect than this.
""The NHS is broken, under-resourced and not fit for purpose. This is not the fault of those that work in it, but the fault of the system.""
Ruth French, operations director for Stow Healthcare, which runs Brandon Park and other care homes in Suffolk, Norfolk and Essex, said: ""I think there are significant breakdowns in the system at the moment. 
""The clear evidence for this is that we have hospital wards that are chock-a-block. 
""That position is only going to get worse through winter and we know there are beds sitting available in most care homes where those people can be better looked after.""
Stow Healthcare said it paid a living wage to attract workers, but it struggled to offer council-funded placements.
""This room is rented out for £1,200 a week. Social service rates pay a little over half of that,"" said Ms French.
""The cost of providing quality care is really high and there has been a massive hike in energy prices we have all seen this year.""
Colin Noble, a Conservative member of Tory-run Suffolk County Council, and a representative of the County Councils Network, said local authorities were also being stretched financially in the provision of social care.
""All the time we are playing a little bit of catch-up and are always short of the funding we need for the services we would all want in our older life,"" he said.
A spokeswoman for the East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust (ESNEFT), which runs Colchester and Ipswich hospitals, said in response to Mrs Field's concerns: ""We are doing everything we can to respond to the high demand for our services, care, and treatment across our communities and to deliver the best possible care. 
""Keeping our patients safe is always our focus.""
Dr Angela Tillett, chief medical officer at ESNEFT, said: ""We were very sorry to hear about the concerns raised with the BBC by the family of Mrs Field about her care. 
""Our dedicated patient advice and liaison service (PALS) is here to help anyone who has feedback about their experiences in our hospitals and they can liaise with clinical colleagues on a patient's behalf.""
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""We have prioritised health and social care in the Autumn Statement, with up to £7.5bn available over the next two years to support adult social care services - equivalent to 200,000 additional care packages and the biggest funding increase in history.
""The NHS is also creating the equivalent of 7,000 more beds this winter - enabling hospitals to treat patients sooner, including by using remote monitoring to provide care at home or in the community.""

technology	Skilled tech workers snapped up despite downturn	"Jaydeep Vacchani, a software developer in Toronto, began to hunt for a new job just as the surge of layoffs in the technology sector spread across the world.
Mr Vacchani found that his expertise in automation and cloud technology was in demand, and in October he had five interviews on the go.
Using cloud technology involves shifting data storage and processing to a third party like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft Azure. Meanwhile automation, in this case, means building software that streamlines labour-intensive work, like processing paperwork.
By November Mr Vacchani had found a ""perfect fit"" at sherpa°, a remote-only tech firm offering customers a way to secure travel visa documentation online.
""I like to work with a company that is focused on the user experience, especially when it comes to a product I can relate to, since I also had a challenging time trying to get the right visa paperwork when I moved to Canada from India,"" says Mr Vacchani, who is now a developer at the company's automation team.
He says this wave of heavy layoffs didn't faze him because of the demand for his skills: coding in the Javascript language, and managing the infrastructure for products and data housed in the cloud.
When Alex Gogan, VP of Engineering at sherpa°, seeks qualified candidates for software developer roles, he looks for a ""sweet spot of those who enjoy creative and collaborative work, and are really good at it, too.""
While the start-up first wanted to grow by hiring generalists in the tech sector, Mr Gogan says today they are seeking specialists who can focus on scaling the company and help others who may need mentoring.
It is a good time to be hiring workers with those kinds of skills. 
More than 900 tech companies have laid off 143,500 employees in 2022 alone, according to Layoffs.fyi which has been tracking layoffs in the tech sector since 2020. 
major tech firms have been slimming their workforces since the height of the pandemic.
Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, laid off more than 11,000 employees, and in November Amazon began letting go more than 10,000 staffers.
Some experts see these moves as a self-correction from the bloated workforces created during the pandemic, when tech companies such as Amazon and Shopify prospered during months when other businesses suffered. 
""The money spigot is not flowing at the same rate as it used to be,"" says Margaret O'Mara, author of The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.
""There's been a real softening of external capital resources, like VC (venture capital) funds, that had been propping up companies in Silicon Valley and beyond,"" she says.
rise in tech worker layoffs is also indicative of two other trends in this market, according to Lu Zhang, managing director of VC firm Fusion Fund in California. ""Companies now feel an urgency to reserve cash, and founders see those high salaries they once offered as not being very cost-efficient.""
As for the tech skills in high demand now, in Silicon Valley she sees demand for engineers experienced in artificial intelligence (AI) tech and data science.
reas are sought-after because companies are focusing on collecting and processing data, to better organise their business and learn more about their customers.
An OECD report echoes Ms Zhang: Job postings for digital roles in the US increased by 24% between 2018 and 2021, led by a 116% increase in adverts for data engineers.
Ms O'Mara sees another set of skillshiring tech companies find desirable: compassion and empathy. ""While there has been such a relentless focus on engineering skills, companies want to ensure that there are voices in the room that understand the sociology of the products they produce and the impact they have on various geographies and political systems,"" she says. 
She adds, ""With the money engine slowing done, I'd like to see more large, influential companies enter that stage of maturity.""
More technology of business:
Craig Freedberg, from UK-based specialist recruitment firm, Robert Half, says businesses will still have a need for tech resources and software development projects.
However, he thinks companies will be reluctant to expand their workforces and will instead turn to temporary tech workers.
""We've seen similar scenarios in other economic downturns and are already beginning to experience this shift in balance,"" he says.
What may also shift in the coming months is a ripple effect from the boom in remote work caused by the pandemic.
According to a recent report from Deloitte, most Gen Z (75%) and millennials (76%) would prefer to split home work with office work, or work full-time at home.
Could this erode Silicon Valley's attraction for ambitious software engineers and developers? After all, other cities like Lisbon and Toronto are offering attractive tax breaks in the hope of attracting tech entrepreneurs. 
Author Margaret O'Mara does not see a big exodus. ""Companies come here for the talent, to recruit the best people, and that's still happening in Silicon Valley,"" she notes.
But venture capitalist Lu Zhang views it another way. ""The new normal will be to rely on the core values within Silicon Valley to help founders get started and create their initial products and learn about market fit, but then to expand outside those borders to leverage talent outside Silicon Valley and remotely hire from other tech hubs."""	/news/business-63871090
sports	Marcus Rashford was dropped after oversleeping and missing Manchester United meeting	"Marcus Rashford has said he was dropped from Manchester United's starting XI against Wolves because he missed a team meeting after oversleeping.
Manager Erik ten Hag praised the 25-year-old after he came on to score the winner in the second half at Molineux.
But the Dutchman said breaches of internal discipline at Old Trafford have to be punished if his team are to be successful this season.
""Everyone has to match the standards and rules,"" said Ten Hag. 
""[If they don't] there has to be consequences. 
""That is what I expect on the pitch, otherwise you can't be successful. When you miss rules outside the pitch, it can go onto the pitch. He gave the right answer.""
Rashford revealed the nature of his disciplinary breach in a post-match TV interview.
He said he was ""disappointed"" to be dropped, but added: ""I understand the decision and obviously I am happy we managed to win the game. I think we can draw a line under it and move on.""
It is not the first disciplinary issue Ten Hag has had to confront this season.
He blocked Alejandro Garnacho, who replaced Rashford in the starting line-up at Wolves, from playing during United's pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia when he was late for team meetings.
Most famously, he axed Cristiano Ronaldo when he refused to come on as a substitute against Tottenham in October, triggering the chain of events that ended on Friday when the Portuguese forward signed a lucrative contract with Saudi Arabian side Al Nassr.
""Don't talk about the past. Let's talk about the future,"" Ten Hag said on Saturday when asked about Ronaldo's move.
Rashford has now scored 11 goals for United in all competitions this season. He has scored in three successive games for the first time since November 2019.
""I think I am in a good place,"" the England star told BT Sport.
""It's difficult to come back from the World Cup. Emotion-wise everyone is at different levels but it has been important for us to stick together and help each other through a difficult moment for the lads that didn't win the World Cup.""
Rashford's efforts have helped United record five wins in a row for the first time since April 2021 and edge into the top four.
""We make a good step today,"" said Ten Hag. ""It is the first time we are in top four, but it means nothing. 
""We have to win every game if we want to try and win something. That is our aim. It depends on hard work from everyone."""	/sport/football/64135191
sports	Tennis in 2023: What can Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic & Emma Raducanu expect?	"The new tennis season starts this week with the inaugural United Cup in Australia.
mixed team event, running from 29 December to 8 January, will feature many of the world's top players and offer a chance to gauge their form before the opening Grand Slam of the year - the Australian Open - starts on 16 January.
Before the first ball of the season is hit, we consider what the big tennis questions for 2023 might be and ask BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller for his verdict. 
Rafael Nadal won two Grand Slam titles in 2022, taking his tally to a men's record 22 major singles trophies.
It was something of a resurgence for the 36-year-old - he had not won back-to-back Grand Slams for 12 years - and his 14th French Open title came despite having ""no feeling"" in his left foot as he was having multiple injections to numb chronic foot pain.
After the victory in Paris he had a nerve-burning treatment so that he could avoid further jabs and he went on to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals before withdrawing with an abdominal injury.
He shed tears in September when he played alongside Roger Federer as the Swiss called time on his career and while Nadal's mind clearly wants to continue playing tennis at the highest level, it seems that his body is becoming increasingly reluctant and it may not be too long before he follows his great rival into retirement.
Nadal will play at the United Cup so we should get an early clue as to what his physical condition looks like before he defends his Australian Open title.
Russell Fuller's verdict: Not entirely, I suspect, but Nadal proved last year he can still win Grand Slams in between rest periods. And he is a past master at getting himself fit for the second week at Roland Garros. 
A year ago Novak Djokovic was deported from Australia before he could begin the defence of his title after his visa was cancelled in a row over his Covid-19 vaccine status.
He was automatically banned from entering the country for three years but that has been overturned and the former world number one will now return to Melbourne seeking a record-extending 10th title.
ga dominated the headlines in the build-up last year, splitting public opinion, and it is unclear what kind of reception the Serb will get when he walks out on court. Tournament director Craig Tiley said last month he expected the crowd to be ""fair"".
Russell Fuller's verdict: My hunch is quite a good one. I'm sure there will be some anger on radio phone-ins as he arrives in the country, and a few larrikins in the stands come the Australian Open, but he is a nine-time champion who can win those fans over.
ree out of the four men's major titles were won by Nadal and Djokovic in 2022, continuing a pattern of recent years - the pair have won 15 of the past 18 Grand Slam titles. 
But the past three editions of the US Open have been won by different players, with Dominic Thiem, Daniil Medvedev and Carlos Alcaraz winning their maiden Grand Slam titles in New York.
Nadal has question marks over his fitness, Djokovic is short of match practice after his vaccination status ruled him out of various events in 2022 and Federer has retired, which may open the door for some new champions.
Denmark's Holger Rune put himself firmly in the conversation by coming from behind to beat Djokovic in the final of the prestigious Paris Masters final in November and the 19-year-old has set his eyes on more. 
""I know what I want,"" he said. ""I want to win Slams. I won an ATP 250, reached an ATP 500 final and won a Masters 1,000. It's time for a Slam win.""
Norwegian 23-year-old Casper Ruud, runner-up at the French and US Opens in 2022, will be hoping to go one better, while Australian Nick Kyrgios, 27, will be aiming to carry on the momentum he built with a Wimbledon final appearance and a US Open quarter-final. 
In the women's game, Tunisia's Ons Jabeur will be keen to take one of the big prizes after back-to-back finals in the last two Grand Slams of last season. 
Russell Fuller's verdict: Ons Jabeur and Casper Ruud now have Grand Slam final experience and a very high seeding and I don't see any reason why they can't take the final step. And, more speculatively, could China's Zheng Qinwen or even 17-year-old Czech Linda Fruhvirtova go the distance?
Wimbledon organisers were fined for their decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players from the grass-court Grand Slam this year because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
re is no end in sight to the war so Wimbledon is likely to face a sensitive decision in the coming months about whether to continue to ban the players.
men's ATP Tour and women's WTA Tour also stripped Wimbledon of ranking points in response to the ban and while last year players were still attracted to the event, it could become less appealing to them if there are no points once again.
Russell Fuller's verdict: The All England Club will be extremely anxious to avoid a repeat of last year and return the championships to full strength. But it will still be very difficult for them to ignore any strong governmental direction (whether public or otherwise) to ban Russian players.
Emma Raducanu's first full year on the tour was frequently interrupted by injuries and coaching changes, with the 20-year-old Briton unable to build on her stunning 2021 US Open success with more titles. 
In a bid to make herself less prone to injury, she has been working with physical trainer Jez Green, who played a key role in Andy Murray's physical development early in his career.
""My biggest goal in 2023 is to be more injury free,"" she told lifestyle magazine SheerLuxe earlier this month. 
""This year, the demands of the tour, going from having no training or stamina to being thrown into competing at the top level, my body has struggled.
""So, I'll be working hard to keep my body in good shape and improving. If you want a 'resolution' it's probably to be consistent. Put in the work, day in, day out.""
Russell Fuller's verdict: The omens are more encouraging. Despite the wrist injury she took into pre-season, Raducanu has had a much better training block. She avoided Covid this year, and looks set to share Jez Green with Dominic Thiem on tour next year.
r marked a breakthrough season for 21-year-old Briton Jack Draper, who rose to a career-high world number 41 from 265 at the start of the year. 
He reached the Eastbourne semi-finals and an ATP 1,000 quarter-final in Canada, was well as the Next Gen Finals, which are for the Tour's best players aged 21 and under.
Victories against top-10 players Stefanos Tsitsipas and Felix Auger-Aliassime, as well as former world number three Dominic Thiem, showed he can compete at the highest level and makes him one to watch in 2023.
Russell Fuller's verdict: Finishing the year in the top 20 would be fantastic, and not implausible. He starts the year at 42 - trying to halve your ranking in a season is always a good target for aspiring young players.
It's not entirely impossible.
Since a farewell ceremony at the US Open in September following the 41-year-old's announcement she was ""evolving away"" from tennis, the American 23-time Grand Slam singles champion has maintained that she is ""not retired"".
And last month she posted a photo of a tennis racquet in plastic wrapping with the words ""I'm a little bored"".
Surely, she couldn't?
Russell Fuller's verdict: No. But I am sure she will think about it in the spring with Wimbledon and the US Open fast approaching."	/sport/tennis/63985689

business	Energy bills: Tens of thousands of firms 'face collapse' without help	"f thousands of businesses are at risk of going under without government support because of soaring energy bills, according to insolvency experts.
Red Flag Alert, which monitors the financial health of firms, told the BBC previously profitable companies are experiencing significant losses.
Among those that survive, many will be forced to make workers redundant, the consultancy said.
Firms are waiting to hear if they will get help with their energy bills.
On Thursday the government, led by new Prime Minister Liz Truss, is expected to announce significant financial support for households facing an 80% rise in the energy price cap in October.
Businesses are not covered by the cap, however, and Red Flag is warning that more than 75,000 larger firms that are high energy users are at risk of insolvency or are likely to lay off staff without government support. 
government's plan is expected to include some relief for businesses - but details are not yet known.
According to Red Flag, many firms will face a choice between paying wages or paying energy bills.
""Businesses can't absorb these costs and they're going to be forced very quickly into a decision about headcount or being able to pay energy bills,"" said chief economist Nicola Headlam. ""That's going to be the reality and it's coming down the track very quickly.""
According to Red Flag Alert, there are 355,000 companies with a turnover higher than £1m that are designated as high energy users - industries such as steel, glass, concrete, and paper production. Of those, the company estimates 75,972 are at risk of insolvency, and they estimate 26,720 of them could fail because of energy costs. That is in addition to the 26,000 insolvencies they had already predicted this year.
""That is a colossal number of people whose businesses will fail, without a large-scale support package from the government"", said Ms Headlam. ""That's more than during the pandemic, and more than in any other recession.
""A business turning over a million pounds two years ago would have spent around 8% of that on energy costs and made profits of around £90,000.
""If the cost of energy doubles to 16%, that instantly wipes out profitability, and they're straight into a scenario where it threatens the viability of the business within a year.""
Beyond the large, energy-intensive companies, smaller companies with turnover under £1m, were also at risk of failure, Red Flag Alert said. It highlighted the hospitality sector where firms face a triple threat of increasing energy bills, higher supply and staffing costs, and a fall-off in consumer spending, squeezed by inflation.
rtainly the case for James Greenhalgh, who runs Flamingos Coffee House in Leeds, and a bar in the city too. The combined energy bill for both is due to leap from £1,500 to around £10,000 from the beginning of October. 
""That's more expensive than our wage bill. That's just catastrophic,"" said Mr Greenhalgh.
""It's an extinction event for many businesses like mine,"" said Mr Greenhalgh.
""I've been speaking to so many similar businesses in Leeds and everyone's in the same situation - considering whether to try and battle through, mothball sites over the winter and hope things improve, or whether it's game over.""
""The only thing I can do is wait to see what help the government will give. I can't innovate out of it. I can't put prices up because our customers don't have the money.""
Without rapid government help, Mr Greenhalgh said he would have to close one of his sites, and make staff redundant.
""If the government had stepped in two months ago, it would have made a much bigger difference. The delays this summer have slammed customer confidence"", he added.
Red Flag Alert calculates businesses overall will need £100bn a year in support to tackle the rise in energy bills. 
While hospitality is not included in that figure, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, restaurateur Martin Williams warned that thousands of smaller firms in the industry were also at risk.
f the Gaucho steakhouse chain urged the government to consider energy bills help, as well as VAT cuts and business rates reform.
""There needs to be some confidence and that can only come from government support by the prime minister and the chancellor,"" he said.
However the government is already under pressure over how it will finance a promised package of support for households, while sticking to promises to cut taxes.
Ms Truss is understood to be planning to borrow up to £100bn to to limit the expected sharp rise in energy bills for households and firms. 
Right now, the annual energy bill for a typical household is £1,971. From 1 October, however, that is due to rise 80% - to £3,549. It is understood that the plans will see a typical household energy bill rise to £2,500 instead - about £1,000 less than expected, but still about £500 more than at present.
As well as households, businesses are also expected to receive some help. Many firms are currently facing even sharper rises than households and many fixed-rate deals for business expire this October, exposing thousands of firms to full costs that could rise by four or five times or more.
In her victory speech, Ms Truss pledged to ""deliver on the energy crisis""."	/news/business-62813782
entertainment	House of the Dragon: HBO defends Game of Thrones spin-off's dark scenes	"HBO has defended the latest episode of its Game of Thrones spin-off after some viewers complained that it was too dark to see what was happening on screen.
f House of the Dragon was released on Monday, with some scenes set during the night.
But a number of fans complained or joked about how poor lighting meant they could not see what was going on.
In response, broadcaster HBO Max said: ""The dimmed lighting of this scene was an intentional creative decision.""
A significant number of viewers tweeted about the darkness, and the network replied to several of them with the same message.
One viewer said: ""You've got to watch House of the Dragon at night in the dark with blackout curtains drawn tight, because if you try to watch while the sun is out you cant see a damn thing.""
""This episode of House of the Dragon is so dark it's unwatchable,"" tweeted another. ""Might as well just turn off my screen and listen to it at this point.""
Other fans agreed. ""It's amazing with the budgets Game of Thrones and House of the Dragons have, they can't produce better lighting for the dark scenes,"" one wrote. ""Might as well drive with sunglasses on at night.""
""The night-time visuals in House of the Dragon are simply too dark,"" concluded another. ""These scenes would be so epic if I could actually see what was happening.""
But others defended the show, with one writing: ""If you couldn't see the full moon scenes in House of the Dragon then your TV contrast sucks. I loved it, it was beautifully shot.""
Another said: ""Half the world is mad about House of Dragon being so dark. Have y'all never had an intense romantic convo on the beach at night? Adjust your settings if you can't see.""
Some made light of the backlash, with podcast host Jesse David Fox tweeting: ""I was gonna tweet that last night's House of the Dragons was too dark but then I realised my TV was off and I actually hadn't started watching yet.""
Miguel Sapochnik, who directed the latest episode, previously defended the darkness of a Game of Thrones episode, The Long Night, during an interview with the IndieWire Filmmaker Toolkit podcast in 2019.
""Everybody who was making it thought about it a lot, bought hook line and sinker into the idea that it was about embracing the darkness, and made that decision,"" he said.
""I can't control what people watch it on. I've never made anything to be seen on an iPhone. Everything I've made, I've made to be in the largest format possible, to be experienced with people. 
""And The Long Night is made to be watched in a cinema with as many people as you can possibly stick in there, and I don't have a solution for the problem that arose out of it.""
But like Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon was not released in cinemas. It was launched on TV and streaming earlier this year and received mixed reviews from critics, with the Guardian describing it as ""a roaring success"" but the Wrap saying it ""pales in comparison"" to its predecessor.
It is far from the first show to annoy its own viewers with scenes which are too dark. 
BBC One drama The Luminaries, based on Eleanor Catton's Booker-winning novel, was criticised in 2020 for its darkly lit scenes.
w's director said the dim lighting was deliberate as it added a ""sense of mystery and intrigue""."	/news/entertainment-arts-63130241
technology	UK watchdog warns of emotion-analysis tech risks	"Companies should not use immature biometric technologies to analyse emotion, the Information Commissioner's Office has warned.
ICO is worried organisations are making critical decisions about people without appreciating there is no scientific evidence the tech works.
And it could cause ""systemic bias, inaccuracy and even discrimination"".
Deputy commissioner Stephen Bonner told BBC News the worst tech was little better than a fortune-telling fish.
movements of the translucent red plastic fish, often found inside Christmas crackers, when placed in the palm of the hand, supposedly predict the future.
Mr Bonner also compared the fantastic claims made for some biometric technologies to the magic sorting hat from the Harry Potter books.
Biometric information is based on physical and behavioural characteristics, such as facial movements or heartbeats.
ICO was not against properly used biometrics, Mr Bonner told the BBC News Tech Tent Podcast, stressing some technologies - such as face and fingerprint scans to access smartphones - could protect people's data very effectively.
But scientists told the ICO there was no robust link between people's inner emotions and intent and the expression on their face or sweat on their skin.
As an example, Mr Bonner suggested recruitment technology that analysed a three-minute video and claimed to be able to tell ""if this person will be a brilliant fit in your team"".
Post-doctoral researchers at Cambridge University recently raised similar concerns about some of the claims made for artificial-intelligence image-analysis systems used to assess a job candidate's personality.
Mr Bonner said the ICO was warning companies: ""If you go and buy this technology without any evidence that it's actually working and then there's harm for individuals, we're going to step in.""
And it wanted to protect the reputation of legitimate biometric applications from association with ineffective technologies."	/news/technology-63402344
health	New Year Honours: Eugene Milne and Lucy Bronze made MBEs	"A former health chief who led Newcastle's coronavirus response and one of the North East's victorious Lionesses have been appointed MBEs.
Prof Eugene Milne and footballer Lucy Bronze, who is from Berwick and played for Sunderland, were named in the King's first New Year Honours list.
He said the honour was a ""lovely fillip"", while Bronze said the first person she told was her grandma.
North Tyneside Mayor Norma Redfearn was also recognised and been made a dame.
Prof Milne said: ""Everyone in public health knows that it is a team activity, and I have been blessed with terrific colleagues over the years. I would not be here without them.""
Bronze, 31, was part of the squad which won Euro 2022 at Wembley in the summer and said: ""To be recognised for everything I've done throughout my career was a little bit surreal. It's just something so different to football and something harder to compute.
""An MBE is obviously a huge honour and very special. The first person I told was my grandma.
""My grandma probably doesn't understand many of the awards I've won in football but she adored the Queen, so I thought 'this (MBE) is going to be her special thing'.""
As the city's director of public health, Prof Milne had become a ""leading voice"" in the region's response to the pandemic, Newcastle City Council said.
He moved to Newcastle to study medicine in 1979 and was director of public health for eight years before retiring in April.
Also honoured from Newcastle University were:
Right-back Bronze had four years at Sunderland before moving to Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City and now Barcelona, and has 100 caps for England.
England captain Leah Williamson has been made an OBE and teammates Beth Mead and Ellen White become MBEs after they won England's first major football trophy since the men's 1966 World Cup.
Asked why not all the Lionesses were included, Sir Hugh Robertson, chairman of the honours sports committee, said there was a danger of ""carpet bombing the entire squad because then you get people who've done five minutes on the pitch and get an award"".
""So what we've tried to do is stick to the principle of the honours system which is to recognise excellence and to recognise extraordinary contributions,"" he said.

Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE)
Officers of the Order of the British Empire (OBE)
Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE)

sports	Commonwealth Games: Adam Peaty wins first 50m Commonwealth title	"Adam Peaty says he has his ""spark"" back after powering to a first Commonwealth 50m breaststroke title in what he says is his final race at the Games.
Having missed out on a 100m medal on Sunday as he recovers from a broken foot, the English swimmer had said he was ""not bothered"" about adding the shorter title to his collection.
r to be the case as he thrashed the water in celebration.
""I had two options this morning - I either fight or don't fight,"" he said.
""Everyone who knows me, knows I fight.""
Peaty certainly looked ready to fight as he entered the Sandwell Aquatics Centre, beating his chest twice before raising his hand to acknowledge the goosebump-inducing noise from the crowd.
27-year-old jumped up and down behind his block, before eventually the shouts of ""come on Peaty"" subsided and silence fell.
Initially, after touching first in 26.76 seconds, Peaty only gave an understated nod of his head.
Before the final, he had said ""you back a lion into a corner, they're going to bite"". He looked every bit the king of the pool as his celebrations sprang to life and he climbed on the lane rope to roar at the crowd.
It was a fairly comfortable victory in the end too. Australian silver medallist Sam Williamson was 0.21 seconds back, with Scotland's Ross Murdoch - who secretly retired in December before returning to swimming - taking bronze in 27.32 seconds.
Peaty said after his 100m that he had lost his spark in the last two years and needed to take a long break before turning his attention to a third Olympic title at the 2024 Games.
rowd's response to his victory may go some way to helping him fall back in love with the sport and he repaid their applause by throwing his cap and goggles into the stands.
""That means so much to me, because what I have been through the last five years,"" Peaty said.
""I lost my spark towards the beginning of the week and I have it back now. A lot of people have got to understand that I reached the bottom of the bottom yesterday and to bring myself up with the crowd in my own mind and that is the result.""
Later, as he received his medal on the podium and lapped up the adoration of the Sandwell crowd, that spark had returned to his eyes and the smile to his face.
Peaty said he ""can retire now"" after completing his collection of Commonwealth titles, but added that he was ""looking forward to resetting"" and training over the winter.
""I am so glad I got that loss earlier in the week because these wins feel so much more alive and so much better,"" he concluded.
Peaty also apologised in his post-race interview for his comments made after missing out on a medal in the 50m breaststroke final - saying he was ""not bothered"".
BBC pundits had described his reaction as ""disrespectful"".
He told BBC Sport: ""I want to be accountable for that. It came across very wrong. I did address it and I'm sorry to anyone who misunderstood that. A lot of emotions yesterday. I'd reached the bottom of the bottom yesterday.
Peaty, had earlier clarified his comments on Twitter,external-link writing: ""Sometimes in the heat of the moment, my emotions better me... These championships mean a lot to me, being a home Games.""
Peaty's was not the first English gold on the penultimate night of swimming in Birmingham - as earlier on, Brodie Williams passed compatriot Luke Greenbank on the last length of the 200m backstroke to take the title.
Greenbank had his head in his hands as Williams celebrated, but the pair then embraced as the home crowd cheered.
Laura Stephens brought more joy for the hosts with 200m butterfly silver in the next race and James Guy continued the rush of medals for England with joint silver in a thrilling 100m butterfly final.
ger Josh Liendo - the first black Canadian swimmer to win world short course gold in 2021 - took gold in in 51.24 seconds, ahead of 200m bronze medallist Guy and Australia's Matthew Temple, with South African Chad le Clos fourth.
England's James Hollis won bronze in the 100m butterfly S10, in which Australia's Col Pearse won gold, and the hosts' quartet of Lauren Cox, James Wilby, Guy and Freya Anderson ended the night with a mixed 4x100m medley bronze.
Australia's Bradley Woodward took men's 200m backstroke silver and South African Pieter Coetze claimed bronze.
In the women's 200m butterfly, Australia's Elizabeth Dekkers claimed gold in two minutes 7.26 seconds - 0.64 seconds ahead of Stephens - and compatriot Brianna Throssell took bronze.
Ben Proud - champion in the 50m butterfly - qualified fastest for the men's 50m freestyle final in 21.63 seconds, with Lewis Burras also qualifying.
Wales' Medi Harris, Northern Ireland's Danielle Hill and England's Cox reached the 50m backstroke final.
In the 100m freestyle, Emma McKeon became the joint most-decorated Commonwealth athlete of all time alongside South Africa's Le Clos as a bronze took her medal tally to 18.
Fellow Australian Mollie O'Callaghan won that race and Shayna Jack took silver.
Lara van Niekerk claimed a comfortable win in the women's 100m breaststroke with fellow South African Tatjana Schoenmaker taking silver and Australia's Chelsea Hodges bronze.

Jasmine Greenwood won the 200m individual medley SM10 and for the fifth time in the Games, they claimed all three medals in a swimming event.
Ariarne Titmus smashed the Commonwealth Games record of eight minutes 18.11 seconds in the 800m freestyle, winning in 8:13.59, with fellow Australians Kiah Melverton and Lani Pallister were second and third respectively.

business	Ryanair boss hits out at airports: 'They had one job'	"A Ryanair boss has criticised airports for not recruiting enough staff to cater for the rebound in travellers, saying they had ""had one job to do to"".
Neil Sorahan, chief financial officer, said ""various governments"" and airports needed to be held to account for ""not staffing up appropriately"".
His comments come as staff shortages at airports have led to major disruption and cancellations in recent months.
Airports said they had been recruiting security staff since late last year. 
A spokesperson for the Airport Operators Association (AOA), which represents most UK airports ranging from Heathrow to Edinburgh, said: ""The vast majority of passengers across the UK are now getting away on their holidays with no or minimal disruption.""
kesperson added that it was ""essential"" the industry worked together to fill the remaining vacancies, including for airline ground handling staff. 
Mr Sorahan, who said Ryanair was having a ""phenomenal"" summer as the airline posted profits of €170m (£145m) for the three months to the end of June, told the BBC's Today programme the ""biggest issue"" the company had faced was ""air traffic control disruptions all across Europe"".
""You have to hold ANSPs [air navigation service providers] and various governments to account in relation to not staffing up appropriately for that,"" he said.
""Equally the airports themselves, they had one job to do to and that was to make sure they have sufficient handlers and security staff. They had the schedules months in advance.
""We managed to staff up for 73 additional aircrafts well in advance and it's incumbent on the airports to get their planning better next year.""
After shedding thousands of jobs during the pandemic, the travel industry has struggled to recruit, train and security-check new staff quickly enough to keep up with resurgent demand.
Airlines have been blamed for taking more bookings than they can manage, while airports have also been criticised for not being able to cater for more flights.
Meanwhile, aviation industry leaders have argued the government could have done more to support the sector during the pandemic.
ustry has also been threatened by strike action, with many staff demanding pay rises to cope with the rising cost of living.
Ryanair has faced battles with unions after it cut salaries during the pandemic, but said it had agreed deals with more than 80% of its pilots and about 70% of cabin crews.
""We hope to conclude agreements with the small remaining balance in the near future,"" the group said.
Mr Sorahan told the BBC that any strike action that had taken place had a ""minimal impact"" on services.
Despite currently facing industrial disputes in France, Belgium and Spain over pay and conditions, Ryanair has suffered the least disruption and cancellations of major European carriers in recent months. 
In the first six months of 2022, Ryanair cancelled 0.3% of flights, compared with British Airways' total of 3.5%, and EasyJet's 2.8%, according to air travel consultancy OAG. 
Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary previously told the BBC that the company's ""strong balance sheet"" going into the pandemic enabled it to keep staff on, albeit on reduced pay, and maintain training at the height of Covid so they were able to ramp up operations when restrictions were lifted.
Mr Sorahan said Ryanair was ""fully staffed"" and operating more than 3,000 flights a day as many people venture on their first summer holiday since pandemic restrictions were lifted.
Ryanair said it remained ""confident that we can operate almost 100% of our scheduled flights, while minimising delays and disruptions for our guests and their families"".
rline said its passenger numbers had rebounded to 45.5 million - 9% higher than before the Covid pandemic - but its first quarter profits were still short of pre-Covid levels.
mpany said its fuel costs had soared by 560% to €1bn and added the Ukraine war had ""badly damaged"" Easter bookings and fares.
Mr O'Leary said in a statement on the company's results that unpredictability around fuel prices, the risk of new Covid variants and the war in Ukraine meant the company was unable to forecast a profit for the full financial year.
""While we remain hopeful that the high rate of vaccinations in Europe will allow the airline and tourism industry to fully recover and finally put Covid behind us, we cannot ignore the risk of new Covid variants in autumn 2022. Our experience... shows how fragile the travel market remains,"" he said.

politics	Rishi Sunak backtracks on £10 missed NHS appointment fines	"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has scrapped a Tory leadership campaign pledge he made to fine patients in England £10 if they miss GP or hospital appointments. 
He made the pledge during this summer's leadership contest against Liz Truss. 
Mr Sunak had argued it was ""not right"" some patients were failing to turn up, taking slots from those in need. 
But a No 10 spokeswoman said that, after ""listening to GPs"", the government decided it was ""not the right time"" for the policy. 
She added that Mr Sunak wanted to deliver ""a stronger NHS and the sentiment remains that people should not be missing their appointments and taking up NHS time"".
Critics of the proposal included doctors' union the British Medical Association (BMA), which said it would ""make matters worse"" and threaten the NHS's principle of free care at the point of need.
BMA welcomed the decision to scrap the plan and said it ""cannot be brought back to the table later down the line"".
It said ""punishing"" patients was not the answer to the many reasons people miss appointments, and the policy would ""only deter the most vulnerable from seeking the help they need, worsen health inequalities, and ultimately undermine the essential trust between doctor and patient"".
Instead, the BMA said the government must work to improve pay and other conditions to ensure the NHS has safe levels of staff.
Reflecting a similar view, the Royal College of GPs said the plans would have disadvantaged some of the NHS's most vulnerable patients.
Chairman of the college Prof Martin Marshall said the move would ""simply have been tinkering at the edges given the scale of the crisis facing GPs and our teams"".
Outlining the policy in July, Mr Sunak said patients would be given the ""benefit of the doubt"" the first time they missed an appointment without providing sufficient notice, but further absences would incur a £10 charge.
Fines would also be waived in exceptional circumstances, such as if a patient had an emergency. 
He explained the system would be ""temporary"" as backlogs caused by the pandemic were cleared.
But he gave few details of the how the system would work, writing in the Sunday Telegraph: ""If we have people who are now showing up and taking those slots away from people who need [them], that's not right.
""I'm all for a healthcare system that's free at the point of use, but not one that's free at the point of misuse.""
Asked if other pledges on the NHS made during the summer leadership campaign still stood, she said Mr Sunak's ""initial ideas"" over summer would be discussed with cabinet ministers and any announcements would be ""set out in due course"". 
Mr Sunak had also pledged to eliminate one-year waiting times by September 2024, and get the number of people waiting for non-urgent treatment in England falling by next year. 
He pledged to do this by boosting the number of ""diagnostic hubs"" outside hospitals, including by repurposing empty High Street shops. He also pledged to reform dentists' NHS contract, and ring fence the annual £3bn NHS dentistry budget.

politics	Philip Hammond: Raise taxes for all to improve services	"All earners in the UK, not just the wealthiest, will need to pay higher tax if public services like the NHS are to improve, an ex-chancellor has warned.
Lord Philip Hammond told the BBC that the next few months could be ""incredibly difficult"" for many people.
It came after Michael Gove refused to confirm whether benefits would rise with the soaring cost of living.
Lord Hammond questioned how more support for the vulnerable would be paid for by the current government.
former chancellor, who served under Theresa May, said that Rishi Sunak now faces a ""huge challenge"" trying to balance the government's books and boost the economy at the same time.
He told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg programme that stricter rules on borrowing would need to apply in the wake of the mini-budget.
""Borrowing is no longer on the table after the market tantrum... And that applies to a Labour government wanting to offer more public spending, just as it applies to a Tory government wanting to borrow to cut taxes,"" he said.
und fell to a record low against the dollar and government borrowing costs rose in the wake of then-chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget, where he announced major tax cuts without detailing how they would be paid for.
In Rishi Sunak's first speech as prime minister, he said he would ""fix"" the mistakes made during his predecessor's time in office.
Jeremy Hunt, who replaced Mr Kwarteng as chancellor, needs to find billions of pounds of savings to keep the UK's debt under control, although the cost of government borrowing has since fallen back.
Philip Hammond said that he would be ""very surprised"", however, if the government did not decide to increase benefits in line with the soaring cost of living.
Speaking on the BBC programme, Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove refused to commit to the policy, despite insisting that the prime minister was ""locked on"" to the needs of the most vulnerable.
In response, Lord Hammond also questioned comments by Michael Gove made about targeted support.
""I heard Michael Gove talking about targeted support for all sorts of people but I didn't hear him say how it will be paid for.""
He added that Rishi Sunak would need to prioritise plans to boost the economy now that Liz Truss's strategy was ""dead in the water"".
""They're going to have to come up with a growth plan,"" he said.
""Without growth we're not going to be able to solve the problems our public services are facing and solve this conundrum that people don't want to pay higher taxes but they do want better public services - the only way you can resolve that is higher growth.""
He added: ""Of course you can tax wealthy people a bit more but the reality of the fiscal challenge we face is that if we want public services not just to be maintained but to be improved… Everybody including ordinary earners are going to have to pay more tax.""
Former governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, also recently warned that the UK faces ""significantly higher taxes"" to fund public spending as the government attempts to stabilise the economy.
ral bank said in September that the UK could already be in recession, partly caused by soaring food and energy costs placing a squeeze on household budgets.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will set out his tax and spending plans for the UK on 17 November, two weeks later than originally expected.
With Mr Sunak promising stronger public services, some predict the pair will favour new taxes rather than spending cuts, which could include increasing windfall taxes on energy companies, for example."	/news/business-63446173
technology	Samsung did not break rules over woman running at 2am advert	"A Samsung ad criticised for showing a woman running alone at 02:00 has been cleared by the advertising watchdog.
People complained that the smart watch campaign was irresponsible for encouraging unsafe behaviour.
But the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the ads ""did not encourage an unsafe practice and were not irresponsible"".
Women's Running magazine editor Esther Newman said the ruling ""makes people think there's nothing to worry about"".
Samsung previously apologised for how the 'Night Owls' ad might have been received when it launched in April.
It showed a young woman running alone in London at night with headphones in to promote the Galaxy Watch and Buds. 
racted 27 complaints to the ASA from viewers who mentioned the number of recent high-profile cases where women had been attacked in similar circumstances.
Woman's running groups and campaigners also told Radio 1 Newsbeat the ad was ""unrealistic"".
However, the ASA has since reviewed the ad and found it did not breach advertising rules - meaning no further action will be taken.
""We considered that running alone at night, of itself, was not likely to result in harm or injury,"" the watchdog said. 
""Whilst we acknowledged that an attack could happen, that was outside of a person's control and it could also happen in other, everyday scenarios and at all times of the day or night.""
Reclaim These Streets previously described the campaign as ""tone deaf"" in light of the death of 23-year-old Irish teacher Ashling Murphy, who was killed after she went for a run in January.
Reacting to the ASA ruling, Jamie Klingler, from the women's safety group, said they never thought the ad was illegal but was more ""distasteful"".
""The ad should not have been made and should have taken into consideration the reality that women face while trying to exercise in this country,"" she said.
""I would absolutely love to not have a night time curfew with my exercise. But the fact of the matter is, that's not available to me because of the epidemic of violence against women."" 
Esther said she ""completely understands"" the ASA's ruling that it is not false advertising but the issue of women's safety remains, which makes ""complaints almost laughable"".
""We know there are a lot of concerns out there that a lot of women feel unsafe no matter what time they go for a run,"" she said.
According to recent figures from the Office for National Statistics, half of all women have felt unsafe at some point walking alone in the dark.
Esther said a conversation with advertising companies should happen to discuss woman's safety and running as she believes it is a much wider issue. 
Samsung said it was ""fully co-operative"" with the ASA's investigation into the 'Night Owls' campaign.
giant previously told Radio 1 Newsbeat it never intended to ""be insensitive to ongoing conversations around women's safety"".

business	Government borrowing costs rise after PM's U-turn	"Government borrowing costs rose on Friday afternoon after the prime minister announced another U-turn on the mini-budget.
und, which initially held firm earlier on Friday, also lost ground.
moves came as Liz Truss sacked her chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, and said a rise in corporation tax would now go ahead.
However, some economists warned that the latest developments might not be enough to restore the UK's credibility.
""It's unlikely that the removal of Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor and the new plans to cancel the cancellation of the rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25% from next April will be enough on their own to regain the full confidence of the financial markets,"" said Paul Dales, Chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
He also pointed out that despite another U-turn on the 45p tax cut, there are still unfunded tax cuts of about £25bn left over from the mini-budget - down from £45bn originally.
f government borrowing rose across a range of bonds traded on the financial markets following the announcement. 
rest rate - or yield - on bonds due to be repaid in 30 years' time climbed to 4.85%. 
5.17% on 28 September in the aftermath of the mini-budget when Mr Kwarteng set out one of the biggest tax cuts packages seen in decades but did not explain how they would be funded.
Meanwhile, the yield on bonds due to be repaid in five years' time, which underpins the cost of new five-year fixed rate mortgages, jumped to 4.35%.
und - which had jumped on Thursday as speculation mounted about a possible U-turn - also sank by more than 1% to just under $1.12 on Friday before clawing back some losses.
Prime Minister Liz Truss admitted the government's mini-budget had gone ""faster and further"" than many expected. 
""We need to act now to reassure the markets of our fiscal discipline,"" she said.
government also announced that Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign and health secretary, will succeed Mr Kwarteng. He will be the UK's fourth chancellor so far this year and will face big challenges with prices soaring and hikes in interest rates.
Speaking to the BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam, leading economist Mohamed El-Arian said that the events seen in the UK over the last few weeks in particular were ""unthinkable"".
""There are already scars. If you had to refinance your mortgage, if you're looking to buy a house - you've been hit,"" he said of the recent market turmoil.
He said Mr Hunt ""needs more measures, he needs to cover more of the unfunded tax cuts that were introduced… most of the damage is recoverable but it needs action and time"".
Investec economist Ellie Henderson described markets as ""dizzy"" over the series of policy reversals and changes.
""Markets seem unconvinced that today's announcement was enough to fully restore confidence in the UK government,"" she said.
government had already U-turned on its plan to scrap the top rate of income tax for people earning £150,000 a year or more. Reducing the tax rate for top earners would have cost £2bn. 
Moving ahead with the increase in corporation tax should add an estimated £18bn a year in tax revenue to the government's coffers.
rime minister added that ""spending will grow less rapidly than previously planned"". 
reasury also confirmed that the incoming chancellor would still deliver the government's ""economic plan"" on 31 October, which will set out how the remaining tax cuts will be funded, and how debts will be reduced.
On Friday, an emergency bond-buying scheme set up by the Bank of England to restore calm in the financial markets following the previous mini-budget will also come to an end. 
government raises money it needs for spending by selling bonds - a form of debt that is paid back plus interest in anywhere between five and 30 years.
Pension funds invest in bonds because they provide a low but usually reliable return over a long period of time.
However, the sharp fall in their value after the mini-budget forced pension funds to sell bonds, threatening to create a ""downward spiral"" in their prices as more were offloaded, which left some funds close to collapse.
rked an emergency intervention by the Bank of England, which has stepped in to buy £19.3bn worth of government bonds.
re has been strong speculation that the Bank will extend the scheme past the Friday deadline.
But on Tuesday, the Bank's governor Andrew Bailey dashed those hopes, telling pension funds: ""You've got three days left now and you've got to sort it out.""
Bethany Payne, global bonds fund manager at Janus Henderson, told the BBC it was not clear whether pension funds have done enough to strengthen their finances.
""The risk is that we don't know how pension funds have used this window of time and whether they have used it effectively by raising cash and doing everything they need to,"" she said.
""So the true test of the market will be this afternoon and Monday morning to see whether they have done enough."""	/news/business-63243918

technology	AI rapper FN Meka dropped by Capitol over racial stereotyping	"A record label has cut ties with an AI rapper after criticism it contained racial stereotypes, including repeated use of the N-word.
FN Meka is an artificial intelligence musician given the appearance of a black male cyborg.
But Capitol Music Group (CMG) faced a backlash for signing the rapper.
In a statement announcing they had severed ties, CMG offered its ""deepest apologies to the black community for our insensitivity"". 
FN Meka currently has more than 500,000 monthly Spotify subscribers and more than one billion views on its TikTok account.
Its Instagram account, which has more than 220,000 followers, has been made private.
FN Meka's songs are performed by an anonymous black man, according to Anthony Martini who is one of the cofounders of Factory New, a company responsible for the AI.
In an interview in 2021, he said a human voice ""performs the vocals, but we are working towards the ability to have a computer come up with and perform its own words - and even collaborate with other computers as co-writers"".
Before CMG dropped the rapper, black activist group Industry Blackout sent them an open letter saying FN Meka was ""offensive"" and ""a direct insult to the Black community and our culture"".
was ""an amalgamation of gross stereotypes, appropriative mannerisms that derive from Black artists, complete with slurs infused in lyrics"".
ut FN Meka had released a song with the rapper Gunna, who is currently awaiting trial in the US on criminal charges - with lyrics and social media posts being used as evidence.
""[He] is currently incarcerated for rapping the same type of lyrics this robot mimics. The difference is, your artificial rapper will not be subject to federal charges for such,"" they said.
""This digital effigy is a careless abomination and disrespectful to real people who face real consequences in real life.""
How AI is set to transform music
Industry Blackout demanded a public apology and for the AI rapper to be removed from all platforms.
want any profits generated to go to charities supporting black youth in the arts and to black musicians signed by CMG.
Speaking to the New York Times on Tuesday, before FN Meka was dropped, Mr Martini said he was anticipating it would happen due to ""clickbait headlines"". 
After being asked about an image of FN Meka being beaten by a police officer, he said: ""Some of the early content, now if you take it out of context, it obviously looks worse or different than it was intended.""
In their statement to Radio 1 Newsbeat, CMG also admitted to ""signing this project without asking enough questions"". 
""We thank those who have reached out to us with constructive feedback in the past couple of days - your input was invaluable as we came to the decision to end our association with the project,"" they added.

politics	Gordon Brown: Labour plan would make UK work for Scotland	"Labour's proposed reforms to the British political system would ""make the UK work for Scotland"", former prime minister Gordon Brown has said.
rty's plans include a binding veto for Holyrood over devolved issues and the power to join international arrangements like the Erasmus scheme.
Labour is also looking at replacing the House of Lords with an elected ""assembly of the nations and regions"".
Sir Keir Starmer said they would give the nations a ""louder, prouder voice"".
But the SNP described the package of measures as ""underwhelming"".
roposals were launched at an event in Leeds, followed by another event in Edinburgh on Monday afternoon.
ude plans to spread power across the nations of the UK as well as to English regions and local mayors, in what Sir Keir called the ""biggest ever transfer of power from Westminster to the British people"".
r - titled A New Britain - says Labour in government would offer ""economic, social and constitutional innovations that can make the UK work better for the Scottish people"".
would include a ""legally binding"" replacement for the Sewel convention, which states that Westminster would not normally legislate across devolved areas without the express consent of MSPs.
umber of times as Brexit legislation was passing through the Commons, and Labour said this ""disregarded the conventions which govern the exercise of power"".
r also proposes giving the Scottish Parliament some powers over foreign affairs, so that Scotland could sign up to international groups or agreements within devolved areas - such as the EU's Erasmus student exchange scheme.
And it says there would be a consultation on increasing Holyrood's borrowing powers.
Mr Brown told BBC Scotland: ""I want the United Kingdom to work for Scotland and Scottish people.
""I want to see a change in the United Kingdom that makes it more attractive for Scottish people to support it and I believe we have come forward with measures to do so.""
x-Labour leader also wants to see greater co-operation between governments to deal with shared problems such as pandemics and pollution.
Mr Brown said he wanted to see ""new job creating clusters"" developing in Scotland in areas such as precision medicine in Glasgow and the video games industry in Dundee.
former prime minister called for an overhaul of the Lords, which he said was ""the biggest second chamber outside of China.""
Other reforms could see a new Council of the United Kingdom, to be chaired by the prime minister, which would replace the existing Joint Ministerial Committee system as a way of bringing together ministers from the UK's devolved administrations.
Another recommendation is for Scotland to be represented on key UK national bodies, such as the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for Transport, Bank of England and the energy regulator Ofgem.
Scottish politics has become heavily polarised since the independence referendum in 2014, much to the Labour Party's disadvantage. 
minant force has been squeezed into third place - with ""yes"" voters typically backing the SNP and ""no"" voters tending more towards the Conservatives than Labour, in defence of the union. 
Gordon Brown is attempting to reset the debate with a package of UK-wide reforms that include some further devolution of power to Scotland and a bigger voice for Scotland in the UK and internationally. 
roposals will inevitably be considered too vague and weak by some independence supporters and as a misguided attempt to appease nationalists by some supporters of the union. 
Labour's hope is that instead of failing to please voters on either side of the debate, change within the UK could become a popular alternative to either independence or keeping the UK as it currently operates. 
Meanwhile, ""thousands"" of civil service jobs could be transferred from London to Scotland, with responsibility for job centres to be devolved to a local level.
ken together Mr Brown said the package ""could be more attractive than independence for Scotland"".
UK Supreme Court last month ruled that Holyrood cannot stage a second independence ballot without Westminster's go ahead.
SNP has said it could use the next general election as a single-issue campaign on independence, but Mr Brown said his party would be offering ""change within Britain rather than change by leaving Britain"".
He said: ""It may be that the SNP will have a one-line manifesto and want a one-issue general election. But we have done a huge amount of research on Scottish public opinion, and people want a better health service immediately, people want living standards improved immediately, people want jobs for young people immediately, people want better housing immediately, and people want change in the way we are suggesting immediately. 
""That is going to be the issue on which we fight - we are offering a plan for economic, social, political and constitutional reform, not a one issue election.""
But SNP deputy leader Keith Brown dismissed Labour's blueprint for change.
He said: ""After bigging up this report for months and months, this is yet another underwhelming constitutional reform plan from the Labour Party full of vague platitudes, empty promises, and what feels like the 10,000th time they have committed to reform the House of Lords.
""Ironically, a report which claims to be about strengthening devolution in many cases actually looks set to undermine it.""
He described Labour as a ""pro-Brexit party with a pro-Brexit leader"". 
Mr Brown added: ""Through independence, Scotland can build a genuine partnership of equals with other nations across these islands - not only protecting the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament, but allowing us to escape the failing, Brexit-based, UK economic model and build a fairer, more prosperous and sustainable Scotland."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63853652
entertainment	Nicki Minaj complains about Grammy Awards category change	"US rapper Nicki Minaj has hit out at the Grammy Awards for putting her hit single Super Freaky Girl in a category where it has ""less of a chance to win"".
She said the song had been moved to the pop category to clear the path ""to give newer artists things that they really don't deserve"" in the rap field.
rked a war of words on Twitter between Minaj and rising rapper Latto.
Super Freaky Girl has topped both the US pop and rap charts. Grammy organisers have not commented.
Speaking on Instagram, Minaj claimed there was ""an agenda"" against her in the music industry, and ""a concerted effort to give newer artists things that they really don't deserve over people who have been deserving for many years"".
She suggested she was losing out at the expense of artists who the gatekeepers ""want to shine"", and who ""these corporate giants can make the money off"".
""The people who control a lot of things behind the scenes, they have to elevate someone that they profit off. So they must move the goalposts for me all the time.""
Minaj added: ""Why is the goalpost only ever moved when it's Nicki? Well, I'll tell you why. They don't want the people who they have in the industry to have to go up against me.
""But why? If you're great, if a song is great, you should be able to be put together in the same category.
""Now, what do you think is going to happen when they start voting on these pop categories? And it's a bunch of, you know, people, white or wherever they're from, or older or whatever, and they have to decide between Nicki Minaj and Harry Styles, or Nicki Minaj and Adele?
""That's purposely designed so that Nicki is not in the category that you don't want any competition in. Put her in there so she has more competition and less of a chance to win.""
She referenced 23-year-old Latto's song Big Energy, which she said had been put in the rap category. Big Energy went to number three in the US pop chart and number one on the rap rundown.
""If Super Freaky Girl is pop, then so is Big Energy,"" Minaj argued. ""If you move Super Freaky Girl out of rap and put it in pop, do the same thing with Big Energy. Same producers on both songs, by the way. So let's keep [it] fair.""
An exchange between Minaj and Latto on Twitter quickly descended into personal acrimony.
Minaj has been nominated for 10 Grammys in the past, seven times in rap categories. She pointed out she only raps and does not sing on the X-rated Super Freaky Girl, which heavily samples funk artist Rick James's 1981 single Super Freak.
fuse things further, James's original was nominated for the Grammy for best male rock vocal performance.
Latto's similarly raunchy Big Energy samples another 1981 classic, Tom Tom Club's Genius of Love.
f Grammy categories has often been a bone of contention, with Kacey Musgraves taking issue with a song being switched from country to pop last year, and Justin Bieber complaining about being classed as pop instead of R&B in 2020.
Drake and The Weeknd have both withdrawn their music and been critical of the Grammys in recent years.
Meanwhile, soul duo Silk Sonic - aka Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, who won record and song of the year at this year's Grammys - have withdrawn from next year's race.
give a reason, with Mars saying in a statement to Rolling Stone: ""We thank the Grammys for allowing us to perform on their platform - not once but twice - and awarding us at last year's ceremony. We'd be crazy to ask for anything more.""
Harvey Mason Jr, chief executive of the Recording Academy, which organises the awards, responded by saying: ""We appreciate their decision not to submit this year but look forward to celebrating an amazing year in music together."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63254873

business	IMF: UK set for slowest growth of G7 countries in 2023	"UK is set for the slowest growth of the G7 richest economies next year, the International Monetary Fund has warned.
It is predicting UK growth will fall to just 0.5% in 2023, much lower than its forecast in April of 1.2%.
global economy has shrunk for the first time since 2020, the IMF said, hit by the Ukraine war and Covid-19.
With growth stalling in the UK, US, China and Europe, the world ""may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession"", it said.
""We know that people are feeling the impact of rising prices, caused by global economic factors, triggered by the illegal Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" a HM Treasury spokesperson said in a statement, adding that help for households included £400 off energy bills plus personal tax cuts worth up to £330 a year.
IMF has cut its 2022 global growth forecast to just 3.2% and warned the slowdown risks being even more severe.
It said fast-rising prices were to blame for much of the slowdown, with households and businesses squeezed by a combination of higher prices and higher borrowing costs as policymakers raise interest rates to try to counter inflation.
""The global economy, still reeling from the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is facing an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook,"" economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas wrote in a blog outlining the international lending body's latest economic forecast.
""The outlook has darkened significantly"" since April, the last time the IMF issued forecasts, he added.
global economy contracted in the three months to July, which was the first decline since the pandemic hit, the IMF said.
robability of a recession in the G7 economies - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and UK - now stands at roughly 15% - nearly four times higher than usual.
While UK growth is expected to remain relatively strong this year, Mr Gourinchas said unusually high inflation - faster than in Europe or the US - is expected to take a toll in 2023.
""If you were to look at both years together, it's actually not very far from where the other advanced economies are,"" he told the BBC. ""The one thing that worries me more about the UK economy is that their inflation numbers seem to be quite high. There is a fairly high pass through from high gas prices to broader prices in the economy. 
""That would signal even further monetary policy tightening by the Bank of England and that would also weigh down on growth going forward.""
IMF now expects inflation to reach 6.6% in advanced economies and 9.5% in emerging market and developing economies - nearly a full percentage point higher than it expected in April.
""Inflation at current levels represents a clear risk for current and future macroeconomic stability and bringing it back to central bank targets should be the top priority for policymakers,"" Mr Gourinchas said.
""Tighter monetary policy will inevitably have real economic costs, but delaying it will only exacerbate the hardship.""
fallout from the war in Ukraine is being felt in pockets across the world. Soaring food and fuel prices and higher interest rates means the IMF sees more gloomy prospects for all major economies - but it's the UK that, Russia apart, remains bottom of the pile for 2023. 
Brexit may not have helped but it's our reliance on fossil fuels - they make up 75% of our energy mix, more than in the EU  - that's made us particularly vulnerable to this shock. Those prices are determined on international markets but affect us all. This report comes on the day that, with the energy price cap set to top £3,000 in October, a committee of MPs warns that further government help for households may be needed.  
But the IMF is among those economists who've noted that the UK faces more fundamental issues than the current crisis, with living standards having dropped behind many competitors over the last 15 years, something many attribute to a lack of investment in skills, equipment and infrastructure. Officials from the IMF have previously told me that one way to remedy that would be to raise, not lower taxes, to fund more investment. 
US saw the steepest downgrade of any country for 2022. The IMF cut its growth forecast for the world's largest economy to 2.3% this year, from 3.7% previously, and to just 1% in 2023.
Meanwhile growth in China is expected to fall to 3.3% this year, the slowest rate in nearly four decades, as the country wrestles with new Covid lockdowns and a property crisis.
Questions about the reliability of Europe's natural gas supplies from Russia, as well as political unrest generated by high food and fuel prices, are among the risks the global economy is facing in the months ahead, the IMF said.
""We can be reasonably hopeful that China might be rebound,"" Mr Gourinchas said, adding that he was ""much more concerned about both the inflation path and the tightening of monetary policy leading to a slowdown going ahead"".
It warned that in a ""plausible"" scenario, in which only some of those risks materialise, like a shutdown of Russian gas flows to Europe, global economic growth could fall to 2% next year - a pace the world has fallen below just five times since 1970."	/news/business-62299490
health	How China's Covid protests are being silenced	"China's censorship machine is going to great lengths to prevent people seeing scenes of protest in multiple Chinese cities. 
Demonstrations erupted across the country at the weekend in response to strict anti-Covid measures that have been in place for three years. 
An ever-growing list of words that reference the protests are being censored, and attempts are being made to deflect the narrative on both domestic and overseas platforms. 
rare widespread protests began after ten people died last week in a fire in the city of Urumqi. Many believe residents could not escape the blaze because of Covid restrictions, but authorities have disputed this.
As is generally the case with protests in China - even small-scale ones - Chinese media have made no mention of them. Reports on the country's Covid outbreak over the last few days have been muted, with outlets choosing to focus on upbeat stories like China's latest achievements in space.  
f protest posted on platforms like Twitter, and widely shared internationally, are being ignored by state media outlets.
king about the latest anti-Covid protests, the words ""Shanghai"" and ""Urumqi"" - cities where residents have protested - have been added to a list of censored search terms by platforms like Weibo. Whereas before they showed tens of millions of results on the Chinese social media platform, now they only show hundreds. 
In an attempt to bypass the censorship, people began using terms like ""white paper"" and ""A4"" - a reference to the pieces of bland paper that have become a symbol of the protests. But now even these have become censored search terms on Weibo. 
Far from being deterred, creative social media users are finding new ways to show their solidarity with protestors. They discuss ""A3"" paper instead, and have referenced historic social media trends that mention paper, like the ""A4 skinny waist challenge"". 
One of the most common ways Chinese social media users get messages out is by posting on foreign social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. 
re blocked in mainland China and are only accessible with a piece of software known as a VPN. But some nevertheless have taken to these platforms to highlight demonstrations that have taken place. 
Overseas Chinese have also staged protests outside Chinese embassies, lighting candles and holding blank pieces of paper. 
re scenes that the Communist Party government would rather people - especially overseas Chinese - didn't see. 
Consequently, there has been a large-scale attempt to flood platforms like Twitter with porn and gambling content using the hashtags #Urumqi and #Shanghai, to stop people searching for footage of the protests. 
China has a history of this. During the 2019 Hong Kong protests, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube said they witnessed a co-ordinated attempt by the government to spread disinformation on their channels, and this led to hundreds of accounts and posts being removed.  
While state media for now appear intent on ignoring the protests, there are early signs that they might shape a narrative where foreigners are to blame for scenes of unrest, should they escalate. 
Some are already taking to social media blaming foreigners for instigating the protests.
State media have repeatedly criticised the West for its more lax Covid-19 rules and warned against countries buying into what they see as US rhetoric.
But seeing the rest of the world celebrate in Qatar has fuelled local anger this week. Consequently, China's broadcaster CCTV has moved to avoid showing spectators enjoying matches in its own coverage.  
In addition to this, China introduced eased Covid-19 measures earlier this month. These involved reducing the length of quarantine, making it easier for people to enter the country for short periods of time.
So potentially it will become easier to blame foreigners for the spread of the virus as well. Cases have spiralled to record levels in recent weeks, with more than 40,000 recorded on Monday.
And with no end in sight to China's zero-Covid policy, there is a very realistic possibility of more protests. The number of lockdowns have only increased over the last month, as anybody who tests positive, and their close contacts, are still under orders to quarantine. This hasn't changed since the early stages of the pandemic and people are increasingly frustrated. 
It wouldn't be the first time that China had blamed the West for dissent at home. Hong Kong's 2019 protests - the last large-scale demonstrations in China - were blamed on ""violent extremists"" being influenced by ""Western lackeys""."	/news/world-asia-china-63788477

2019 European junior 1m springboard champion produced a strong last dive but Maddison Keeney of Australia, Nur Sabri of Malaysia and Mia Vallee of Canada held their nerve to take the medals.
England duo Yasmin Harper and Evie Smith came sixth and 10th, while Grace Reid of Scotland was eighth and team-mate Clara Kerr 11th.
Lee struggled for consistency during his six dives, dropping down the leaderboard after his second and fourth before fighting back into the bronze-medal position.
""I'm actually really happy with my bronze medal,"" Lee told BBC Sport.
""For a moment I thought I was out of there because there are some great divers in that competition.
""I obviously wanted to say congratulations to Cassiel - he is a beast, he's so, so good.""
Rousseau, who says he has a fear of heights, only started diving five years ago and worked as a circus performer and sports acrobat before turning to competitive sport.

technology	Twitter drama continues with blue-tick confusion	"witter halted its new $8 blue tick subscription offering on Friday in the latest head spinning reversal at the social media platform since billionaire Elon Musk bought the company. 
move came as a number of accounts impersonating big brands received the blue tick, previously a signal that the firm had verified the user as real.
In one instance, a user claiming to be drugs firm Eli Lilly said ""insulin was free"". 
witter did not comment.
rns about how Mr Musk's leadership was affecting the spread of misinformation on the platform. 
""We apologize to those who have been served a misleading message from a fake Lilly account,"" Eli Lilly tweeted a few hours after the prank post went up on Thursday, reiterating the name of its real Twitter handle. 
firm's shares fell 4% on Friday amid the confusion. 
US-based PR strategist Max Burns said he had seen fake accounts with the verified blue tick badge bought through Twitter Blue posing as support accounts for real airlines and asking customers who were trying to contact them on Twitter to direct message the fake accounts instead.
""How long until a prankster takes a real passenger's ticket information and cancels their flight? Or takes their credit card info and goes on a spending spree?"" he said.
""It will only take one major incident for every airline to bail on Twitter as a source of customer engagement.""
Mr Musk completed his $44bn purchase of Twitter late last month, and swiftly set about overhauling the company.
He has fired roughly 3,700 people - about half of the company's former staff - and pushed the firm to focus on finding ways other than advertising to make money.
His first email to employees warned: ""The road ahead is arduous and will require intense work to succeed.""
""Without significant subscription revenue, there is a good chance Twitter will not survive the upcoming economic downturn,"" he said.
firm's troubles as the digital ad market hits a downturn have been compounded as big brands and marketing firms halt spending on the platform amid concern about its direction.
witter Blue subscription service asked users to pay £6.99 ($7.99) per month for a blue tick, a symbol that was previously free.
move immediately raised concerns about fake accounts - the reason that Twitter had first introduced the system.
Lou Paskalis, president of marketing firm MMA Global, wrote on Twitter that Mr Musk needed to appoint a new chief executive and commit to stepping away from the company's operations. 
""It's clear that leading Twitter is not among your many talents,"" he wrote.
Mr Musk had also said Twitter users engaging in impersonation without clearly specifying a ""parody"" account would be permanently suspended without a warning. 
Several fake brand accounts, including those of Nintendo and BP, have been suspended. 
Mr Musk's actions have prompted the departures of a rash of high-profile executives who had survived the staff cuts, including people in charge of protecting user data.
""I've made the hard decision to leave Twitter,"" tweeted chief security officer Lea Kissner.
Federal Trade Commission on Thursday said it was watching events with ""deep concern"".
Yoel Roth, the site's head of trust and safety, also resigned just a day after staunchly defending Mr Musk's content moderation policy to advertisers.
Late on Thursday, Mr Roth's Twitter bio described him as ""Former Head of Trust & Safety at @Twitter.""
Mr Roth had became the public face of Twitter's content moderation after Mr Musk took over. 
Mr Musk had praised him for defending Twitter's ongoing efforts to fight harmful misinformation and hate speech.
I've heard Twitter in its current state described as an aeroplane, mid-flight, without pilots.
udden departure of the head of trust and safety, the chief information security officer, and both the chief privacy and compliance officers is a dramatic development. It's not clear how soon they will be replaced, while the firm remains this unstable and sweeping job cuts have already been made. 
From a security perspective, Twitter will, like all big platforms, be a constant target for hackers and bad actors around the world, meaning it cannot afford to take its eye off the ball and it must continue to ensure that its systems are robust, and threats are monitored. 
As for users' privacy, you don't need me to tell you how important that is. And indeed, as we've seen, the US regulators are already keeping a very close eye on what's going on. 
Elon Musk, on the other hand, says engagement and user numbers are higher than ever. We only have his word for it - I have to say that anecdotally I'm seeing plenty of Twitter Blue subscribers who seem happy with their new ""blue tick"". And however many of them there are, that's all fresh income that the firm did not previously have.  
But it's also causing its own headache because now anybody can have a badge which until very recently was a symbol of authenticity - including fakes.   And the confusion continues as this service appears to have been paused.
Musk has also said that bankruptcy is not out of the question. While it may feel like we are watching Twitter speeding towards the edge of a cliff, I think it's too early to tell whether it will manage to put the brakes on in time. In the early days of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg's motto was ""move fast and break things"" - Elon Musk appears to have taken this to another level. "	/news/technology-63597087
entertainment	Shuggie Bain: Douglas Stuart's Booker winner gets TV adaptation	"Booker Prize-winning novel Shuggie Bain will be made into a TV series, the BBC has confirmed.
Written by Douglas Stuart, the book tells the story of a young boy and his relationship with his alcoholic mother in 1980s Glasgow.
rogramme will be filmed in Scotland, adapted for BBC One and iPlayer and produced by US film company A24.
Stuart said he was ""thrilled"" the Bain family would be brought to the screen.
He said: ""I am deeply grateful to the BBC and A24 for their belief in Shuggie Bain. 
""I'm thrilled to bring the Bain family to the screen and the opportunity to expand on my novel and to bring new threads to the story, exploring hardships and struggles as well as the compassion, humour, and resilience that is so central to the Scottish spirit."" 
uthor has previously described the novel as a love story between mother Agnes Bain and her gay son Shuggie.
It details Agnes' descent into despair and her struggles with alcoholism following the breakdown of her marriage. 
While most of her children are driven away by her deterioration, Shuggie remains to help - while suffering huge personal problems of his own.
Shuggie Bain was inspired by Stuart's own childhood in Glasgow during the Margaret Thatcher era.
Born in Glasgow in 1976, Stuart's father walked out when he was four and died when he was eight. 
He and his older sister and brother were brought up by his mother, an alcoholic Stuart described as having ""very serious mental health issues"".
His debut novel claimed the 2020 Booker Prize and became an international best seller, sold in 39 countries.
Meanwhile, his second novel, Young Mungo, is a gay love story about two working class teenagers set against an often violent backdrop of Glasgow's housing estates in the 1990s.
Gaynor Holmes, executive producer for the BBC, said: ""Shuggie Bain is an extraordinary novel, with all the makings of extraordinary television. It's a real honour to be working with the immensely talented Douglas Stuart to bring his vision to the BBC.""

business	Firms still fretting over energy bills despite price cap	"Gas and electricity costs for UK businesses, charities and public sector bodies are set to be capped under a new government package.
Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng has suggested that the move could stop companies from collapsing under the weight of soaring energy bills this winter.
While some trade bodies have welcomed the news, others like UK Hospitality warned that the government must avoid a ""cliff-edge"" when the six months of help finishes at the end of March.
BBC has spoken to several firms across different sectors about what the announcement could mean for them. 
At Ye Olde Fleece Inn in Kendal, Cumbria, they have not ""done the maths"" yet, but are relieved to have more certainty.
rise they were facing - from £44,000 a year for gas and electric, to around £124,000 a year - will be avoided, for now. 
""That some help is coming gives us a bit of hope,"" says Josh Farrant, front of house manager. ""But we are still massively going to have to look at the way we do things.""
Customers are already having to forgo sourdough toast - the cost of running the grill is ""ridiculous"" at current prices, says Mr Farrant.
'll be looking at other kitchen equipment and whether they can rely more on the pub's log fires, less on central heating.
And while the government support is very welcome, Mr Farrant still has concerns, especially about what will happen in a few months time.
""It doesn't mean the panic is over,"" he says. ""It's going to run for six months, then we'll see.""
Kate Phillips is relieved to have ""a reprieve"" over the rising cost of running her chain of indoor climbing walls.
""In the medium-term, it means we can run some heating this winter,"" she says. ""Our original plan was to warn our customers to bring warm jackets with them.""
may still be necessary come the spring. These vast indoor spaces cost a lot to heat and the help is only temporary.
""It's all a bit last minute, all a bit ""short-period"", leaving us not sure what will happen in six months' time,"" she says.
Climbers don't want it as warm as at a gym, Kate explains, as they don't want their hands to sweat. ""But they do want to be able to feel their fingers.""
me fixed rate deals still in place for electricity, so Ms Phillips is trying to work out if they will save more by investing in more electric heating.
She hopes that will leave some ""wiggle room"" to offer more hours, or recruit new staff over the winter when they're at their busiest.

""This doesn't help us at all!"" says Nimisha Raja, founder of Nim's Fruit Crisps, who was not impressed with the level of intervention.
Air-drying crisps uses large amounts of energy and gas is her single biggest cost.
She points out the scheme doesn't offer help with daily standing charges - the fee customers pay for being connected to the energy grid.
""When we entered into a new contract on April 1st, the only option available to my business was one with a £14 per day standing charge.""
firm's gas bills have increased from £2,500 a month on average to about £7,500 as a result, she says.
She would like the government to have been bolder, including reforming the energy market, or considering a bigger windfall tax on the energy companies that are benefiting from higher prices, a move the new prime minister has ruled out.
""Small and medium-sized businesses need a little bit more from the government,"" Ms Raja says. 
""What will - and is already - slowing down growth across all sectors is the crippling energy costs, forcing many small businesses to close.""
Angie Monroe, who runs a small salon in Stourport, Worcestershire, says her energy bills have tripled in the past year to around £280 a month on average in the summer.
""It's mainly only me here serving customers,"" she says ""But my prediction will be come winter my bills will double again, even with the cap in place because of the energy used in the heating and appliances we've got to use.""
It's already a struggle making ends meet with costs for hair colour and gloves increasing recently. 
""It's frustrating because I want to know why this [scheme] wasn't put in place sooner,"" Ms Monroe says.
But above all she is wondering what will happen long-term after the support package comes to an end next March.
""We might feel secure for that time, but lots of businesses out there will still be anxious, wondering what their bills are going to look like in the future.
McKenzie, the policy and advocacy chair at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: ""Small businesses are the definition of vulnerable when it comes to these energy price hikes.
""[They do not] have the ability to hedge, or negotiate energy prices, so we will be encouraging government to continue to help small businesses across all different sectors after the six months have elapsed.""
Many still face ""a tough year"" ahead, she says."	/news/business-62980637

business	Persil advert banned for misleading green claims	"Unilever's advert for one of its laundry detergents, Persil, has been banned for being misleading about its environmental benefits.
rt said Persil was ""kinder to our planet"", and featured children picking up litter on a beach.
Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the advert's claim was unsubstantiated. 
Unilever, which owns brands including Hellmann's and Dove, said it is ""disappointed"" with the result. 
It follows a crackdown by the ASA on ""greenwashing"" - claims made by firms branding products as eco-friendly, green or sustainable. 
In the banned television advert, beaches are shown full of litter and then children are shown picking up the rubbish.  
A voiceover said: ""For real change we all need to roll up our sleeves and get dirty"". 
xt on the screen stating that the product ""removes stains at 30C"" is shown, with the Persil bottle, which the advert states is made with 50% recycled plastic. 
""Tough on stains and kinder to our planet,"" the voiceover adds. 
A viewer complained to the watchdog that Persil's claims of being ""kinder"" to the planet were unsubstantiated.  
regulator upheld the complaint and said that the claims could only be justified if the product provides an environmental benefit over other similar products. 
""Although we acknowledged Persil were undertaking actions to reduce the environmental impact of their products, we had not seen evidence or analysis to demonstrate the overall environmental impact of the featured liquid detergents over their full-life cycles, compared with Persil's own previous products or other products, in support of the claim 'kinder to our planet'"", the ASA said. 
Unilever countered that the advert showed how its liquid detergent was ""kinder"" to the planet because it saved energy by cleaning in fast washes and at lower temperatures. It also said it was ""kinder"" because the product used recycled plastic.
A spokesperson for Unilever told the BBC that is was ""disappointed"" with the ASA's result.
""We are committed to making on-going improvements to all our products to make them more sustainable and will continue to look at how we can share this with our shoppers"", Unilever said.
ASA banned the advert because it concluded that the basis of the claim ""kinder to our planet"" had not been made clear.
regulator also said the ad featured ""various strands of messaging"" about Persil's wider environmental initiatives including encouraging people to ""personally take action to care for the environment"", and showing children collecting plastic litter. 
""In the context of the entire ad with several messages relating to environmental issues, we considered the meaning and basis of the claim ""kinder to our planet"" was unclear,"" the ASA said. 
""Additionally, in the absence of evidence demonstrating that the full-life cycle of the product had a lesser environmental impact compared to a previous formulation, we concluded the ad was likely to mislead,"" a spokesperson from the ASA added. "	/news/business-62726666
entertainment	Dolly Parton leads tributes to Loretta Lynn	"Dolly Parton has paid tribute to the ""wonderful talent"" Loretta Lynn, following the country music star's death at the age of 90.
""So sorry to hear about my sister, friend Loretta,"" said the singer.
""We've been like sisters all the years we've been in Nashville and she was a wonderful human being.""
Carole King, Carrie Underwood, Billy Ray Cyrus and Jack White have also paid tribute to Lynn, who was best known for the song Coal Miner's Daughter.
White, who recorded an album with the star in 2004, called her both a ""mother figure"" and ""the greatest female singer-songwriter of the 20th century"".
""She was such an incredible presence and such a brilliant genius in ways that I think only people who got to work with her might know about,"" he said in an Instagram video. 
""What she did for feminism, women's rights in a time period, in a genre of music that was the hardest to do it in, is just outstanding and will live on for a long time. 
""She broke down a lot of barriers for people that came after her.""
untry star died on Tuesday at her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee, her family said in a statement.
She built her stardom on music that addressed the struggles of women, at a time when country music often marginalised their voices. Her songs were full of rural pride, determination and autobiographical details from her own, often rocky, marriage.
Her signature song, Coal Miner's Daughter, documented her humble beginnings in a one-room log cabin in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky, where she was the second of eight siblings.
Other hits, including The Fist, Rated X and Don't Come Home A-Drinkin', were expressions of female resolve and standing up to unfaithful men.
""Up to now I've been an object made for pleasin' you,"" she sang on 1978's We've Come A Long Way, Baby. ""Times have changed and I'm demanding satisfaction too.""
Some of her songs, in particular The Pill, which celebrated reproductive freedom, upset the conservative programmers of country music radio, but she still scored 16 number one hits, and influenced generations.
""I sure appreciate her paving the rough and rocky road for all us girl singers,"" said country star Reba McEntire on Instagram. 
""She blazed so many trails for all of us girls in country music,"" agreed Miranda Lambert.
""It's safe to say I wouldn't even be making country music today if it weren't for Loretta Lynn,"" added Margo Price. ""Her writing was as real as the day was long.""
Carrie Underwood shared the story of her first encounter with Lynn, at Nashville's Grand Ole Opry, in a lengthy Instagram post.
""I was chatting in the corner with another artist and someone walked behind me and smacked me on the rear end!"" she recalled. 
""I turned around and there she was, in a big sparkly dress, laughing as she continued to walk down the hall at what she had just done.
""This is one of my most favourite stories to tell. I think it sums up her personality pretty well. She was a cantankerous little pistol… friendly and sweet… never afraid to be herself and speak her mind.""
Underwood added: ""She is irreplaceable. She will be incredibly missed… but her legacy lives on in those of us whom she has influenced.""
Carole King called Lynn an ""inspiration"" while k.d. lang described her as ""joyous, fierce, one of a kind"".
Billy Ray Cyrus said that ""one of my highest honours"" came when Lynn agreed to duet with him and George Jones on the song Country Music Has The Blues. 
""She handed me this wonderful gift on that day,"" he added, alongside a photo of a signed copy of Lynn's album Van Lear Rose.
Lynn's half-sister and fellow country star Crystal Gayle simply tweeted: ""The world lost a legend. We lost a sister. Love you, Loretta.""

technology	Meta ordered to sell Giphy by UK's competition watchdog CMA	"UK's competition watchdog has reissued an order to Meta to sell animated images platform Giphy.
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said this ruling was final, after going back and forth with the tech giant since its decision was first announced last year. 
CMA found that the takeover of the gif-creation website could harm social media users and advertising.
A Meta spokesperson said it accepted the decision but was ""disappointed"".
ruling is the first time the UK has blocked an acquisition by a tech giant, signalling a new determination to scrutinise digital deals.
Meta had bought Giphy - the largest supplier of animated gifs to social networks such as Snapchat, TikTok and Twitter - in 2020.
CMA investigated the sale and published its original decision in November 2021, ordering Meta to dispose of Giphy.
Meta, then called Facebook Inc, had been fined a record £50.5m for refusing to comply with the CMA during the investigation.
Meta had hoped its purchase of Giphy would improve finding gifs and stickers on its social networks Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook.
While Meta maintained that Giphy would be ""openly available"" to other social networks, the CMA's investigation found the buyout would harm competition in social media and advertising. 
Meta appealed against this decision, but in July the Competition Appeal Tribunal found in the CMA's favour on all but one ground, which was related to third-party confidential information. 
After that finding, the CMA said it reviewed its original decision that Meta would have to sell Giphy and was standing by it.
It said it was concerned the deal would not only limit choice for those on social media but it would also reduce innovation in digital display advertising in the UK.
Stuart McIntosh, chair of the independent inquiry group carrying out the CMA's investigation, said there was no other option but for Meta to sell Giphy. 
""This deal would significantly reduce competition in two markets,"" he said.
""It has already resulted in the removal of a potential challenger in the UK display ad market, while also giving Meta the ability to further increase its substantial market power in social media.""
In a statement, the social network said it accepted the decision, adding: ""We are grateful to the Giphy team during this uncertain time for their business, and wish them every success. 
""We will continue to evaluate opportunities - including through acquisition - to bring innovation and choice to more people in the UK and around the world.""
Paul Stone, from law firm Charles Russell Speechlys, told the BBC: ""The significance of the CMA's decision is that it underscores the body's concerns about the impact of the deal on future innovation in digital advertising.
""This seems to be key to the CMA's approach to regulating big tech in the UK, where preserving competition from small but potentially significant future challengers can be at least as important as maintaining competition between already established players in the sector."""	/news/technology-63302179

health	NHS pay offer credible but falls short, union says	"Royal College of Nursing has said the Scottish government's final pay offer averaging 7.5% ""falls short"" of their demands but is ""credible"".
It comes after the Unite union called off planned work-to-rule by its members in the Scottish Ambulance Service and the GMB suspended a 26-hour strike.    
Unison is recommending its members accept the £515m deal.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said there was ""nothing left in the coffers"".
RCN had asked for at least 5% above inflation, which is currently 11.1%.
urses' body has confirmed two strike dates before Christmas in England, Northern Ireland and Wales.
Scottish government said the new deal was a ""record high pay offer"" for frontline employees, including nurses, paramedics, allied health professionals and healthcare support staff.
Annual pay rises under the latest deal would range from a flat rate payment of £2,205 for staff in bands 1 to 4 and up to £2,660 for staff in bands 5 to 7, backdated to April.
represents an increase of 11.3% for the lowest-paid workers and delivers an average uplift of 7.5%, a government spokesperson said.
w offer for staff on Agenda for Change contracts also includes a review into reducing the working week from 37.5 hours to 36 hours with no loss of pay.
RCN Scotland director Colin Poolman told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""We went into what have been very complex and intense negotiations and we've received an improved offer.
""It falls short of what our members were asking for, although we do see it as a credible offer.
""It will now be for our board, who are nurses in the NHS, to initially make a decision on the next steps in relation to that offer.
""They will make the decision on whether this offer goes out to the wider membership and we will keep the members updated on the progress of that.""
Mr Poolman said it would be up to the RCN board to decide whether to recommend the offer to members or not.
""[The offer] means very different things to very different people in the grades,"" he added.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and the health secretary were involved in ""extensive"" talks ahead of this latest proposal.
Another £35m has been put towards the latest deal to avert winter strikes in the health service.
Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland he was ""delighted to be able to table a record pay offer"".
He said: ""It's a great offer, it's a record offer, and I hope that nurses and other NHS staff take a look at it and realise it's a fair offer too, given the financial constraints that we're under.""
retary told BBC Scotland that he ""would love to give an inflation-busting offer, [but] I'm not able to.""
He added: ""I can't go any further, so that is why this is the final offer. I think it's the best offer.
""Unison, the largest health trade union, have recognised that it's one worthy of accepting and therefore I hope other NHS staff look at the deal and, in the circumstances, agree that it's a fair one.""
Mr Poolman said RCN board deliberations would take place over the next few days.
""We've got to take the government at their word,"" he said. 
""At the negotiations, it was made very clear at the end by both the first minister and the cabinet secretary they do not believe that they can find any more resource and that this is their final offer.""
He added: ""These are exceptional times. It's still an offer that falls short of what were our asks.

health	Harry and Meghan: What's the link between stress and miscarriage?	"""I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second,"" wrote Meghan in 2020, after experiencing a miscarriage.
Fast forward two years, and in their new documentary the Duke and Duchess of Sussex both blame the stress caused by their legal fight with a newspaper.
Experts say more research is needed to understand why miscarriages happen but stress alone wouldn't be a cause.
With a number of factors at play, they say parents shouldn't blame themselves.
It's estimated that about one in five pregnancies ends in miscarriage - that's about 500 every single day in the UK.
Meghan has been vocal in the past about the importance of talking about the ""staggering commonality of pain"" caused by losing a baby. 
She covered the topic in a piece she wrote for the New York Times in 2020.
At the time, the couple were in a bitter court battle with the publisher of the Mail on Sunday after it printed a letter Meghan had sent to her dad.
""Do we absolutely know that the miscarriage was caused by that? Of course we don't,"" says Prince Harry in their Netflix series. 
""But bearing in mind the stress, the lack of sleep... I can say from what I saw that that miscarriage was created by what they were trying to do to her.""
uchess won her privacy and copyright case against Associated Newspapers Limited last year. 
It's often not possible to know what causes a miscarriage and a lot more research needs to be done.
While there is some evidence to suggest there may be a link between stress and miscarriage, the NHS and charities agree it is not a cause on its own.
""After a miscarriage, most people will ask themselves what caused it, why it happened,"" says Ruth Bender Atik, from the Miscarriage Association.
""Unfortunately, very few people will have an obvious cause diagnosed.
""In that situation, we tend to seek our own explanation, what we did or didn't do - and stress is one of those.""
Most miscarriages happen early in pregnancy. These tend to be caused by random chromosomal abnormalities - problems with a foetus's DNA which mean it can't develop properly.
After three months, a wide number of factors, including infections, the mother's age or a weakened cervix could be a reason.
Miscarriage research charity Tommy's says there's some evidence of a link between persistent stress and miscarriage.
But this is often connected to other lifestyle risk factors, such as poor sleep and diet or substance abuse.
It says it's important women don't worry unnecessarily about stress, which is normal during pregnancy. 
""What we don't want to do is scare women unnecessarily from being at work or engaging in stressful activities,"" says Dr Ellie Cannon, a GP.
She says there has always been an ""unhelpful"" misconception linking stress and miscarriage. 
""I have a huge amount of sympathy for any couple that's gone through miscarriage,"" she says. 
""It's a very difficult time, it's incredibly personal and any woman going through this will experience that differently.""
But she adds that it's important to recognise stress as not being a sole cause, to limit feelings of guilt and anxiety for pregnant women.
Amina Hatia, from Tommy's, says those who experience miscarriage will question why it happened and ""often blame themselves, feeling guilty about what they feel they did or didn't do"".
""We have very little control over stress in our lives, and in any pregnancy it is natural at times to feel a bit anxious or stressed,"" she says. 
""Therefore, telling people 'not to stress' for their own emotional and physical health doesn't usually work.""
Amina says it can even be counterproductive, leading to more guilt and worry.
re is, however, a strong emphasis on mental wellbeing.
Experts agree it's just as important as physical health during pregnancy and pregnant women should get the help they need.
And most women who miscarry go on to have healthy pregnancies - Harry and Meghan welcomed their daughter, Lilibet, in June 2021.

entertainment	Eurovision: Mayor slams 'grossly inflated' hotel prices	"Liverpool's metro mayor is preparing to intervene over the price-hike for accommodation during the Eurovision Song Contest.  
Steve Rotheram said he was deeply disappointed at the ""grossly inflated prices"" with some accommodation advertised at up to £8,000 a night.
He said he did not want anybody to be prevented from visiting the city because of the cost.
Liverpool was announced on Friday as the host of May's competition.
Mr Rotheram said Eurovision was a ""welcome distraction for millions of people"" following recent ""turbulent"" times.
""For our area it is a fantastic chance to showcase all that is good in a great city - and beyond,"" he said.
""That is why it is so disappointing to see some businesses in our region who have jumped at the chance to grossly inflate prices.
""I've called this behaviour out several times before, especially when football fans have been ripped off for flights and accommodation.""
He said he would be talking to ""political colleagues"" about how to respond.
Eurovision fan Connor Gregory told BBC North West Tonight he booked his accommodation weeks ago for £200.
fter Liverpool was announced as the host city he said his booking was cancelled.
When he checked online he said: ""I'd seen that my booking had been cancelled and that dates around May, dates around Eurovision time were up to £20,000.""
Chris Brown, director of Marketing Liverpool, has said details of other accommodation options would be released later this week.

business	Wizz Air boss sparks backlash over fatigue request	"Wizz Air is facing a backlash from pilot unions after the airline's boss appeared to call on crew to work through fatigue.
Chief executive Jozsef Varadi said staff should go ""the extra mile"" when tired so that the airline could avoid cancelling flights.
Pilot unions said flying when fatigued is dangerous and his comments showed a ""deficient safety culture"".
But Wizz Air said Mr Varadi was addressing all workers not just pilots. 
Like some airlines, Wizz Air has been forced to cancel flights over the recent Jubilee bank holiday which coincided with schools' half-term break because of ""widespread shortages in staff"". 
On Wednesday Mr Varadi told workers: ""Now that everyone is getting back into work, I understand that fatigue is a potential outcome of the issues but once we are starting stabilising the rosters, we also need to take down the fatigue rate.
""I mean, we cannot run this business when every fifth person of a base reports sickness because the person is fatigued. We are all fatigued but sometimes it is required to take the extra mile.""
Mr Varadi added, ""The damage is huge when we are cancelling the flights, it's huge. It is reputational damage of the brand and it is the other financial damage, transactional damage because we have to pay compensation for that.""
European Cockpit Association, which has been pushing for union recognition at Wizz Air, shared a short clip of Mr Varadi's address.
It said the comments encouraged pilots to fly when fatigued, and called on regulators to step in.
""It's like handing the car keys to a drunk driver,"" the union said, adding it showed a ""deficient safety culture"" at the airline.
Martin Chalk, general secretary of the British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa), said that ""fatigue has been shown, in many studies, to have effects on a person's thinking and decision making similar to alcohol"".
""No-one supports pilots or other safety sensitive staff working with alcohol in their system,"" he said, adding that he was ""very surprised by the apparent views of Mr Varadi on fatigue"".
He called on Mr Varadi to clarify his comments, and that if he really believed pilots should fly when fatigued, ""he should consider whether he is in the right job"".
When airline pilots are very tired ""it can be life or death"", he added. ""People's lives are important, and we don't squander them for no reason - definitely not for profit.""
re are restrictions on the number of hours air crew are supposed to work.
Rules state that air crew should not fly, and should not be required to fly, if they are in a state of fatigue which could endanger passengers or the aircraft.
Wizz Air denied that Mr Varadi was specifically targeting pilots but was speaking to all staff. It said in a statement:  ""Our crew unavailability has been very low, at 4%. In this context, going the extra mile to minimise disruption was discussed.
""What this does not mean is compromising safety. Wizz Air and the airline industry are highly regulated, and safety has, and always will be, our first priority."" 
It added: ""This clip has been edited from an all staff briefing - not pilots only, but also cabin crew and all office employees - on key business updates and current challenges facing aviation."""	/news/business-61741139
business	UK may already be in recession - Bank of England	"Bank of England has raised interest rates from 1.75% to 2.25% - the highest level for 14 years - and warned the UK may already be in a recession.
ral bank had previously expected the economy to grow between July and September but it now believes it will shrink by 0.1%.
It is the Bank's seventh rate rise in a row as it tries to tame soaring prices.
It takes borrowing costs to their highest since 2008, when the global banking system faced collapse.
Inflation - the pace at which prices rise - is currently at its highest rate for nearly 40 years, leaving many people facing hardship.  
Prices are also widely predicted to head higher in October, despite a government plan to limit soaring gas and electricity prices for households and businesses.  
Raising interest rates makes it more expensive to borrow which should, in theory, encourage people to spend less and cool prices. 
But many households with mortgages will see their costs rise. People on a typical tracker mortgage will have to pay about £49 more a month, while those on standard variable rate mortgages will see a £31 increase.
fixed-rate deals will not be immediately affected, although their costs could jump when their deals come up for renewal.
Bank now expects the UK economy to shrink between July and September. This comes after the economy already shrank slightly between April and June and will push the UK into recession, defined as when an economy shrinks for two consecutive quarters.
It said a smaller-than-expected bounce back in July from the June bank holiday to celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee and the additional bank holiday in September for the Queen's state funeral had both hit the economy.
Bank, however, said it now expected inflation to not rise as high as it originally expected, saying the government's help on energy bills for households and firms would help limit soaring prices.
It now expects inflation to peak at just under 11% in October, having previously forecast it would reach 13% next month.
Nevertheless, inflation is currently nearly five times the Bank of England's 2% target and even if it peaks in October, it is expected to remain above 10% ""over the following few months"" before starting to fall.
As the Bank acts to calm inflation, the new chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng is preparing to announce a ""mini-budget"" on Friday when he is expected to cut taxes and reveal other measures to boost economic activity. There has been some concern that the plans could fan inflation.
On Thursday the Bank said: ""Should the outlook suggest more persistent inflationary pressures, including from stronger demand, the [rate-setting] committee will respond forcefully, as necessary.""
Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. said: ""That new 'stronger demand' bit seems like a not-so-subtle reference to the loosening in fiscal policy that's expected to be announced tomorrow.
""In short, the Bank has indicated it will raise rates further to offset some of the boost to demand from the government's fiscal plans.""
Some economists had expected the Bank to lift rates by 0.75 percentage points this month, in line with similar moves by the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, and three of the MPC's nine members voted for such a rise.
In Grimsby, self-employed auditor Kristine Green said she had ""nothing left to cut back on"" as she struggled to cover the monthly cost of her variable rate mortgage. 
She said her repayments had already gone up four or five times in the past year.
""There were two instances where the increases happened in such quick succession, I didn't even get a letter about it from my mortgage provider.""
She said with the latest increase on Thursday, her mortgage would soon be edging on £460-470 per month, about £100 more than what she was paying this time last year.
Higher interest rates will also drive up borrowing costs for businesses, many of which already face crippling energy and fuel bills. 
Jonathan Fell, managing director of family theme park the Ice Cream Farm in Cheshire, said he had taken out millions of pounds in loans to develop the business in recent years. 
Although some were on fixed five-year terms, an emergency government loan he was granted during the pandemic follows the base rate set by the Bank of England. 
""Any further rate increases would be hugely worrying,"" he said. ""It could actually finish the business depending on how far it goes."" 
Bank of England has continued on its path of interest rate raises, but the real question now is how high are rates going to go. Financial markets predict that the rate will go close to 5%, and that is higher than in the US and the Eurozone. This reflects higher inflation here.
Bank held back from a 0.75 percentage point jumbo rate rise, as the US Fed had done last night. Foreign exchange markets were looking to see whether the UK would follow the US tough rhetoric against inflation too. But it was a close vote.
Bank expressed some relief that inflation would now peak at 11% next month, thanks to the government's energy interventions. But rates are still going up because the Bank sees more inflation arising from the British economy itself, even as the energy shock has been muffled.
All eyes are now on November, when the Bank will calculate a new forecast to assess all of the government's interventions, which bring down inflation but also raise borrowing.
Already the rise in mortgage rates is weighing on the housing market. The Bank believes we are already in a recession. The rate rises will keep coming. Precisely how many is the question.

gy - developed by the University of the West of Scotland - was originally created to quickly detect Covid-19 from X-ray images.
fy a range of different lung diseases like tuberculosis and pneumonia.
re now looking at whether it can be used to detect cancers.   
gnose patients in a matter of minutes with an accuracy of around 98%.
Researcher Prof Naeem Ramzan said: ""Systems such as this could prove to be crucial for busy medical teams worldwide.""
uberculosis and pneumonia often require a combination of tests like CT scans, blood tests, X-rays and ultrasounds to diagnose.
But these tests can be expensive and time consuming. 
Prof Ramzan told BBC Scotland that in normal circumstances, diagnosis can take weeks depending on the radiologist's availability.
""But in most cases, the app can produce results in a minute so treatment can be started as soon as possible,"" he said.
gy uses X-rays, then compares the scans to a database of thousands of images from patients with pneumonia, tuberculosis and Covid.
It then uses a process known as deep convolutional neural network, an algorithm typically used to analyse imagery, to make a diagnosis.
Researchers at the institution are now looking into using the technology to detect other diseases using X-ray images like cancer. 
""X-ray imaging is a relatively cheap and accessible diagnostic tool that already assists in the diagnosis of various conditions, including pneumonia, tuberculosis and Covid-19,"" said Prof Ramzan.
""Recent advances in AI have made automated diagnosis using chest X-ray scans a very real prospect in medical settings.""
However, the new technology could take up to a year to be approved for wider use.
Prof Ramzan added: ""We would like to roll it out worldwide and make it freely available to anyone who would like to use it, either in the NHS or abroad as well.""
He said it is already used for diagnosing Covid-19 in some rural areas of Pakistan."	/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-63541927

He then posted a video revealing his face for the first time.
Minecraft is the world's bestselling video game and Dream's most popular videos have tens of millions of views, with one having been watched more than 115 million times.
""Hi, my name is Clay, otherwise known as Dream,"" he said in a five-minute video viewed more than 12 million times.

technology	US bans sale of Huawei, ZTE tech amid security fears	"US has banned the sale and import of new communications equipment from five Chinese companies, including Huawei and ZTE, amid concerns over national security.
Other companies listed include Hikvision, Dahua and Hytera, which make video surveillance equipment and two-way radio systems. 
It is the first time US regulators have taken such a move on security grounds.
Hikvision said that its products present no security threat to the US.
It said the decision ""will do nothing to protect US national security, but will do a great deal to make it more harmful and more expensive for US small businesses, local authorities, school districts, and individual consumers to protect themselves, their homes, businesses and property.""
Huawei and others have previously denied supplying data to the Chinese government.
US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said its members had voted unanimously on Friday to adopt the new rules.
""The FCC is committed to protecting our national security by ensuring that untrustworthy communications equipment is not authorised for use within our borders,"" the commission's chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement. 
""These new rules are an important part of our ongoing actions to protect the American people from national security threats involving telecommunications,"" she added.
Because the ban is not retroactive, the firms listed can continue to sell products previously approved for sale in the US.
But the FCC said it is seeking comment on future revisions to the rules regarding equipment already authorised to be imported or sold, meaning it is possible existing authorisations could also be revoked in the future.
restrictions in the US are the latest levied against Chinese tech firms following spying concerns, which US officials have become increasingly wary of in recent years.
Under Barack Obama's administration, actions designed to limit Chinese telecoms firms' access to the US market first took root. They were then accelerated during the presidency of Donald Trump and have continued under current US President Joe Biden's rule.

business	BA extends sales ban on Heathrow short-haul tickets	"British Airways has suspended ticket sales for short-haul flights from Heathrow Airport for a further week until 15 August.
On Monday, the airline said it had stopped selling the tickets until 8 August, but now it has gone a step further. 
move is due to the cap on daily passenger numbers that the UK's biggest airport has imposed over the summer.
uspension will affect BA's flights to domestic and European destinations.
usands of air travellers have been hit by disruption in recent months, including last-minute cancellations, which have been caused largely by staff shortages.
Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during Covid lockdowns, have found it difficult to recruit enough staff as demand for holidays has returned.
Heathrow Airport has struggled to cope with the rebound in air travel and problems with its baggage handling systems have also led to passengers seeing huge delays in reclaiming their luggage.
Last month, Heathrow told airlines to stop selling summer tickets, as it said it would limit the number of passengers departing each day to 100,000 - 4,000 fewer than previously scheduled.
umbers is set to remain in place until 11 September.
As BA is the largest airline at Heathrow it is affected by the limit more than other carriers. It is understood the airline was close to reaching the number of passengers it could carry under the current limit.
In a statement, BA said it had taken ""pre-emptive action to reduce our schedule this summer to give customers certainty about their travel plans"".
""When Heathrow introduced its passenger cap, we took a small number of additional flights from our schedule and to continue to comply with the cap, we've been taking responsible action by limiting sales or all the available fares on some of our Heathrow services to ensure more seats are available to rebook customers,"" the company said.
mpany added that it would ""continue to manage bookings to be within the Heathrow imposed cap"". 
BA could limit or suspend sales again while Heathrow's cap is in place. The impact will be mainly on short-haul flights, though long-haul routes could sometimes be affected.
Aviation consultant John Strickland said BA's short-haul flights over the next week would effectively be full, leaving ""almost no room to manoeuvre to rebook passengers"" in the case of unforeseen problems such as bad weather. 
""It therefore has little choice but to take seats off sale to protect for this eventuality and sacrifice last minute high price ticket sales,"" he said. 
Mr Strickland added that most last-minute sales go to business travellers, for which volume is lowest in August, ""so the sacrifice is minimal"". 
Consumer group Which? said the move by BA would reduce customer choice and lead to ""significant price increases"".
On Tuesday evening, a direct flight from Heathrow to Frankfurt this coming Saturday cost a minimum of £617, compared with £243 in two weeks time, according to flight comparison website Skyscanner. 
Stopping selling some tickets from Britain's biggest airport in the lucrative summer peak, when demand is strong, is not something you'd normally expect an airline to be doing.
But this isn't a normal summer. 
follows Heathrow's extraordinary decision to limit traffic to a level the system can cope with, given ongoing resourcing challenges.
It's understood British Airways was close to reaching the number of passengers it could carry under that cap this week.
meant to prevent last-minute bookings. And it should leave some leeway in the system for where rebooking is needed.
't about cancellations - existing bookings aren't affected.
But it will limit passengers' last-minute options at a time when capacity has been squeezed and many prices have risen.
And it might not be the end - BA has made it clear that while Heathrow's passenger cap is in place, it may have to pause sales again.
BA has cut nearly 30,000 flights from its April-to-October schedule in response to staffing problems.
On Friday, BA owner IAG reported its first profit since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, despite facing what it called a ""challenging"" environment at Heathrow Airport.
mpany said the problems at Heathrow had forced British Airways to limit its capacity to 69.1% of pre-pandemic levels between April and June, and this was expected to increase to about 75% between July and October.
A row broke out last week between Ryanair and Heathrow, after the airline said airports had not recruited enough staff to cater for the rebound in travellers, saying they ""had one job to do"".
But Heathrow hit back at the criticism, describing it as ""bizarre"".
""Airports don't provide ground handling, that's provided by the airlines themselves. So this is like accusing us of not having enough pilots,"" said Heathrow's chief executive John Holland-Kaye.
Virgin Atlantic also criticised the airport, claiming it was responsible for failures which were contributing to the chaos.
Emirates Airlines had initially rejected Heathrow's request to cut flight capacity but later agreed to cap sales following talks between the two companies. 
Last month the Competition and Markets Authority and Civil Aviation Authority issued a joint letter to carriers raising concerns that some airlines may not be doing everything they could to avoid harmful practices, including selling more tickets for flights than they could reasonably expect to supply.
Airports outside the UK have also faced issues. On Tuesday Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, which has faced staff shortages, said it would continue to limit passengers in September and October to ensure safety and a reliable service. "	/news/business-62386909
sports	Beach handball: 'It's shocking to have to pay to not play in our pants'	"From getting in trouble for refusing to wear a bikini, to getting support from a Grammy-winning artist, it's been quite a week for Norway's women's beach handball team.
m decided to wear shorts instead of bikini bottoms at the European Beach Handball Championships in a move which led them to being fined £1,295.
""It's so shocking that we have to pay for not playing in our panties,"" Tonje Lerstad tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.
But there was more shock round the corner for the 24-year-old goalkeeper and her fellow players.
She says they were all ""star-struck"" when Pink tweeted her support for their decision - the singer even offered to pay the fine herself.
""It's really crazy. We were shocked but it's such an important message and we appreciate it,"" Tonje says.
je says ""things got very crazy"" after the players made their stand over the uniform rules.
She wasn't surprised they were fined - they'd been warned that would happen - but she calls the punishment ""incredible"".
""It's really stupid, but we've just got to fight on."" 
Pink said in response to Tonje's team's fine that the European Handball Federation (EHF) should be ""fined for sexism"".
""I'm very proud of the Norwegian female beach handball team for protesting sexist rules about their uniform,"" she added in her tweet.
EHF said the fine was imposed because of ""improper clothing"".
rue to Pink's track Get The Party Started, the team began to celebrate after her tweet to her 30 million followers.
""We sent it in our group chat and everybody was like: 'Wow, this is sick.' It was so weird,"" says Tonje.

politics	Energy payments: Rishi Sunak promises NI £600 update shortly	"Rishi Sunak says the £600 energy support payments will be made this winter
Households in Northern Ireland will receive their £600 energy support payment this winter, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has insisted.
His comment comes after Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said energy firms had suggested it could take until June for all households to receive the payment.
Mr Sunak did not say when the discount would be applied to bills but said an announcement would come ""very shortly"".
He was speaking during his first visit to Northern Ireland since becoming PM.
re has been continued uncertainty about a due date the energy support payments in Northern Ireland, the first of which was announced in May.
A £400 payment was initially promised by the UK government for all households to help them to deal with rising prices for gas and electricity.
A further £200 payment was announced last month because of the proportion of homes in Northern Ireland that use home heating oil.
People in Great Britain started benefitting from the support in October.
But last month the UK government said households in Northern Ireland would have to wait until after Christmas to receive the help.
Speaking on Friday morning, Mr Sunak said: ""Everyone in Northern Ireland will receive £600.
""That's more than everyone else in Great Britain because we recognise that many people in Northern Ireland are reliant on heating oil.
""That money will be delivered this winter.""
But Ms Long said energy firms had suggested that the UK government's plan to allow people to ""cash out"" the support they were entitled to would mean the rollout would take much longer than planned.
""[Energy companies] have said they could start to deliver it in January but realistically it would still be being rolled out in June,"" she said.
""It's a shocking admission of the lack of preparation that's gone in to any scheme and it leaves a major gap that I think needs to be filled in terms of crisis payments to get people through the winter.
""Frankly having more money for energy in June isn't really what people need - they need it now when there's snow and frost on the ground.""
Ms Long said Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris had ""pushed back hard"" against that suggestion when she raised it with him on Thursday.
""He felt that wasn't the case, that it would be done more quickly,"" she said.
""But irrespective, we're probably talking at least three to four months until the entire package has been delivered.
""For a lot of people that is going to leave them in a really difficult situation, given that they were told it would be in their account by the end of November at one stage.
""A lot of people have spent money on the strength of thinking that was going to come and it hasn't.""
Asked why the energy payment scheme was so taking so long to resolve, Mr Sunak said the delay demonstrated why it was important to have devolved government at Stormont in place.
""This is one of the things where this is why we need to have an executive back up and running, to deliver on these types of challenges for people,"" he said.
""But we are committed to doing it and it will be done this winter.""
g problem with the £600 energy support scheme is that it is bogged down in logistics.
It's straightforward when it comes to getting the money out to people who pay their electricity bill by direct debit.
But the difficulty seems to be finding a way to provide the financial help to those people who use pre-paid meters.
government does not want to open a scheme that gets money to some people but not to others.
Other options are being considered.
It would not be a surprise if we see a voucher-style scheme, similar to the High Street Voucher that was rolled out by Stormont during the Covid pandemic.
Gordon Lyons of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said he was worried the scheme would be ""far more complex than the government thinks it is"".
""It could be a real mess - Naomi Long could be right,"" he said.
""My fear is that this actually could take months and months before something like this can be delivered and people need support now.""
Sinn Féin MP John Finucane said people in Northern Ireland would have had the £600 ""in our pockets already had there been an executive in place"".
""As temperatures plummet, as the cost of living gets worse on a weekly basis, we need certainty now from the British government on when we are going to get that payment.""
On Thursday night Mr Sunak met the leaders of Stormont's five main parties.
Political leaders said their meetings with Mr Sunak focused on restoring power-sharing, the stalled energy payment scheme and the nurses' strike.
rime minister continued his first visit to Northern Ireland on Friday by visiting the Harland and Wolff shipyard to promote what Downing Street described as the return of naval shipbuilding to Belfast.
A consortium, including Belfast's Harland and Wolff, was chosen for a £1.6bn Ministry of Defence contract to build three new Royal Navy ships."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63995488
sports	ESports: Welsh video gamers head for Commonwealth Games	"""It's massive. This is an opportunity for eSports to overflow into the mainstream media.""
It is clear John Jackson is looking forward to the Commonwealth eSports Championships taking place in Birmingham this weekend.
Short for electronic sports - it allows people to compete at video games. 
ESports is being piloted at the Commonwealth Games for the first time this year, with the tournament taking place on 6 and 7 August.
Mr Jackson, who is Wales team manager and chief executive of eSports Wales, hopes the event will showcase new talent. 
Peachy Bell, 22, from Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, is part of the team - she has been gaming since 2018 and has completed about 3,000 hours of game time. 
It may sound like a lot, but not when you consider pros have amassed tens of thousands of hours.
""I never though it would be like this. They were like you 'never know one day it might at the Olympics',"" she said. 
""That is so weird. It is a weird concept but it's becoming more normalised now. 
""You used to have events just for eSports and not joining in with more physical activities, it is a bit crazy.
""I think it's definitely a good thing. People judge you when you say 'I want to play this professionally' but if you have things like the Commonwealth behind you, then it becomes a more viable thing that people want to get into professionally.""
Looking to the future, Mr Jackson hopes that the eSports pilot will be a success, and that the sport will become a permanent fixture in the sporting calendar.
""I think it's massive. At the moment this is the first one, the Commonwealth. Hopefully going forward we'll get involved in the Olympics,"" he said. 
He is also known as Slayer John in the eSports world, and believes it is about attracting new players to the sport and giving them something to aim for. 
""It's about building that aspiration, getting players to think they can play for Wales. Like you would have someone doing athletics, and in four years' time, they get to represent their country if they work hard enough. It's a case for having that for the gamers and eSports players and going 'this is the route for us'.
""One of the things with it being a country, and representing your country, it allows a lot of people to get involved, to get behind your team.""
He said it ""Wales, it's England, it's Scotland, it's Ireland"", adding: ""You know these, you've watched the rugby, you've watched the football."""	/news/uk-wales-62437334
technology	Holiday Inn hotels hit by cyber-attack	"Holiday Inn owner, Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG), has confirmed the company has been hit by a cyber-attack.
IHG, which has some of the world's largest hotel chains, issued a statement saying it was investigating ""unauthorised access"" to a number of its technology systems.
UK-based company said its ""booking channels and other applications"" had been disrupted since Monday.
It manages the Holiday Inn, Crowne Plaza and Regent hotels.  
""IHG is working to fully restore all systems as soon as possible,"" the company said.
IHG confirmed it was assessing the nature, extent and impact of the incident and had implemented its response plans, including appointing external specialists to investigate the breach.
mpany is also in the process of notifying regulatory authorities.
In a statement, the company said: ""We will be supporting hotel owners and operators as part of our response to the ongoing service disruption. IHG's hotels are still able to operate and to take reservations directly.""
But many people trying to book accommodation have been complaining.
IHG did not say there had been any loss of customer data. 
It also did not specifically say it was a ransomware attack, but most of the speculation points in that direction.
Last month, a Holiday Inn in Istanbul was breached by LockBit, which released data stolen from the company. 
It is not known if there is a connection between the attacks.
was also the target of a three-month security breach in 2017 when more than 1,200 of its franchised hotels in the US were affected.

business	Charities with a mountain to climb as donors drop	"Charities are facing ""lacklustre"" festive donations as the soaring cost of living hits the finances of organisations and their sponsors.
Fewer people are donating to charity compared with before the pandemic, according to a survey by the Charities Aid Foundation (CAF).
Rising prices and bills mean the money that is donated does not go as far, while demand for services is rising.
One charity boss says it is leading to choices that ""make me cry"".
Lara Bundock, founder and chief executive of The Snowdrop Project, which supports survivors of human trafficking, said it was no longer possible to cover the travel costs of everyone who needed her charity as a safe haven.
ft some people in need questioning whether they could afford the fare to visit Snowdrop, she said.
""The economic climate and cost of living crisis has hit harder than any of us could have imagined,"" she wrote in a message to supporters. ""For the first time in 10 years, I've had to make some hard decisions to keep the charity going.""
She said the charity's outgoings had increased by £10,000 a year, with a sharp increase in the cost of heating and lighting their premises in Sheffield.
rity has cut some of its English language teaching and Ms Bundock, who has climbed Kilimanjaro to fundraise for the charity, said finances were stretched but she was determined to retain experienced, key staff.
""I'm aware, of course, that everyone is struggling. I hope that if you can't donate, then they can share information with others, or companies, who maybe can,"" she told the BBC.
CAF, an advisory group for the charitable sector, said this time of year - particularly November - was usually a key month for donations owing in part to national events such as Remembrance Day.
However, its survey suggested people had fewer opportunities to donate during the pandemic and the number of people donating had failed to pick up this year. That was likely to be the result of the pressure of the rising cost of living, the CAF said.
Some 36% of those asked had donated in the previous four weeks, CAF's November survey showed. This was slightly higher than same month in the previous two years, but down from a 43% average during November in the pre-pandemic years. 
who were donating were giving more than four or six years ago, but that comes at a time when high inflation is eating away at the spending power of those donations.
""People cutting back on their donations during the Christmas period is understandable but it is a concern for the many charities that rely on festive fundraising, especially following two years of cancelled charitable events and appeals,"" said Neil Heslop, chief executive of the Charities Aid Foundation.
""Charities know more than most the pressures people are feeling as they try to provide for their families during this incredibly challenging time.""
CAF said that a third of charities had seen demand for their services increase significantly compared to last year, and people were more aware of those in need in their local communities.
It said people could add to the coffers of charities by declaring their donation so Gift Aid is added. There were also tax-efficient ways of giving directly from pre-tax pay or pensions.
It is also urging people to volunteer their time as an equally valuable way to help."	/news/business-64000793
technology	EU Commission to make it easier to sue over AI products	"European Commission has proposed new rules to help people harmed by products using artificial intelligence (AI) and digital devices like drones.
AI Liability Directive would reduce the burden of proof on people suing over incidents involving such items.
Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders said it would make a legal framework that was fit for the digital age.
Self-driving cars, voice assistants and search engines could all fall under the directive's scope.
If passed, the Commission's rules could run alongside the EU's proposed Artificial Intelligence Act - the first law of its kind to set limits on how and when AI systems can be used.
Artificial intelligence systems are trained on large amounts of data or information to allow machines to perform tasks which would typically be considered a matter of human intelligence. 
Watch: What is artificial intelligence?
AI Liability Directive, published by the European Commission on Wednesday, will introduce a ""presumption of causality"" for those claiming injuries by AI-enabled products.
means victims will not have to untangle complicated AI systems to prove their case, so long as a causal link to a product's AI performance and the associated harm can be shown. 
For a long time, social media firms have hidden behind the caveat that they are merely platforms for other people's stuff and therefore not responsible for the content of it. 
EU does not want to repeat this scenario, with companies which make drones, for example, getting off the hook if they cause harm just because the firm itself wasn't directly behind the controllers.
If your product is set up to be able to cause distress or damage, then you need to take responsibility if it does, is the clear message - and perhaps one which is overdue.
Is this unduly harsh on a comparatively new industry? If a car crashes because of the mechanics inside the vehicle, that's down to the manufacturer. But the behaviour of the driver is not.
Should this draft go through, all eyes will be on the first test case. Europe continues to chase the tail of big tech with big regulation - but is it being realistic here?
According to the European Commission, high-risk use of AI can include infrastructure or products which could directly affect someone's life and livelihood, such as transport, exam-scoring and border control.
Information disclosure about such products will let victims gain more insights into liability, but be subject to safeguards to ""protect sensitive information"". 
While such provisions in the directive could make businesses ""unhappy"", Sarah Cameron, technology legal director at law firm Pinsent Masons, said the rules helped clarify liability for AI-enabled products for consumers and businesses alike. 
""A major barrier to businesses adopting AI has been the complexity, autonomy and opacity (the so-called black box effect) of AI, creating uncertainty around establishing liability and with whom it sits,"" she said. 
""The proposal will ensure that when AI systems are defective and cause physical damage or data loss, it's possible to seek compensation from the AI-system provider or from any manufacturer that integrates an AI system into another product."" "	/news/technology-63033084
health	Speedo Mick set to start final fundraising walk	"A fundraiser famous for walking in his tight blue Everton FC swimming trunks is set to start his last big challenge.
In eight years Michael Cullen, also known as Speedo Mick, has raised more than £800,000 through his challenges.
58-year-old said he hoped his final walk - spanning 1,000 miles (1,600km) from John O'Groats to Land's End - would take the total to more than £1m.
""That would just be a perfect ending to the Speedo Mick stomps, wouldn't it, a million quid?"" Mr Cullen said.
Mick hopes to walk at least 15 miles a day for up to three months in aid of The SpeedoMick Foundation.
rity will give grants to small charities that support mental health awareness, disadvantaged young people, and the homeless.
Mick first earned his nickname after fundraising £30,000 swimming the English Channel in 2014.
wo years later, he raised more than £50,000 for a Liverpool hospice by walking from Everton's Goodison Park stadium to Wembley Stadium.
In 2019 and 2020 he raised more than £300,000 after walking from John O'Groats to Land's End and in 2021 his 2,500 mile (4,023 km) Giving Back Tour raised almost £180,000.
""It's bittersweet,"" he said of his various challenges. ""It's given me a purpose to be busy and to be positive and to give back as well.
""And every single person who's donated, shared my posts, said 'keep going'... every single person who has done that for me over the last eight years, they've all been part of this journey.
Mick, who has previously shared details of his own personal mental health challenges, has said his fundraising was a way to thank people who had helped him.
Speedo Mick spoke to BBC Breakfast about his battle with depression
On his final walk, starting on 29 December, he plans to scale the Britain's three national mountain peaks - Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike, and Mount Snowdon - along the way.
While admitting he was not quite yet feeling up to his last trek, Mick said putting on his Speedos lets him ""get into the groove"".
""I get the energy from them,"" he said.
""When I get in my kit and I've got my bag on and all my flags are flapping about in the wind, that's when the challenge begins.""

business	Credit card borrowing in fastest rise since 2005	"Credit card borrowing in June grew at the fastest rate in nearly 17 years, Bank of England figures show.
Borrowing on credit cards grew at an annual rate of 12.5% -  the fastest pace since November 2005.
Figures from the Bank also showed that consumers cut how much money they set aside for savings last month.
Analysts warned that the increased borrowing and reduced saving suggests that households are struggling to cope with the soaring cost of living.
Prices in the UK are continuing to rise at their fastest rate for more than 40 years, driven by higher petrol and food costs.
UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, is currently at 9.4%. However, wages are not keeping up, with regular pay growing at an annual pace of just 4.3% between March and May, according to the latest official figures.
Bank of England's latest figures showed that while borrowing rose, households deposited an extra £1.5bn with banks and building societies in June, well down on May's total of £5.2bn.
Nicholas Farr, assistant economist at Capital Economics. said: ""The rise in borrowing is probably a sign that households are being forced to turn to credit to support their spending, due to high inflation.
""The £1.5bn rise in cash sitting in households' bank accounts was much smaller than the £5.2bn rise in May and the 2019 average monthly rise of £4.6bn, which suggests that households are also reducing their savings to cope with higher prices.""
figures may just be the ""just the tip of the iceberg"", according to Laura Suter, head of personal finance at AJ Bell.
""Once the energy price cap shifts up again in October and we all use more energy in winter, these [borrowing] figures will keep climbing,"" she said.
""What's more, while some people may still have savings to fall back on now, as they are exhausted more people will have to turn to debt.""
Bank of England figures showed approvals for house purchases, an indicator of future borrowing, decreased to 63,700 in June, from 65,700 in May.
""Overall, June's money and credit data add to signs that higher inflation and higher interest rates are taking their toll on households,"" said Mr Farr. ""With inflation and interest rates only set to rise further, we think the economy will soon slip into a recession."""	/news/business-62344655
health	Care workers paid £8,000 less than NHS equivalents in England - study	"A care worker in England is paid on average £8,000 a year less than NHS staff with the same skills, research for a care provider suggests.  
rity, Community Integrated Care, also told BBC News it was having to provide food parcels for some staff who were struggling to pay their bills. 
Separate research shows low pay is the most common reason why care staff quit.
government said it was ""incredibly grateful"" to carers and recognised their ""extraordinary commitment"".
A spokesperson added: ""That's why we prioritised social care in the Autumn Statement, providing up to £7.5bn over the next two years."" 
Many health professionals are struggling financially, with nurses due to strike over pay for a second time on Tuesday.
However, Community Integrated Care - one of the UK's largest providers of support for people with learning disabilities and autism - says pay pressures facing social care are now ""untenable"" and ""immoral"".
On average, the study found:
research, by job evaluation experts Korn Ferry, found care workers' wages have risen since last year, but the pay gap with the NHS has increased by about £1,000.
Other jobs with similar skill levels, such as senior teaching assistants, are paid an average of £26,327, again significantly more than care workers, Korn Ferry found. 
Mollie Moorby, 23, works with adults with physical and learning disabilities in Stockport, Greater Manchester. ""This is my dream job, helping people,"" Mollie told the BBC. 
She is trained to support people with their daily life, including with their health needs and food. 
Mollie started looking after her own mother as a teenager, and gradually realised she wanted to work in a caring role. However, on £10 an hour she struggles to put food on the table and cannot afford to turn on her heating. 
""When you're working 40 to 50 hours a week and you put in everything, not only physically, but mentally, emotionally - for lack of better words - it doesn't seem fair.""
With the cost-of-living crisis, things became so difficult that Mollie asked her bosses at Community Integrated Care for help. As a result, they started providing food parcels for staff in need, and they have given out more than 80 since September.
""With the food parcels, it has been a lot easier,"" says Mollie. ""You get necessities, things that are expensive, like laundry detergent. That was stressing me out for a while."" 
rity says it has already used its financial reserves to increase wages for Mollie and her colleagues. However, it says it cannot raise them further because it is now running at a loss - as the fees it receives from councils for providing support are not enough.
""We are subsidising the contracts that local authorities are asking us to provide,"" says Teresa Exelby, from the charity. ""We want to do absolutely everything we can, but as a charity that is not sustainable. Fundamentally, the system is absolutely broken."" 
A separate report, published on Monday by the Homecare Association, which represents companies caring for people in their own homes, reaches a similar conclusion, with almost all the firms that responded saying it is harder than ever to recruit and keep staff.
fficial figures, published in October, show 165,000 job vacancies in adult social care in England, up 52% in a year.
Homecare Association study says among staff, the most common reason for leaving is needing to earn more money and more than half say they feel burnt out, stressed or exhausted.
government says its Made With Care recruitment campaign aims to boost careers in adult social care and it is also investing £15m in hiring from overseas. 
In England, the national living wage for over-23s will rise to £10.42 from next April.
In Scotland, care workers have been paid a minimum of £10.50 an hour since April this year, and in Wales, they will be paid at least £10.90 an hour from June 2023."	/news/uk-64025830
business	Russia blames sanctions for gas pipeline shutdown	"Russia has warned that it will not resume gas supplies along a key pipeline to Europe until sanctions are lifted.
Moscow has blamed Western countries for its decision not to reopen the Nord Stream 1 pipeline after it was shut for three days for maintenance.
When asked if supplies would resume pumping if sanctions were eased, a Kremlin spokesman said: ""Definitely"".
Gas prices soared on Monday due to mounting concerns over energy supplies.
Dutch month-ahead wholesale gas price, a benchmark for Europe, was up as much as 30% in early trading on Monday. Prices in the UK rose as much as 35% before winding back to £4.50 per therm.
Wholesale prices have been very volatile in recent weeks. They fell sharply last week when Germany announced that its gas storage facilities were filling up faster than expected.
Europe has accused Russia of using gas supplies to blackmail European countries because of the Ukraine conflict.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday: ""Pumping problems arose because of sanctions imposed against our country and against a number of companies by Western states, including Germany and the UK.
""There are no other reasons that would lead to problems with pumping.""
Last week, state energy firm Gazprom said that an oil leak in a turbine on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline was behind the closure.
But this has been disputed by the European Union and Siemens itself, the German firm which maintains the turbine.
""Such leaks do not normally affect the operation of a turbine and can be sealed on site. It is a routine procedure within the scope of maintenance work,"" Siemens said in a previous statement.
While the UK is not reliant on Nord Stream 1 for its gas, the Kremlin's decision to squeeze supplies to Europe has driven up the overall cost of wholesale gas.
rall increase has been behind the spike in the energy bill price cap for consumers in England, Wales and Scotland.
Mr Peskov criticised European leaders for the surge in bills: ""It is obvious that Europe is getting worse for people, entrepreneurs, companies, to live and work: less money is being earned, the standard of living is falling,"" he said.
Liz Truss, who will become the UK's prime minister on Tuesday, has promised to announce a plan to deal with high energy bills soon after she enters office.
However, UK businesses are not protected by a price cap and, last week, the British Chambers of Commerce warned firms would ""close their doors this winter"" if they were not given support with soaring bills.
Energy expert Bill Farren-Price told the BBC's Today programme that the ""crunch moment"" would come later in the year if demand is particularly high for gas and is going to exceed what can be imported.
He added that looking at action on energy bills would be the top priority for the incoming prime minister. 
A number of European governments have revealed plans to help businesses and consumers cope with surging energy costs. On Sunday, Germany announced a €65bn (£56.2bn) package which includes one-off payments to the most vulnerable and tax breaks to energy-intensive firms. 
Over the weekend, Sweden and Finland also announced multi-billion pound packages to support energy companies.
Other European ministers have accused Russia of using energy supplies as an economic weapon against those supporting Ukraine. Moscow has denied it is deliberately restricting exports in the run-up to winter.
European governments are convinced Russia has weaponised the gas markets, by restricting supplies in order to push up prices. 
makes life harder for businesses and consumers, and tests their own commitment to supporting Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression.
But we know that Russia makes huge sums from exporting oil and gas, so how can it afford to do this, especially when it has a war to pay for?
Well for a start, with prices sky-high, it can make the same amount of money from selling much less gas than would ordinarily be the case.
Secondly, gas sales are much less important to Russia financially than oil exports. But Europe really needs Russian gas, because it has limited alternatives.
So the gamble Moscow may be making is that while turning off the taps could ultimately hit its own revenues, its opponents will suffer a great deal more. 
ue to reopen on Saturday but Gazprom made the announcement on shutting the pipeline on Friday shortly after the G7 nations agreed to cap the price of Russian oil in support of Ukraine.
roduction of a price cap means countries that sign up to the policy will be permitted to purchase only Russian oil and petroleum products transported via sea that are sold at or below the price cap.
But Russia says it will not export to countries that participate in the cap.
Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said that Russia's actions could not only risk leading to a ""war winter"", but could potentially have a knock-on effect on businesses and its wider economy. 
Nord Stream 1 pipeline stretches from the Russian coast near St Petersburg to north-eastern Germany and can carry up to 170 million cubic metres of gas a day.
It is owned and operated by Nord Stream AG, whose majority shareholder is Gazprom.
first time since Russia's invasion of Ukraine that the pipeline has been closed.
In July, Gazprom cut off supplies completely for 10 days, citing ""a maintenance break"". It restarted again 10 days later, but at a much reduced level.
On Monday, the Opec+ group of oil producing nations has announced a small cut to its output at its monthly meeting.
Its members, which includes Russia, said production would be reduced by 100,000 barrels per day in October, reversing an increase the group now says was for September only.
Analysts said the trim - announced following recent falls in crude oil prices - was largely symbolic."	/news/business-62789675

rapper was named Diversity Champion for his efforts to ""level the playing field"" through his charities Merky Foundation and Merky Books.
""I encourage everyone in the room today to not just use diversity as a buzzword,"" he said in his speech.
""Whatever position you're in... let that be a driving factor, and not just see it as a quota or a box to tick.""
Addressing a room full of music industry executives, he stressed ""the worth and the value"" of embracing a wide range of voices in the workplace.
According to the latest figures from UK Music, 22% of people working in the music industry are from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds; while women hold 49.6% of industry roles.
However, career progression for these groups remains sluggish, with representation tailing off in higher age and income brackets. 
Stormzy's Merky Foundation has pledged £10m over 10 years to organisations and charities ""committed to fighting for racial equality, justice reform and black empowerment within the UK"".
It currently supports the Black Heart Foundation, which aims to improve access to education for underprivileged children, and partners with Cambridge University to award £20,000 scholarships to black students.

Soul singer Cleo Sol won best independent album for her thoughtful, intimate album Mother, which juxtaposes her feelings about becoming a new mother with the turbulent relationship she had with her own family.
Indie duo Wet Leg, whose debut album is up for this year's Mercury Prize, won best breakthrough; while their fellow Mercury nominees Nova Twins won best track for the defiantly raucous Antagonist.
US singer Mitski, who supported Harry Styles on his UK tour this summer, was named best live performer, while pop alchemist Rina Sawayama took home the innovation award.
Up-and-coming artist Nia Archives was crowned this year's ""one to watch"", as she spearheads a revival in the jungle scene.
And London singer-songwriter Nilufer Yanya won the BBC 6 Music ""difficult second album"" prize for her critically-acclaimed record, Painless.
winners' trophies all carried the symbol for Autistic Pride Day, as part of AIM's own commitment to diversity.

redundancies, announced by the entertainment giant on Tuesday, will mainly affect its US office in California. They account for about 2% of its North American workforce.
Netflix said the job losses were due to the slump in the company's revenue.
reaming service is battling an exodus of viewers this year.
""These changes are primarily driven by business needs rather than individual performance, which makes them especially tough as none of us want to say goodbye to such great colleagues,"" the company said in a statement.
It wasn't disclosed which parts of the business would see job losses, but the Los Angeles Times reported that recruiting, communications and also the content department were all affected.
Some people also disclosed their job loss online.
In April, the streaming giant shocked the industry when it revealed it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the first three months of 2022, and warned another two million were expected to quit in the coming quarter.
ws sparked an investor sell-off, with the firm's stock plunging 35% in one day. It is now trading at $190 (£152), a 46% drop on its previous premium.
While Netflix has 220 million subscribers globally and remains the clear market leader, it has faced fierce competition in recent years with the arrival of competitor platforms such as Disney Plus, HBO, and Amazon's Prime Video.
In its earnings report last month, the company also said the war in Ukraine and the decision to raise its prices in the US had cost it subscribers. 
Pulling out of the Russian market alone had cost the service 700,000 members, it revealed.
Along with job losses, the company is also cutting content and pulling back on its own creations. Earlier in May it cancelled development of Pearl, an animated series created by Meghan Markle, in its move to cut costs.
Some analysts say that after a surge in sign-ups during the pandemic, Netflix has run out of easy ways to grow the business.
mpany says it's looking at a cheaper, ad-based model and also planning on cracking down on password sharing which has cost it 100 million households.
Netflix is not alone in making job cuts. In recent weeks, a slew of US tech companies from start-ups to big names such as Uber and Twitter have said they are slowing or freezing hiring, or, like online car sales firm Carvana, announced redundancies, citing a downturn.

business	Government must help with energy costs, businesses say	"Businesses in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire have said the government ""must step in"" and help with soaring energy costs or firms will go bust.
Ofgem has announced the average household energy bill will hit £3,549 from 1 October but businesses are not covered by a price cap.
Fish merchant Nathan Godley said his bill would more than quadruple from £21,000 to £91,000 later this year.
government has been contacted for a comment.
Mr Godley, who owns Premier Seafoods in Grimsby, said it would be ""very difficult"" to manage without government help.
""If I could magic an extra £70,000 out of the air I would have done it last year and had some fancy holidays,"" he said.
Mr Godley's business uses a number of walk-in refrigeration and freezing units, and displays need to be left on 24 hours a day. 
He said he was facing pressure to pass on the costs to customers.
""If you do put the prices up too much then you're alienating the customers [who] have got bills to pay as well,"" he told the BBC.
""Without help, without the government stepping in and helping us independent, small businesses, then there will be trouble ahead.""
Independent retailer Debra Pye, who owns an antiques shop in Hull, said she had been forced to take some of the lightbulbs out of her premises to cut costs. 
She told the Local Democracy Reporting Service pressure was mounting on small businesses like hers because customers were scaling back on ""small luxuries"" amid rocketing living costs.
""Rising costs are affecting our customers as well. If you asked any other business they'd tell you the same thing.""
Ms Pye said other local businesses had recently closed.
""I don't think things have been this bad since at least around the time of the miners' strike in the 1980s,"" she said. 
""The big retailers will be fine, it's the small guys like us who will suffer."" 
Lucy Wilkinson, who runs a tanning studio in Lincoln, said her annual energy prices had increased from £18,500 to £73,000.
£54,500 hike resulted in two of her staff being made redundant in order to keep the business going.
Ms Wilkinson said a third of her income was going to be spent on electricity, leaving her no choice but to pass on the increase to her customers from September.
""I feel awful about my girls. I'm very scared. Are we going to lose customers? Yes probably,"" she added. 
""I'm going to have to make cutbacks. I want to survive, being 18 years in the business, but I don't know if we can.""

technology	Elon Musk set to become number-one influencer on Twitter	"uesday, 17 January 2023 is the day analysts predict Elon Musk will become the number-one influencer on Twitter.
With 120 million followers, his account, @ElonMusk, is already the second most followed, after @BarackObama, the former US president's, which has 130 million.
And following a meteoric rise in the month since he bought Twitter, Mr Musk's will inevitably overtake, statisticians at Social Blade say. 
will be an unprecedented moment.
-media industry has never before seen a platform with a chief executive who is also its biggest personality.
So if Mr Musk is to become both Twitter's chief executive and its ""chief influencer"", what are the implications - for the billionaire and for the website? 
BBC News has asked experts for their thoughts on three key statistics.
In spite of recent controversies, Mr Musk's popularity on Twitter is undeniable and growing. 
Over the past 12 months, he has gained 268,303 followers a day, on average, according to Social Blade, and lost followers on only five days, which can all be linked to news events.
He lost nearly 200,000 on 12 November, when major job cuts were announced at Twitter - and as he is likely to have gained new followers that day too, the actual number who unfollowed him must have been much higher.
""Elon Musk is now the main character on Twitter,"" social-media commentator Matt Navarra says.
""In some ways, having a CEO who is a major influencer on the platform has some advantages because it makes him very accessible to people.""
Very few social-media chief executives are major influencers on their own websites.
Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is also a celebrity - but not an active poster on Facebook, Mr Navarra says, and his posts are more corporate in tone.
witter being inextricably linked to Mr Musk - a divisive character - could be a problem for Twitter.
""He is very antagonistic and inflammatory and, some might even say, quite toxic,"" Mr Navarra says. ""And for brands, he might be seen as potentially very dangerous.""
Emerging-technology consultant Kate Baucherel says: ""Wrapping the personality of the CEO into the personality of the platform compromises any neutrality or diversity. A white male US-resident does not represent the world."" 
Already a prolific tweeter, Mr Musk has been posting 84% more often since buying the platform, according to Social Blade. 
On Tuesday, 22 November, he fired off 75 separate tweets, either as posts, replies or retweets. This is a record for him. 
""It's great to have a CEO who uses the product,"" a former senior product manager at Twitter, who wishes to remain anonymous, says.
And it should not impede Mr Musk's direction of the company.
But he says: ""I think people who tweet a lot are addicted - and possibly narcissistic. No single person has enough interesting things to say to the entire world to tweet more than five times a day.""
On average Mr Musk is now tweeting once every 15 minutes during normal waking hours. 
xperts we spoke to all agreed that having a CEO immersed in his or her platform can be a good thing but all agreed that the type of content Mr Musk is posting could be problematic.
Recent tweets have included sexual imagery and swearing. And, responding to critics saying he was killing Twitter, he posted an adaptation of a meme of a man smiling and swearing at a graveside during a funeral.
Mr Navarra says Mr Musk is a huge engagement driver for Twitter and his recent tweets have brought in a significant number of new users or reactivated old ones.
""We only have to look back to another character that shares an alarming amount of similarities... with Elon Musk, which is Donald Trump,"" he says. 
""Trump was also a huge driver of activity and engagement from his tweets and I'm sure that was a benefit to Twitter.
""But I would also say he's probably a net negative in terms of the problems it brought with it for content moderation and toxic content. 
""Elon Musk is having a similar effect on the platform.""
witter permanently suspended President Trump after the storming of the US Capitol building, in Washington, in January 2021, citing ""the risk of further incitement of violence"". 
Mr Musk reinstated his account on 19 November, following a poll of Twitter users, though Mr Trump has not subsequently tweeted.
While gaining 8.6 million followers since buying Twitter, Mr Musk himself has followed only six new people in that time - bringing the total he follows to 129.
witter founder Jack Dorsey followed about 3,500 people when he was chief executive. Former president Barack Obama follows 570,000. 
And commentators say following so few limits Mr Musk's view of what people are talking about on the social network
""He has no idea what the experience of normal users is,"" the former Twitter manager says.
""For example, he never sees ads - because we limit advertising served to the top 1,000 or so users. So he wouldn't have understood that part of the product before he bought it.""
Mr Musk reportedly told Twitter's marketing team adverts should ""look like tweets"", when the company's ads already were tweets.
former Twitter manager also says Mr Musk's skewed experience on the site as a top influencer may prevent him understanding how to improve it and grow it. 
witter is smaller than other social networks and ""average time spent was a severe constraint to our growth and ads business"". 
""People who are committed users spend a lot of time on the site - but they need to find a way to increase the time that the masses spend,"" the former Twitter insider says.
Every time Mr Musk logs into his account, he is greeted with notifications making him feel good and want to stay on the site. 
But for most users, this is not the case.
Growing the number of Twitter users to a billion is one of Mr Musk's key goals.
Now, there are about 300 million - which, at the current rate, is the number of followers Mr Musk himself will have in two years' time, according to Social Blade projections."	/news/technology-63751515
politics	Boris Johnson pulls out of leadership race: Statement in full	"Boris Johnson has ruled himself out of the race to be the next Conservative Party leader and prime minister. Here is his statement in full:
In the last few days I have been overwhelmed by the number of people who suggested that I should once again contest the Conservative Party leadership, both among the public and among friends and colleagues in Parliament.
I have been attracted because I led our party into a massive election victory less than three years ago - and I believe I am therefore uniquely placed to avert a general election now.
A general election would be a further disastrous distraction just when the Government must focus on the economic pressures faced by families across the country.
I believe I am well placed to deliver a Conservative victory in 2024 - and tonight I can confirm that I have cleared the very high hurdle of 102 nominations, including a proposer and a seconder, and I could put my nomination in tomorrow.
re is a very good chance that I would be successful in the election with Conservative Party members - and that I could indeed be back in Downing Street on Friday.
But in the course of the last days I have sadly come to the conclusion that this would simply not be the right thing to do. You can't govern effectively unless you have a united party in parliament.
And though I have reached out to both Rishi (Sunak) and Penny (Mordaunt) - because I hoped that we could come together in the national interest - we have sadly not been able to work out a way of doing this.
refore I am afraid the best thing is that I do not allow my nomination to go forward and commit my support to whoever succeeds.
I believe I have much to offer but I am afraid that this is simply not the right time."	/news/uk-politics-63368973
politics	Suspended Tory MP David Warburton breached code of conduct	"An MP breached Parliament's code of conduct over a £150,000 loan from a Russian-born businessman, a watchdog has ruled.
David Warburton failed to declare a loan given to him by Roman Joukovski via an off-shore trust while lobbying for the businessman.
He will avoid punishment after apologising for breaking the rules.
Mr Warburton lost the Conservative party whip in April after he was accused of sexual misconduct.
He previously told the BBC he had done nothing wrong.
An investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found Mr Warburton received the loan from a foundation based in the Seychelles linked to Mr Joukovski on August 2017.  
Mr Warburton said the money was a commercial loan provided on ""non-preferential terms"", which he paid back by March 2022.
Mr Warburton told the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, that he did not register the loan at the time because it was ""entirely unconnected with either my role as an MP or any parliamentary activities"".
""in no way"" ever ""influenced my words or actions as a Member"" he added in his submission to the commissioner.
After taking the loan, Mr Warburton wrote to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), urging the regulator to reconsider its assessment of Mr Joukovski after refusing to certify him as a fit or proper person.
Ms Stone said she was satisfied the loan had ""not influenced"" Mr Warburton words or actions as an MP - but ruled that it should still have been declared in the register of members' interests.
She found there had been two breaches of the MPs Code of Conduct. But the breaches were rectified after Mr Warburton wrote to the commissioner ""acknowledging and apologising for the breach"", Ms Stone ruled.
He has also agreed to add the loan to the MPs Register of Financial Interests.
Mr Warburton, who is 57, was first elected as the MP for Somerton and Frome in 2015."	/news/uk-politics-63706016
health	Yorkshire ambulance bosses declare critical incident amid delays	"Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) has declared a critical incident as soaring demand sees people face ""significant delays"" waiting for ambulances.
People are being urged to only call 999 in life-threatening emergencies.
move comes as nurses in West Yorkshire hold their second day of industrial action, and the day before ambulance staff are set to go out on strike in England and Wales over pay.
Ambulances have also faced long delays handing over patients at hospitals.
In a statement, YAS said declaring a critical incident would allow it to ""protect our core services for patients and respond to ongoing demand"".
rvice across the country is likely to be hit by major disruption as ambulance workers, including paramedics, control room workers and technicians walk out in England and Wales on Wednesday. 
More than 4,000 ambulance workers are expected to walk out in Yorkshire in the ongoing pay dispute.
YAS executive director Nick Smith said: ""Services will be severely disrupted, with the likelihood of significant delays.  
""So, we are urging the public to use the emergency ambulance service more wisely and only to call 999 when someone is in a life-threatening or very serious condition as we prioritise our response to those most in need.""
Although ambulances will still respond to life-threatening emergencies, other calls will not be answered and people could be asked to make their own way to hospital.
Health service bosses from the NHS Confederation have already said they ""cannot guarantee patient safety"" during the ambulance workers' strike, while Health Minister Will Quince has told people to avoid contact sports and other ""risky activities"" during the strike.

politics	Menai Bridge: Immediate closure for Anglesey crossing	"One of two bridges linking Anglesey and the north Wales mainland has shut suddenly over ""serious"" safety risks.
200-year-old Menai Bridge - the first in the world of its kind - closed at 14:00 BST on Welsh government orders. It was publicly announced five minutes afterwards.
work means it may be shut until next year, with vehicles diverted to the nearby Britannia Bridge.
Local businesses warned of ""nightmare"" traffic problems as a result.
Senedd Member said he was ""very concerned"", and councillors have met Anglesey council's chief executive Dylan Williams to discuss the situation.
Structural engineers recommended that the bridge close to all traffic, including pedestrian and cyclists, to allow essential maintenance work. 
However, it has since reopened for walkers on footpaths and cyclists who dismount their bikes, with marshals set to be in place to monitor numbers.
It remains unclear how long the bridge will be closed but, if required, officials said hanger strengthening works could take up to 16 weeks.
Welsh government instructed its roads agency Traffic Wales to implement the closure. The announcement came in an email to media organisations at 14:05 BST on Friday which said in part: ""This will take effect from 14:00 on Friday 21 October"""".
As part of UK Highways A55 maintenance of the bridge, it was identified that further testing would need to be carried out, alongside the replacement of some of the hangers.
Welsh government said ""serious risks"" have been identified and these findings are currently being reviewed which could take up to two weeks. 
It added that available options to reopen the bridge as soon as possible are being actively assessed.
In addition, further strategies to increase resilience on the Britannia Bridge are being worked on, to reduce the risk of both bridges being closed. 
However, the impact is already of concern to people living and working in the area. 
raffic early on Friday evening was backed up about 1.6 miles (2.5km) almost to upper Bangor, and one driver said it took him two-and-a-half hours to make that journey. 
A 30mph speed limit was also put in place on the bridge due to high winds.
Member of the Senedd (MS) for Ynys Môn, Rhun ap Iorwerth, was ""very concerned"", and ""will be seeking more information and sharing when I can"". 
""This is why we need to build more resilience by dualling the Britannia crossing,"" he said. 
Businesses have spoken out about the consequences for them and warned visiting customers to plan ahead, as traffic builds on the Britannia Bridge.
Steph Rielly, company secretary at T and V Haulage, Y Felinheli, said: ""It's going to be a massive inconvenience. Basically all of our trucks go over Britannia Bridge two or three times a day.
""One driver left 40 minutes ago, it's five minutes away and he still hasn't got over the bridge because of the traffic.
""It's appalling they haven't given us notice. [Our drivers] are going to run out of time and there's literally nowhere for these trucks to park up. 
""The trucks and lorries are going to be everywhere - it's going to be a massive nightmare.""
Kerry Jones, of Cefni Barber Shop in Llangefni said she has had customers phoning to say they have been stuck in the traffic for more than 90 minutes.
She said: ""It's bumper to bumper. People are ringing to say there's a possibility [they] might not make it. 
""It's going to be horrendous - when they closed the bridge last time due to a bad accident we couldn't even get to work.
""Hopefully plans get approved for a third lane or a third bridge.""
Road traffic cameras captured mounting queues on the A55 on Friday evening.
Menai Bridge is widely considered to be the world's first modern suspension bridge.
Its 200th anniversary was marked in 2019 with a programme of events.
In 1819 civil engineer Thomas Telford began working on improving the journey between London and Holyhead, and designed the bridge.
Construction started that year but was not finished until January 1826.
A spokesperson for UK Highways A55 said: ""While this issue will cause disruption, we must act in the interest of public safety. We are currently peer reviewing the findings that led to the recommendation of closure and assessing all available options to reopen the bridge as soon as possible."" 
Deputy Minister for Climate Change Lee Waters added: ""This urgent work is being carried out for public safety, unfortunately it is unavoidable, but we are fully aware of the implication this will have for people in the local area.
""We are working closely with UK Highways to ensure this work is carried out safely and as quickly as possible with minimal disruption to the local community."""	/news/uk-wales-63348053
business	Spanish airline reserves 10 Airlander airships from Bedford-based firm	"mpany behind the Airlander airships said it has received its first commercial order from an airline group.
Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV) said European-based Air Nostrum Group had reserved 10 Airlander airships for delivery from 2026. 
HAV, which developed Airlander at Cardington airfield in Bedfordshire, is expected to begin manufacturing in South Yorkshire.
firm said 1,800 jobs would be created as a result of the interest.
HAV said Airlander 10 will cut flight emissions by up to 90% for journeys across Air Nostrum's regional routes in Spain.
rships, which stay aloft using helium and electricity, have been commissioned to seat 100 people.
According to HAV's website, hybrid aircraft fly due to a combination of aerodynamic lift (like an aeroplane), lifting gases (like an airship) and vectored thrust (similar to a helicopter).
Airlander generates up to 40% of its lift from aerodynamics by the passage of air over the hull and the remainder from buoyant lift from the helium.
Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng said: ""Hybrid aircraft could play an important role as we transition to cleaner forms of aviation, and it is wonderful to see the UK right at the forefront of the technology's development.""
Carlos Bertomeu, Air Nostrum's president, said: ""We are exploring each and every possible way to reduce our carbon footprint. 
""The Airlander 10 will drastically reduce emissions and for that reason we have made this agreement with HAV. 
""Sustainability, which is good news for everyone, is already a non-negotiable fact in the daily operations of commercial aviation.""
m Grundy, chief executive officer of Hybrid Air Vehicles, said: ""Our partnership with Air Nostrum Group, as the launch airline for Airlander 10, leads the way towards that future. 
""As countries like France, Denmark, Norway, Spain and the UK begin to put in place ambitious mandates for the decarbonisation of domestic and short haul flight, Hybrid Air Vehicles and Air Nostrum Group are demonstrating how we can get there - and get there soon.""

health	Patients have to leave Dumfries and Galloway to find NHS dentist	"A health board has said thousands of people will have to leave its area to try to find an NHS dentist.
It comes after a dental practice in Dumfries confirmed plans to deregister more than 5,000 patients.
No other dentists in Dumfries and Galloway are accepting new NHS registrations, meaning they will have to go private or go elsewhere.
Director of public health Valerie White said the situation was one of ""significant concern"".
Blue Door dental practice is the latest in a string of similar issues across south-west Scotland.
Last month, a practice in Thornhill wrote to patients telling them it no longer intended to provide NHS services.
Similar steps were announced in Castle Douglas in October.
rd confirmed that the alternatives facing patients without an NHS dentist were now to ""secure registration outwith the region or access dental care privately"".
Paul Davies is among those affected by the decision of the Blue Door practice in Dumfries to deregister thousands of patients in March next year.
He has been trying to get an appointment since the summer - one was cancelled due to the Queen's funeral and another a week before he was due to be seen.
""In frustration I emailed the practice manager and was told that all NHS appointments were being cancelled as the practice was leaving the NHS for most treatments,"" he said.
""I have been unable to find a NHS dentist in Dumfries.
""Amazingly the pain I have been experiencing has reduced but I do have a broken tooth and some discomfort.""
He said he hoped not to wait until March to be deregistered.
""I intend to speak to Blue Door about leaving and then find a dentist outside of Dumfries and Galloway,"" he said.
Ms White said:  ""We continue work to encourage and support dentists to provide NHS general dental services and are working closely with Scottish government colleagues on these matters.
""However, lack of dentists coming to work in the region is a key issue, and challenges in dental workforce are being seen across the UK.""
Anyone who is not registered with a dentist and requires emergency dental care can access it by contacting the dental helpline on 0845 602 6417.
A Scottish government statement said: ""We understand that in certain remote and rural areas, NHS dental access is challenging - a historical position exacerbated by Brexit controls, as well as the unique difficulties following the pandemic.
""We have put in place additional recruitment and retention incentives to maximise the opportunities for newly qualified dentists to work in areas such as Dumfries and Galloway.""

sports	Chinese outcry after volleyballers wear N95 masks during match	"A volleyball match which saw China's national women's team compete while wearing N95 masks has caused a stir on Chinese social media. 
Many netizens expressed their anger, suggesting that the health of players was being sacrificed for the sake of the country's zero-Covid strategy. 
rs later took their masks off for the second set and went on to win.
China's Volleyball Association later apologised, saying the decision was made was due to a ""lack of experience"".
But many remained critical, with one saying it was an example of officials taking China's mask mandate ""too far"". 
""Our leaders are... taking things too far - it's as simple as that,"" one user wrote.
k place on Thursday at the Asian Cup in the Philippines and saw the Chinese team go up against Iran.
Photos from the match, showing the athletes with their masks on, quickly circulated on social media - triggering an uncommon outpouring of criticism online, with more than 16 million views on the topic on Weibo, China's largest social media platform.
One Weibo comment wrote: ""Is health or performance more important? We need to take some responsibility towards our athletes.""
Another said: ""How long will this so-called epidemic prevention farce continue? Do we want to become the butt of all other countries' jokes?""
fury online prompted the Chinese Volleyball Association to respond on Thursday with a public apology.
In a statement on Weibo, it explained that team organisers prior to the game had learnt of Covid- infected players in other teams and said some symptoms had been reported among Chinese team members.  
revent the spread, they required their players wear masks upon entering the venue. But because they were unclear on whether players had to wear masks on court, the team kept them on during the first half, they said. 
After losing the first set, most players later took their masks off during half-time - and later won 3-1 against Iran. 
""After realising that playing with a mask is not good for the health of the players, the team reminded us in time [so] that our players took off the masks and finished the next game,"" the organisers said.
ment also made reference to the new ""difficulties"" faced by Chinese teams competing abroad - whose members largely have not previously been exposed to Covid.
China continues to employ some of the strictest Covid restrictions in the world including an indoor and outdoor mask mandate, severe, sudden lockdowns and closed borders.
However, this is not the first time athletes have worn masks during sports matches.
Earlier this year, an ice hockey  match between Canada and the Russian Olympic Committee saw both sides wear masks, due to ""safety and security concerns"" over pending test results.

business	CEO Secrets: What's a modern boss to wear?	"A new culture of working from home and video conferencing has ushered in a trend for informality in the workplace, including what we wear. CEOs set the tone for their companies. So can they now dress down a bit?
""Our post-pandemic lifestyle has taught me that I don't need to dress smartly for work every day,"" says Louise O'Shea, CEO of insurance comparison site Confused.com, ""especially when we've all seen each other's realities when working from home.
""But I do it because I enjoy it,"" she adds. ""And putting on some of my best workwear and doing my hair and makeup before each working day has become a sort of personal ritual for me, allowing me to go from one state of mind to another and putting my 'best self' forward.""
Fiona Gordon of advertising agency Ogilvy UK agrees. ""I think CEOs can definitely be more informal than they were,"" she says.
""The pandemic has moved the dress code for everyone. But for me personally, if I'm going to present to a big room, I like to feel the energy and I do get that from what I wear.
""For example, putting lipstick on is one of my personal triggers for confidence.""
women are just two of the many CEOs now facing a wardrobe dilemma. How do you present yourself to be taken seriously for business in a world that seems much more open to informality? Are those in charge ready to change their wardrobes, in line with their workforce?
Peter Done, CEO of Manchester-based HR specialists Peninsula, isn't ready to mothball his suit just yet. 
""I wear a suit to the office every day,"" he says. ""This conveys a certain standard that I have set for myself, both personally and professionally. As CEO, it's up to me to lead by example. If I expect employees to dress smartly then I should do the same."" 
While acknowledging that the pandemic has changed expectations, allowing employees to dress in a more casual style that used to be associated with the tech sector, Done believes that dressing professionally puts you in a better frame of mind for work.
""I believe it is good business practice to dress smartly,"" he adds. ""It all comes back to customer service, leaving people with a good impression, showing that you care and want them to come back. 
""If someone were to turn up to a meeting in ripped jeans or flip flops - unless it were out of hours and very last minute - to me that shows you don't care. First impressions count and you only get one chance to make a good one.""
mic has accelerated the level of informality that companies accept, according to Ben Whitter, head of employee coaching and consultancy firm HEX Organization. 
CEOs want to appear to be more human and not just some corporate robot in a suit, he says. ""Someone that people feel comfortable around, is relatable, and we can have confidence in.""
He also argues that (at least for men) the suit and tie combination was becoming a tainted brand well before the pandemic, thanks to a whole series of high-profile stories like the MPs' expenses scandal, the Enron collapse, and the 2007-08 banking crisis. 
""It's no longer taken for granted that the suit is the uniform of a trustworthy person,"" he says.
But Peter Done refutes this. ""Suits don't make any difference, it's the credibility of the individual that counts,"" he counters.
So what should a leader who wants to be seen as relatable and authentic wear?
recruit to the TV show Dragons' Den, Steven Bartlett, vowed when he became a panellist that he would never wear a suit.  
He says he wants to represent a new breed of young business leader that is true to himself and doesn't stand on ceremony.   
CEO's role, and the expectations placed on them, can vary a lot depending on the size of the company. This too might affect their choice of clothing.
Bosses of smaller start-ups don't usually feel the need to stand out from their team, but they do need to impress and quickly build trust with potential new clients and investors.
Joel Remy-Parkes has turned a successful side hustle selling kids' tableware into a growing small business.
He works out of a large co-working space where you will struggle to find anyone wearing a suit and tie.
""The lockdown almost stripped everyone down to their comfort essentials and we all began to discover a new level of appropriate dress code,"" he says.
It's a development he welcomes, but it poses a dilemma when he is getting ready to meet new people.
""If I had to meet an investor or potential partner, I would honestly feel a little odd rocking up in my Wu-Tang T-shirt. But on the flip side, I would be absolutely delighted if she was wearing one too!""
move to informal dressing at the top may sound liberating, but is it an equal one across the gender divide?
Some argue that it is easer for male CEOs to adopt this new informal style.
""The pressures for women are extremely high,"" says Confused.com's Louise O'Shea. 
""Quite often when I do broadcast interviews, comments are made about my appearance, particularly my hair. While this might not seem like anything major, it's led me to have conversations with my male counterparts on whether this would ever happen to them. 
""Guess what? It hasn't.""  
She adds: ""I do often wonder what the reaction would be if I appeared live on TV without brushing my hair or doing my makeup. Would I be known as the CEO who never made an effort, or the CEO who was ready to challenge old expectations?"" 
But not everyone agrees that the odds are stacked against women in this regard.
Fiona Gordon of Ogilvy UK thinks this shift to casual could present some unexpected positives for women. ""Women, you could argue, will have more opportunities than men because women traditionally can wear more diverse clothes so can be more expressive of themselves, whereas for men there is a kind of uniform in a way. 
""It is quite good to be memorable. People's attention is satiated with so many images,"" she adds. 
Sara Simmonds, a former fashion entrepreneur who now coaches CEOs across different sectors, believes women and men are judged equally in terms of style and appearance.
""We only want to do business with those we trust, and that first impression comes from what you wear and how you present yourself, no matter your gender,"" she says.
Whether you choose to dress formally or casually, you still need to pay close attention to what you wear, she says.
""Informal dressing can set your clients at ease, but first impressions still count. Jeans that fit well, trainers that are clean, and T-shirts that are crisp are essential. And you should add something to this that is your signature touch, you need to have a style and stick with it. 
""Your clothes are a silent sales weapon.""

technology	Technoblade: Minecraft YouTuber dies from cancer aged 23	"Minecraft YouTuber Technoblade has died aged 23, his family have confirmed in an emotional farewell video posted on his behalf.
, entitled ""so long nerds"" and posted to his 10 million followers, showed his father calling him ""the most amazing kid anyone could ever ask for"".
US internet personality rose to fame livestreaming and posting clips of himself playing the sandbox video game.

health	Neglect at Margate hospital contributed to death of doctor of 45 years, coroner says	"Neglect at an understaffed hospital contributed to the death of a doctor with 45 years' service, a coroner said. 
Dr David Gordon-Nesbitt, 84, was admitted to the Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother Hospital in Margate on 21 October 2021 with a bowel obstruction.
A tube used to put dye into his stomach was clamped while an X-ray was taken, but was not unclamped afterwards. 
gestive juices were unable to drain away and his lungs filled with fluid.
He then developed sepsis and had a cardiac arrest, the family's lawyer said.
Dr Gordon-Nesbitt, a retired paediatrician, had an X-ray at 21:00 BST on 23 October and was returned to the ward.
North East Kent assistant coroner, Catherine Wood, told an inquest at Maidstone: ""The night shift on the ward he was on were short of qualified staff and there was no nurse in charge.""
Dr Gordon-Nesbitt started vomiting just after 01:00 but despite medical treatment he died at 04:00 BST the next day, the coroner said. 
""He died as a consequence of an acute aspiration of his gastric contents as a result of a bowel obstruction and contributed to by neglect,"" Ms Wood concluded. 
His daughter, Rebecca Gordon-Nesbitt, said: ""Dad was in really good health for a man his age. 
""There were too few experienced nursing staff available to work, and a dreadful mistake was made in his care.
""My father gave 45 years of his working life working for the NHS. It is horrifying that he should die like this.""
family's solicitor, Frankie Rhodes from Leigh Day, said: ""A finding of neglect in a case such as this is extremely rare.""
Sarah Shingler, executive chief nursing and midwifery officer for East Kent Hospitals, said: ""We apologise unreservedly to Mr Gordon-Nesbitt's family for the failings in his care.  
""We fully accept the findings and conclusion of the coroner and have employed more nurses, increased leadership support on each shift, and strengthened patient safety procedures on the ward.""

politics	Suella Braverman: We have failed to control our borders	"Suella Braverman blames the ""people smugglers"" and ""people coming here illegally"" over Channel boats crossings.
Home Secretary Suella Braverman has admitted the UK government has failed to control its borders, blaming migrants and people smugglers for chaos at Kent's Manston processing centre. 
However, she also said the Home Office needed to improve its efficiency.
MPs heard the home secretary had been warned four times keeping migrants at Manston may be breaking the law.
Previous reports suggested Ms Braverman was told failing to provide alternative accommodation was in breach of the law.
Ms Braverman told the Home Affairs Select Committee she would not comment on leaked documents. 
However, she said she was aware from September Manston had a problem.
During the committee session, Ms Braverman struggled to reply to a question from Conservative MP Tim Loughton who asked what legal routes were available to refugees who are not part of the Ukraine, Hong Kong or Afghanistan relocation schemes. 
""If you are able to get to the UK, you're able to put in an application for asylum,"" said Ms Braverman. 
Mr Loughton responded that for some refugees, illegal entry was the only way to get to the UK. 
""I think the point is that there's a shortage of safe and legal routes other than for specific groups of people,"" he said.
What safe and legal routes are there to the UK?
Manston was designed as a holding site for a maximum of 1,600 migrants who arrive on small boats - each for a maximum of 24 hours - but at its peak there were 4,000 people there. 
In October, inspectors found families who had been sleeping on mats in the marquees for weeks. 
A man who became unwell while staying at the centre died in hospital on Saturday. He is believed to have crossed to the UK in a small boat earlier in November, and Home Office staff are trying to contact his family. 
On Tuesday, the Home Office confirmed the site had been cleared, helped by bad weather in the English Channel causing a sustained fall in the number of crossings.
Delays in processing asylum claims are taking their toll on refugees' mental health. 
Ubed, an Iraqi Kurd, arrived in the UK by boat 17 months ago with his wife and daughter and claimed asylum in the first few months, but has heard nothing since. 
family is living in one room in a Wakefield hostel while they wait for a Home Office response to their case. 
""When I first came to the UK I was happy. I arrived and felt safe. Since that time it's got worse. My mental health and my family's mental health is degrading,"" Ubed told the BBC.
Dame Diana Johnson, who chairs the select committee, said Ms Braverman was told on 15 and 22 September and 1 and 4 October that the Home Office did not have the power to detain migrants waiting for onward accommodation.
mmittee heard that 36 people who had been held in Manston had been returned to Albania, under the government's agreement to return migrants and offenders.
ut of 12,000 Albanians arriving in the UK this year, up from 800 last year and 50 in 2020, according to official figures. 
Dan O'Mahoney, the Home Office's clandestine channel threat commander, also said there was one Albanian police officer working with officials at the Kent camp.
ry MP Lee Anderson told Ms Braverman more asylum seekers are being housed in hotels because ""the Home Office has failed to control our borders and it's not fit for purpose at the moment"". 
Ms Braverman said: ""We have failed to control our borders, yes, and that's why the prime minister and myself are absolutely determined to fix this problem.""
Earlier Ms Braverman told MPs: ""I am very clear who's at fault. 
""It's the people coming here illegally, people smugglers, people who are choosing to take an illegal and dangerous journey to come here for economic reasons.""
me secretary is aiming to quadruple the rate at which asylum cases are processed by staff as the government attempts to tackle the backlog in the system.
Ms Braverman told the committee that, on average, each staff member was deciding one asylum case per week at present.
Home Office has doubled the number of asylum staff to more than 1,000 and plans to recruit another 500 decision-makers by March.
Ms Braverman said: ""We want to deliver sustainable changes to reach a minimum of three decisions, per decision maker, per week by May."" 
mbition is four decisions per week, she added.
Ms Braverman was also pushed by MPs on the government's policy to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda in a bid to reduce the numbers crossing the Channel. 
, under which the UK has paid Rwanda £140m, is currently on hold as it faces a legal challenge in the court. 
me secretary insisted she still had confidence in the scheme and believed the courts would rule it to be legal.
Matthew Rycroft, the most senior civil servant in the Home Office, said it did not yet have evidence the scheme would be value for money. 
Responding to the issue of the lack of safe and legal routes into the UK, a Home Office official said the UK had offered asylum to more than 380,000 people since 2015, including those from Hong Kong, Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine. 
fficial outlined other legal routes for people from other countries. 
""Our UK Resettlement, Community Sponsorship and Mandate schemes are accessible to refugees who have been assessed for resettlement by the UNHCR, and we do not seek to influence which cases are referred to us,"" said a statement."	/news/uk-politics-63730054
health	Long Covid: What's changed, and what we know now	"More than two million people in the UK say they have symptoms of long Covid, according to the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey.
Many long Covid patients now report Omicron was their first infection - and I'm one of them.
But almost three years into the pandemic there is still a struggle to be seen by specialist clinics, which are hampered by a lack of resources and research.
Has the condition changed at all, and have treatments started to progress?
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence defines long Covid, or post-Covid syndrome, as symptoms during or after infection that continue for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. 
An estimated 1.2m of those who answered the ONS survey reported at least one such symptom continuing for more than 12 weeks - health issues that they didn't think could be explained by anything else.
It's easy to assume that new cases of long Covid have significantly decreased, given recent research suggesting the risk of developing long Covid from the Omicron variant is lower.
However, the sheer scale of cases over the past year has resulted in more than a third of people with long Covid acquiring it during the Omicron wave, according to the ONS. 
mptoms reported by newer long Covid sufferers are still broadly similar: weakness or tiredness, difficulty concentrating, shortness of breath and muscle aches are mentioned most often.
What might be surprising is that for many of these people the severity of their long Covid has not diminished.
After going through a mild Covid infection myself in January, two weeks after returning to work I rapidly went downhill and ended up taking a month off work being closely monitored by doctors and hospital specialists.
Over the following months I spent most days in bed due to fatigue and severe joint pain, and struggled to walk more than a short distance without chest pain. 
I experienced significant cognitive issues with memory, speech and hearing, developed pleurisy, and even a reactivated Epstein-Barr virus responsible for my long-forgotten bout of glandular fever more than a decade ago.
I was officially diagnosed with long Covid after 12 weeks and had gone from balancing a demanding job going into the office throughout the pandemic alongside exercise, hobbies and nights out to requiring help with basic tasks and rarely leaving my bedroom. 
It's now been 10 months, and I still experience chronic pain, brain fog, and muscle twitching and I struggle to do simple housework or activities even after taking a prescribed cocktail of painkillers and supplements.
Patients like me are usually referred to post-Covid assessment clinics after experiencing symptoms for 12 weeks - however, waiting times have not improved much within the past year.
NHS England figures show 33% of Londoners given an initial assessment had to wait 15 weeks or more from the time of their referral, compared to 39% from a similar period in 2021.
Long Covid treatment across NHS services in England still varies hugely too, according to the Royal College of Nursing, with some services treating it as a physical condition but others as psychological.
After waiting more than 19 weeks I was finally assessed in August but was left feeling hopeless, with a one-hour Zoom call offering diet and pain management advice - but no further investigations, referrals or treatment.
British Medical Association (BMA) has called on the government to increase funding for long Covid clinics to deal with ever-increasing patient numbers. The BMA says that NHS England's 2022 strategy set out in July failed to announce any new funding.
Despite this, research efforts are gathering pace and one long Covid clinic in central London is taking part in a study to gain a better understanding of how health systems respond to people living with the illness, and its effects.
University College Hospital in Fitzrovia is one of six sites taking part in the Stimulate ICP research project.
Staff there have seen 4,200 patients since May 2020 and on average 120 people a week are treated, 40 of whom are new referrals.
Dr Melissa Heightman, who runs the clinic, explained that patients begin with a consultation to understand their symptoms, and are then offered targeted treatment and rehabilitation.
re is no one theory as to what causes long Covid, Dr Heightman said, but thanks to the ongoing research her team are now ""increasingly recognising the patterns of illness and they're not a surprise to doctors"".
""We're learning a lot about this condition and are really finding improved ways to speed up people's recovery,"" she said, adding: ""One of the things we're looking at is whether medicines used in similar scenarios could be used for long Covid illness.""
Sophia Pemberton, a 31-year-old special needs teacher, had her first appointment at the clinic after living with symptoms since she caught Covid in March 2020.
where she worked remained open throughout the lockdowns, and Sophia explained that even as more people caught Covid she ""naively thought it'd be just like a cold"", until she became ill herself.
""Things just didn't really get any better. It took months and months to build up the stamina to get to the end of my street,"" she said.
Sophia experiences breathlessness, pain, fatigue, brain fog, muscle twitching, sleep problems and more, and has tried a variety of pain medications.
She has had to go part time at work and ""can't do anything"" once she gets home at the end of the day.
""I use a walking aid now because my balance has been badly affected,"" she said.
""It's absolute exhaustion to the point of not being able to move some days; not being able to lift up a fork to feed myself.""
r said she had no health issues before and used to play lots of sports, but now even struggles to do everyday tasks.
""Things that I took for granted, even cooking and cleaning, I rely heavily on my husband for now. I didn't ever think at my age that would be necessary,"" she said.
upport group I belong to has more than 56,000 members and one topic that leads discussions is wider acceptance of long Covid.
Many people report falling out with friends, family and even their marriages breaking down due to a lack of support or understanding about their illness.
Some, including me, have also been targeted by strangers on public transport because they are taking measures to protect themselves from re-infection by wearing a mask.
Sophia says that a lack of compassion for the condition has also made her life even more difficult: ""People don't get it. I'm constantly having to explain and it's really hard to get through to people.
""To a large degree people want Covid to be over, and to hear about people suffering doesn't really compute with the idea that it's 'all gone' and in the past.""
For the two million people in the UK estimated to be dealing with the life-changing effects of the condition, they too wish that it was over - but are relying on new research, improved treatment, and kindness from others until that time comes.

entertainment	American Music Awards: Kelly Rowland asks crowd to 'chill' as they boo Chris Brown	"Kelly Rowland asked the audience at the American Music Awards to ""chill out"" after they booed Chris Brown's victory in the best male R&B artist category.
Brown has been a divisive figure ever since he pleaded guilty to assaulting then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009.
He did not attend Sunday's AMAs after a planned tribute to Michael Jackson was cancelled at the last minute.
Rowland, accepting the award on his behalf, seemed surprised by the audience's reaction.
""Excuse me... chill out,"" she said as cameras panned to show the audience, some of whom were booing and making other unclear remarks.
Rowland then continued: ""But I wanted to tell Chris, thank you so much for making great R&B music and I want to tell him thank you for being an incredible performer. 
""I'll take this award [and] bring it to you. I love you. Congratulations. And congratulations to all the nominees in this category.""
Brown had been due to honour the 40th anniversary of Michael Jackson's blockbuster Thriller album at Sunday's ceremony in LA, performing hits including Beat It, Billie Jean, Wanna Be Starting Something and Thriller.
No reason for the cancellation was given. Brown himself was taken aback, posting a video of his rehearsal with the caption: ""U serious?""
""Would've been the [biggest] AMA performance but they cancelled me for reasons unknown,"" he added in the comments. 
Artists who did perform at the show included Imagine Dragons, Carrie Underwood and Pink - who gave a poignant rendition of Grease's Hopelessly Devoted To You in tribute to Olivia Newton-John, who died in August.
Lionel Richie was given the Icon Award, honouring his legacy of hits with the Commodores and as a solo artist.
He was given the prize by fellow Motown artist Smokey Robinson, who joked that he first knew the singer as ""the guy with the biggest afro in the Commodores"".
king the stage, Richie thanked his family and made a point of speaking directly to the ""young superstars"" in the room.
""God has given you a light. That light is special, that light is only given to a few,"" he said. 
""When you hear the word 'hip,' it means today. When you hear the word 'inspiring,' it means forever. If you get a chance to have that light on you, understand what God has in store.""
Stevie Wonder and Charlie Puth then celebrated his discography in a head-to-head piano duel, performing Three Times a Lady, Easy, All Night Long (All Night), Say You, Say Me, Brick House and Jesus Is Love.

r Swift was the night's biggest winner, taking home all six of her nominations, including the night's top prize - artist of the year.
""I have the fans to thank essentially for my happiness,"" said the singer. ""I cannot express how unbelievable it is to me that I still do this and that you still care.""
She also won album of the year for Red (Taylor's Version) - a new version of her 2012 album that re-recorded to reclaim ownership of her music, after her former record label sold her master tapes to a hedge fund.
""I cannot tell you how much my re-recorded albums mean to me, but I never expected or assumed that they would mean anything to you,"" she said. ""So I can't thank you enough for caring about this album that I'm so proud of.""
Swift now has a lifetime total of 40 AMAs, extending her lead at the most successful artist in the history of the fan-voted awards ceremony.
Dove Cameron, a former Disney Channel and Marvel actress who scored a global hit this year with sultry single Boyfriend, was named best new artist.

politics	Did Boris Johnson mislead Parliament over parties?	"Some Conservative MPs have suggested that Boris Johnson should stand in the contest to be party leader and prime minister following the resignation of Liz Truss.
He is currently being investigated by a Commons committee over whether he misled MPs when talking about parties in Downing Street. The Privileges Committee plans to start taking evidence in public sessions before the end of November.
Mr Johnson, who has already been fined by police for breaking his own Covid rules, could face suspension from the House of Commons or even lose his seat, if the committee finds he was in contempt of Parliament. 
He announced his resignation as prime minister on 7 July, but stayed in post until Liz Truss took over on 6 September. 
re has been discussion about whether the committee needs to be convinced that he deliberately misled MPs to rule that he was in contempt.
In July, the Privileges Committee said its legal advice was that the prime minister's intent was not relevant to this judgement, although it could affect any penalties imposed.
Senior lawyer Lord Pannick was asked to look into this by Mr Johnson. He described the committee's approach as ""fundamentally flawed"". It rejected his criticism. 
re the key times Boris Johnson talked in Parliament about Downing Street parties, when he was prime minister. 
Date of quote: 8 December 2021
Context: Labour MP Catherine West asked: ""Will the prime minister tell the House whether there was a party in Downing Street on 13 November [2020]?""
What Mr Johnson said: ""No - but I am sure that whatever happened, the guidance was followed and the rules were followed at all times.""
Let's break down his answer. 
Party 
first part is the apparent denial that there was a party on 13 November 2020. 
Ms West's question specified ""party"" and that is not a term for which there is a precise definition. 
Sue Gray, the civil servant who investigated Downing Street parties and gatherings, does not use the word when detailing the events of 13 November. Instead, her report mentions: 
f the former show the then prime minister raising a glass in front of several people and a table with a number of wine bottles, as well as takeaway food.
Rules
Mr Johnson said the rules were followed ""at all times"". 
But we now know they were not. The Metropolitan Police investigation into gatherings at Downing Street led to a total of 126 fines being issued to 83 individuals for breaking Covid rules.
On the specific date he was being asked about, we know the Met issued fines - for breaches of the rules on indoor gatherings of two or more people. 
Met has not specified which event, but the BBC has been told that at least one person who attended the leaving drinks that Mr Johnson was pictured at was fined. The then prime minister did not receive a fine - the Met has not explained why.
Guidance
Mr Johnson said the guidance was followed ""at all times"".
guidance for working in offices at the time said ""only absolutely necessary participants should physically attend meetings"" and they should maintain social distancing. 
He told Parliament on 23 June that: ""Where it is possible to keep 2m apart, people should. But where it is not, we will advise people to keep a social distance of 1m-plus."" That guidance was still current by 13 November. 
re was nothing in that guidance document that implied that leaving drinks or other forms of socialising at work were allowed.
But the photos in the Sue Gray report clearly show Mr Johnson drinking in front of staff members - who are standing very close to each other - with bottles of wine on a table. 
r gathering on 13 November was in Mr Johnson's flat. 
report says there was a meeting that evening ""to discuss the handling"" of the departures of Mr Cain and special adviser Dominic Cummings. 
Five special advisers were present, along with food and alcohol. Mr Johnson joined at 20:00 and the ""discussion carried on later into the evening"". 
Previously, several newspapers reported that Abba songs could be heard playing in the No 10 flat that evening. 
Date of quote: 25 May 2022
Context: The prime minister's response in Parliament to the final publication of the Sue Gray report.
What Johnson said: ""I am happy to set on the record now that when I said - I came to this house and said in all sincerity that the rules and guidance had been followed at all times - it was what I believed to be true. It was certainly the case when I was present at gatherings to wish staff farewell.""
We know from the Sue Gray report that he attended leaving drinks on: 
Mr Johnson says both rules and guidance were ""certainly"" followed when he was present at these gatherings. 
We know that two of them (13 November and 14 January) led to police fines but we can't tell whether these rule breaches happened when he was there.
When it comes to the guidance, the photos of the Lee Cain event apparently show people closer than 1m together, and thus not following the guidance, while Mr Johnson was in the room and looking on. 
Date of quote: 8 December 2021
Context: Opening remarks to Parliament after a video emerged of members of his staff joking about whether there had been a Christmas party at Downing Street. 
What Johnson said: ""I have been repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged that there was no party and that no Covid rules were broken.""
rty they were talking about is understood to be the one on 18 December 2020, when between 20 and 45 individuals gathered for a ""Wine & Cheese Evening"" and ""Secret Santa"".  
re is no mention, in the Sue Gray report, of Boris Johnson being present or having been notified about it.
Mr Johnson's claim, on 8 December 2021, revolves around what assurances he was given, which we do not know. 
If he was told there was no party - he could argue he had not knowingly misled the House.

health	My mum's 40-hour wait to get to A&E with hip break	"When 85-year-old Koulla fell at home, her family immediately rang for an ambulance. She was in agonising pain - she had broken her hip.
It was around 8pm. It took another 14 hours for an ambulance to get to her, leaving her pregnant granddaughter to care for her through the night.
When they arrived the crews were able to give her pain relief and quickly transported her to the Royal Cornwall Hospital.
But there the wait continued - there were around 30 ambulances queuing to handover patients to A&E staff.
It was another 26 hours before she was taken inside to A&E.
She then faced many hours in A&E before being taken for surgery. 
Koulla's daughter, Marianna Flint, 53, said: ""It was awful. You feel helpless because you're giving your trust over to them to look after a family member who's in agony and who needs surgery.""
She has since received a written apology from the Royal Cornwall for the care provided to her mother in August.
rust said it was ""sincerely"" sorry for the failings.
Ms Flint said: ""I almost feel sorry for those looking after her. It's not down to them. There was no room inside to accept her in.""
But Koulla is just one of many thousands of patients getting caught up in these delays.
When ambulance crews bring patients to hospital they are meant to be able to handover their patients to A&E staff within 15 minutes.
But an analysis by the BBC shows by late November more than 11,000 ambulances were spending over an hour stuck in queues outside hospital every week.
f all arrivals and the highest since records began in 2010.
Rishi Sunak said he will sit down with the NHS ""relatively soon"" to discuss the issues around ambulance waiting times. 
Speaking on Thursday evening, the prime minister said he wanted to see waiting times come down and the government had put more money into the NHS to help address the issue. 
He said more money had also been put into social care to allow people to move out of hospitals and back into their homes.  
He added: ""I want to make sure the extra funding we're putting in is actually going to make a difference on the ground.""
College of Paramedics said crews were facing a ""perfect storm"", with the queues outside A&E preventing them reaching patients who need a 999 response.
College chief executive Tracy Nicholls said: ""We all know patients are coming to harm and in some cases severe harm.""
And even when patients are admitted into A&E they can face long waits for a bed on a ward, with hospital bosses blaming a shortage of beds and problems discharging patients back into the community.
Experts believe these problems are a contributing factor to the high levels of deaths being recorded - in recent months 1,000 more deaths a week are being seen than would be expected. 
Royal College of Emergency Medicine believes disruption to emergency care may account for around a quarter of these deaths.
College president Dr Adrian Boyle said ambulances had effectively become ""wards on wheels"".
Both ambulance response times and A&E waits have hit their worst levels on record in all parts of the UK in recent months.
In Cornwall, patients facing emergencies such as heart attacks and strokes are now waiting more than two hours on average for an ambulance. The target is 18 minutes.
re thought to be among the worst delays in the country, but none of England's ambulance services is close to the target, while Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are all missing their targets.
Alongside Cornwall, parts of Gloucestershire, Lincolnshire, Somerset and Bristol have the longest waits, Freedom of Information requests by the Liberal Democrats have revealed.
roblems come as NHS staff prepare to take strike action.
Unions have cited the problems facing the emergency care system as one of the factors motivating members to vote for a walkout.
A strike by members of the Royal College of Nursing is planned for 15 and 20 December in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, while earlier this week the two main unions representing ambulance staff said their members had also backed walkouts.
government said the NHS will publish its emergency care recovery plan in the new year, which will set out proposals to improve ambulance response times and A&E performance in England.
A spokesman for the Department of Health said an extra £500m was being made available to speed up hospital discharges and free up space in A&E, creating the equivalent of at least 7,000 more beds this winter
""This will be supported by an additional £6.6bn in the NHS over the next two years to enable rapid action to improve urgent and emergency care performance towards pre-pandemic levels,"" he added.

business	Firms hold off investment due to Tory turmoil	"re is good news and bad news for the government this morning. 
good news is that the financial markets have not taken further fright at the extraordinary political scenes of discord and chaos in the UK's governing party. 
As Tony Danker of the CBI business lobby group said to me last week, ""market stability is a pre-requisite for business investment - nothing happens if the government's borrowing costs (which affect all borrowing costs) are soaring"". 
Government bond yields (the interest rate the government has to pay to borrow) were stable this morning and are half a percent below the level seen in the aftermath of the disastrous mini-budget.
re is a striking consensus among business leaders and owners in their appreciation of the calming influence of the new Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt.
""He's started well,"" said one. ""I don't care who is PM as long as they don't mess with Hunt,"" said another. ""Either we have a new prime minister with Hunt as chancellor or another chancellor with Hunt as PM,"" said another.
reciate that the reverse-budget he delivered has reduced what is openly called ""the moron premium"" that the UK government, and therefore everyone else, has to pay to borrow.
's the good news. The bad news is that stability is necessary for investment, but it is not sufficient. 
""The UK is uninvestable right now,"" according to the head of the UK subsidiary of an international company.
Another boss told me: ""We need to see what incentives to invest there will be in the government's new plan and where the OBR ends up,"" a reference to the independent analysis of the Office for Budget Responsibility watchdog that usually accompanies big economic policy decisions and which was so glaringly absent from the recent mini-budget. 
r bad news is that there is little confidence that the Conservative Party will be able to agree on what the climate for investment will look like.
Key issues such as planning reform and immigration policy are big factors when businesses are choosing to invest and the Conservatives seem riven with the kind of conflict that produced the chaotic scenes over a vote to ban fracking cunningly tabled by the Labour Party. 
Immigration is a particularly sensitive one for business and the Tory party in a post-Brexit world.
As one (Brexit-voting as it happens) UK chief executive said to me: ""I can see why you would want to control immigration, but that doesn't mean having a pathological hatred of it with totally arbitrary targets.
""I can see why you might want the freedom to change some regulation or diverge in some areas but not an obsession to deregulate or diverge for its own sake - that makes life harder for business not easier.""
Many business leaders fear that there is no one unity candidate who can get everyone in the same tent. The frackers and the anti-frackers, the planning looseners and the nimbys, the fans of a hard line on the numbers of foreign workers and those who recognise it is very hard to grow an economy unless you have the workers to do the additional work.

politics	Ukraine counter-offensive: Russian forces retreat as Ukraine takes key towns	"Watch: Ukrainian military enter key city of Kupiansk
Russian forces have withdrawn from key eastern towns, as a rapid Ukrainian counter-attack makes further gains. 
Ukrainian officials said troops entered Kupiansk, a vital eastern supply hub for Russian forces, on Saturday.
Russia's defence ministry then said its troops have retreated from nearby Izyum to allow them ""to regroup"".
ministry also confirmed the withdrawal of troops from a third key town, Balaklyia, in order to ""bolster efforts"" on the Donetsk front.
Ukrainian advances - if held - would be the most significant since Russia withdrew from areas around Kyiv in April.
In his nightly video address on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed that Ukraine had now liberated 2,000 sq km (700 sq miles) from Russia since beginning a renewed counter-offensive earlier this month.
His claim would suggest that half of that area has been recaptured in the last 48 hours alone - as it is twice the area of territory Mr Zelensky said had been liberated when he spoke on Thursday evening.
Russia's admission of a withdrawal from Izyum is significant because it was a major military hub for Moscow.
""A three-day operation was carried out on the drawdown and organised transfer of the Izyum-Balakliya group of troops to the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic,"" the Russian statement said.
""In order to prevent damage to the Russian troops, a powerful fire defeat was inflicted on the enemy.""
Shortly afterwards, the chief administrator of Russian-controlled parts of the Kharkiv region recommended that its residents evacuate to Russia ""to save lives"", according to the Russian state-run Tass news agency.
And the governor of the neighbouring Belgorod region, in Russia, said mobile catering, heating, and medical assistance would be available to people queuing to cross the border.
will be seen as a sign that Ukraine's army has the capacity to retake Russian-occupied territory, crucial as Kyiv continues to ask its hard-pressed Western allies for military support. 
Ukraine's Foreign Minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the latest developments had shown its forces were able to defeat the Russian army and could end the war faster with more Western weapons.
Encouragement for Kyiv and allies
Analysis by Orla Guerin, Senior International Correspondent in central Ukraine
f the counter-offensive has not only caught the Russians off guard, but even surprised some Ukrainians. People here have been struggling to keep up with news of the latest gains.
Russians have now lost two key logistics hubs - the railway cities of Izyum and Kupiansk. This is a military setback and a public humiliation for President Putin.
We cannot reach the frontlines. Journalists have been denied access. Ukraine is determined to control the information war. But plenty of footage has emerged on social media showing Ukrainian troops raising their flag in newly liberated areas.
All of this is cathartic for Ukraine and reassuring for its Western backers.
Russians still hold around a fifth of the country and few imagine a swift end to the war. But the Ukrainians have now shown they can beat the Russians in battle, not just outmanoeuvre them. According to one military expert, it's the first time since World War Two that whole Russian units have been lost.
Earlier, UK defence officials said Ukraine had advanced 50km (31 miles) into previously Russian-held territory.
""Russian forces were likely taken by surprise,"" the UK Ministry of Defence said. ""The sector was only lightly held and Ukrainian units have captured or surrounded several towns.""
Ukraine launched its counter-offensive in the east earlier this week, while international attention was focused on an anticipated advance near the southern city of Kherson. 
Analysts believe Russia redirected some of its most seasoned troops to defend the city. 
But as well as gaining ground in the east, Ukraine is also making gains in the south, an official said. 
Nataliya Gumenyuk, a spokesperson for the Ukrainian army's southern command, said they had advanced ""between two and several dozens of kilometres"" along that front. 
But Russian forces fighting on the southern front are said to have dug into defensive positions, and Ukraine's troops have faced heavy resistance since the offensive began.
And in Kharkiv itself, one person was killed and several homes damaged on Saturday as Russian rocket fire hit the city, according to local officials. 
Ukrainian officials shared a picture on social media that appeared to show Ukrainian troops holding up the country's flag in front of Kupiansk city hall, with the Russian flag at their feet.
On Friday President Zelensky said his forces were ""gradually taking control of new settlements"" and ""returning the Ukrainian flag and protection for all our people"". 
He also said that national police units were returning to liberated settlements and urged civilians to report suspected Russian war crimes to them. 
His call followed a report from the UN's monitoring team in Ukraine which said they had ""documented a range of violations against prisoners of war"" by Moscow's forces. 
report also accused Ukrainian troops of ""cases of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war"". "	/news/world-europe-62860774
entertainment	Abused women's stories inspire Leicester art exhibition	"Artwork inspired by women who have suffered violence and abuse is to go on display in Leicester.
Artist Lis Naylor produced eight pieces after spending a day hearing about the experiences of women in the city.
She worked with the Zinthaya Trust, a charity which supports people affected by poverty and abuse, to put together the exhibition called Untold Stories.
It opens at the BetaX exhibition space in Church Gate on Monday.
rust invited a number of people to meet the artist who said she wanted to tell the stories of underrepresented women.
Ms Naylor said: ""This project makes people aware of the issues that some of these marginalised groups of women face. 
""I want to get the message across that however much pain these women have experienced, they are worthy, valued, empowered, and have a bright future.
""It was an honour and a privilege to have these women share their stories with us and I have the utmost respect for them.
""They talked about their gardens, their homes and the animals they loved.""
She said she had developed works that featured an outline of the women with the face of their ""spirit animal"", holding a placard with a message to their perpetrator.
A spokeswoman for the Zinthaya Trust said: ""The women were 100% engaged in the workshop.
""They took part, they wanted to collaborate and it made them think about what they like and enjoy. Through this project they came out of their shells and opened up to new people.""
kets for the exhibition are free and it runs until 30 November.

politics	Scotland and the rules of Euro engagement	"Brexit has done nothing to improve the quality of the word soup concocted at the European Commission in Brussels:
""The Commission's orientations seek to create a more transparent, simpler and integrated architecture for macro-fiscal surveillance to better deliver on the objectives of ensuring debt sustainability and promoting sustainable growth.""
's merely the simplified bit, after nearly three years of consultation on the Commission's proposal that reform is needed to the fiscal rules for government borrowing under which EU members have to operate.
If Britain were still a member, the demands placed on governments to comply with Brussels requirements would have become a major issue.
But it's not. So why should we care? Well, the debate about Scottish independence has a lot to do with a) how fast a newly independent Scotland could join the trading bloc as a new member and b) what it would have to do to comply with the economic rules.
moved on since 2014 and the referendum. London's objections would no longer be a problem for an independent Scotland joining the EU, and the government in Madrid might be less likely to perceive worrying parallels with Catalonia.
In recent days, this debate has focused on whether Holyrood would have to commit to joining the euro. And if not a full commitment for a rapid embrace of the single currency, then how long could that be put off? Indefinitely?
No-one knows for sure. No country has been in the position of an independent Scotland, applying to re-join a union of which its people were previously citizens.
But in its verbose statement on Wednesday, the European Commission has given the independence debate in Scotland some more to chew on.
It relates to the fiscal rules for membership: a government deficit of no more than 3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP, the measured total output from across the economy), and a government debt of no more than 60% of GDP.
Where stands Scotland now? Last fiscal year, Scottish government figures show the deficit at 12.3%, and the UK at 6.1%. But that was the second year of Covid. A more helpful guide would be the pre-Covid figures. 
Scottish deficit (estimates of all government spending set against all tax from Scots) ran between 8% and 9% of GDP in the three years up to April 2020. The UK figure was under 3%, as a result of those austerity years.
And debt? Scotland doesn't carry debt in any conventional sense. And at the SNP conference last month, Nicola Sturgeon swiped aside the notion that an independent Holyrood could repudiate any responsibility for the UK's debt. 
At the end of September, the UK had public sector net debt of £2450bn, or 98% of GDP. Scotland's share would be negotiable, but it's likely to be based on population share or the proportion of the UK economy.
On both deficit and debt, an independent Scotland would be far outside the EU rules.
From that starting point, those who favour independence may welcome the reform news from Brussels. If the new fiscal rules are adopted, there will be more flexibility in getting debt and deficits down. 
's partly because EU members have had to borrow and splurge to get their health systems and economies through the pandemic, and now they're spending big on mitigating the impact of higher energy bills. So others are also breaking the rules.
Last month, official EU statistics showed average government deficits, on average, fell from 6.7% of GDP in the first year of Covid to 4.6% last year.
Debt varies widely. Fourteen EU members ended last year above the 60% of GDP threshold and only 13 within it. Government debt was 88% of output.
Seven countries had a higher deficit level than the UK, topped by Greece with 194% and Italy with 150%, while Estonia, Bulgaria and Luxembourg were around 20%.
Commission is conceding that these rules are not fit for purpose. It was doing so even before Covid struck, when it began this reform consultation.
It is now proposing that Brussels is less heavy-handed with the surveillance of nations' budgets, with onerous reporting requirements, and aims its efforts at those countries with deficits and debts that pose a risk.
with debt levels that break EU rules will be required, automatically, to enter the Excessive Deficit Procedure, agreeing to a four-year plan to get back below the limit. It will be flexible enough not to choke off investment in things the Commission likes, including a green, digital economy.
And it should be 'owned' by the member country, in shaping the fiscal plan and in policing it. This is in the hope that it is seen as something that's not imposed from Brussels, or by its big powers - notably Germany. 
Remember how it looked from Greece's point of view, as German Chancellor Angela Merkel was seen to be calling the shots and forcing its compliance with debt reduction during the euro crisis?
reforms address one of the more bizarre aspects of these rules - that the punishment for those governments which break the rules, and which do not have enough money to pay their bills, is to fine them, heavily. 
Enforcement has been patchy at best, and the Commission makes the bold claim that reformed rules will work better if it is backed by lower fines. It adds there could also be an unspecified reputational hit.
's where these proposed reforms are not so good for the Scottish independence cause.
While saying there should be more flexibility, they firm up the rules, saying that there will still be a 3% of GDP maximum deficit and 60% maximum debt. 
's in a treaty and there is no flexibility there. Reformed rules mean there will be less opportunity for members to get round them.
If Scotland takes a population share of the UK's public sector net debt, that looks close to £200bn. And if that is around 98% of GDP, assuming Scottish and UK GDP per head are at similar levels, a cut to the 60% limit implies a debt reduction would be required of nearly £80bn. 
require a straight-forward paying back of debt, as if paying off a loan. To placate the bond markets, the UK Treasury is currently trying to find a way of getting debt down as a proportion of GDP, and not by paying debt back early, but by using both growth and inflation to ease the pain of spending cuts and tax increases. 
You'll see how it's getting on when the Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, delivers his autumn statement next week. It probably won't look pretty.
Under the EU rules, an independent Scotland would have to do something similar, negotiating it with the European Commission, and then being watched closely to ensure it's sticking to the 'agreed' plan.
Its government deficit - on a pre-Covid trend nearly three times higher than the permitted EU limit - would face similar measures.
After the Brexit referendum and a period of uncertainty, the SNP came down clearly in favour of a newly independent Scotland getting into the European Union.
Not all supporters of independence agree. And the flexing and strengthening of the fiscal and borrowing rules in Brussels raises the question: how independent would an independent Scotland really be inside the European Union? "	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-63578343
politics	Higher earners in Scotland to pay more income tax	"John Swinney explains why he is asking higher earners to pay more in tax
Everyone earning more than £43,662 in Scotland will have to pay more income tax next year.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the higher rate of tax will increase from 41p to 42p in the pound in April, and the top rate from 46p to 47p.
x threshold for the top rate will also be lowered from £150,000 to £125,140.
ge has already been announced for other parts of the UK by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt.
Mr Swinney described the increase as an ""extra penny to enable spending on patient care in our National Health Service"".
And he said he was asking people to ""pay their fair share"" so they could ""help to create the fairer society in which we all want to live"". 
But the Scottish Conservatives said making higher and middle earners in Scotland pay more more tax than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK risked undermining the country's potential for economic growth.
Scottish Labour said the extra money would be used to ""fix some of the damage done by 15 years of SNP cuts and failure"" and predicted that people will not accept rising tax bills ""if all they see is further decline in services"".
Mr Swinney had been due to deliver his budget statement at 14:30 - but Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone suspended the session for 30 minutes so she could investigate how details of the tax rises had been revealed by the BBC two hours earlier. 
Ms Johnstone later allowed Mr Swinney to speak after receiving ""categoric assurance"" from him and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon that the information had not been shared by the government. 
Income tax rates in Scotland, as well as several other taxes, are set by the Scottish government rather than at Westminster.
About 500,000 people in Scotland are in the higher rate bracket while a further 33,000 pay the top rate of income tax, according to the government. 
reshold for the 41p higher rate will remain frozen at £43,663 in Scotland - lower than the £50,271 elsewhere in the UK.
And there will be no changes to the rate paid by lower earners, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon previously saying this would be counterproductive in a cost of living crisis. 
residing officer suspended parliament to investigate how details of the tax rises were given to the BBC in advance of the budget statement
ges mean that everyone earning more than that threshold will pay more income tax than they did last year, and more than people earning the same salary elsewhere in the UK.
reases are a significant departure from the SNP's manifesto aim not to alter income tax rates for the duration of this parliament.
Mr Swinney said that the changes will raise a total of £553m next year when taken alongside changes to other taxes including Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) - the Scottish equivalent of stamp duty. 
mes tax part of LBTT will rise from 4% to 6%.
uty first minister also confirmed an extra £550m for local government next year. Local authorities had been asking for much more, but will be given full flexibility to set their own council tax rates.
Mr Swinney said councils should ""consider carefully the cost pressures facing the public"" when deciding the rate they will charge people.
Scottish Child Payment will remain at the increased level of £25 per child per week, with all other social security benefits under the control of the Scottish government being increased by the rate of inflation in September of 10.1%. 
r had already confirmed that benefits and pensions paid by the UK government would also rise by that figure.
Spending on health and social care in Scotland will increase by £1bn, Mr Swinney said.
And funding of £20m that had been set aside for a referendum on Scottish independence will instead be used to help people at risk of fuel poverty.
Supreme Court recently ruled that the Scottish government does not have the power to hold a vote without the formal consent of Westminster.
Meanwhile, the basic rate of business rates, which is also called the poundage, will be frozen at 49.8p. The intermediate property rate, at 51.1p, will be charged on properties with a rateable value of between £51,001 and £100,000. The threshold for the higher property rate will increase from £95,000 to £100,000.
kely to be one of the most memorable budgets in Holyrood's short history. 
Not because the statement was delayed after the BBC established some of the key details in advance. 
Instead, because of the significant tax changes it contains - with higher and top rates of income tax now two pence above the comparable rates elsewhere in the UK. 
g political choice by the Scottish government which abandons their manifesto intentions not to tinker with tax rates at all before the next election. 
Conservatives think they're making a mistake that could damage economic recovery while trades unions have welcomed the tax rises albeit they would have liked them to be higher. 
Ministers expected this criticism and suspect the political and financial pain would have been much greater if their decisions had gone the other way. 
Mr Swinney said the budget was being announced against the backdrop of the ""most turbulent economic and financial context most people can remember"".
He added: ""War is taking place in Europe, leading to the suffering and displacement of millions of Ukrainians. As a result of the conflict, energy and fuel prices are surging. Inflation is now corroding our economy having reached a 40-year high.
""If these challenges - faced by countries around the globe - were not enough, the UK has added to the turmoil by a disastrous approach to Brexit which has damaged labour supply through the loss of free movement of people and undermined frictionless trade with our nearest markets.
""All of these difficulties have been compounded by the utterly catastrophic decisions of the UK government in the September mini-budget, which have driven increases in interest rates and saddled the country with much higher debt, undermining the public finances for generations to come.""
Scottish Conservative finance spokesman Liz Smith said Mr Swinney should ""stop blaming the UK government for every single predicament"". 
And she said she was concerned about the tax differential between Scotland and the rest of the UK, which she fears could make Scotland a less attractive place to work, live and invest.
Scottish Labour finance spokesman Daniel Johnson said: ""The fact is that this money is going to have to be used to fix some of the damage done by 15 years of SNP cuts and failure.
""It is down to John Swinney to show how this money will be used to support our public services, and not to swell the ranks of spin doctors, quangos and apparatchiks."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63988944
entertainment	Rihanna releases Lift Me Up from Black Panther: Wakanda Forever	"Rihanna has released her first solo single in six years, a song taken from the soundtrack of the forthcoming Black Panther sequel.
Lift Me Up was released on Friday after the singer teased her return to music on social media earlier this week.
g will appear in Marvel's Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, which is set to be released in November.
Director Ryan Coogler said Rihanna's involvement in the project was to honour the late actor Chadwick Boseman.
""Honestly, I think it was Chad,"" he said. ""A lot of improbable things needed to happen for it to come through and Rihanna was very clear that she did that for him.""
Boseman starred in the first Black Panther film and also appeared in Da 5 Bloods, 21 Bridges and the James Brown biopic Get On Up.
He died in 2020, four years after being diagnosed with colon cancer. Last year, Boseman was posthumously nominated for an Oscar for his performance in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom.
Coogler added: ""We knew [Rihanna] was at a point in her life as well where she was focusing on different things - focused on business, motherhood, which is a big theme in our film. We were holding out hope that maybe it could work out and boy did it for this song.""
Lift Me Up has been co-written by Rihanna, Coogler and Nigerian singer-songwriter Tems, who has previously worked with Drake, Justin Bieber, Future, Wizkid, Beyonce and Khalid.
g is produced and co-written by Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson, who scored the first Black Panther film as well as Creed, Venom and Tenet. 
It is downtempo but uplifting, and sees Rihanna's distinctive vocals projected over a smooth accompaniment of delicate keys and strings. The singer is accompanied by a subtle backing choir as the atmospheric song builds to its climax.
She sings: ""Lift me up, hold me down, keep me close, safe and sound / Hold me when you go to sleep, keep me in the warmth of your love when you depart, keep me safe and sound.""
Fans warmly welcomed the release of the single on social media, with many joking via a string of memes that the song was making them levitate, but others described it as a ""disappointing"" comeback and ""definitely a movie soundtrack song"".
Lift Me Up is the first solo single from Rihanna since the release of her album Anti in 2016.
Since then, she has collaborated with other artists such as PartyNextDoor and N.E.R.D., and appeared on the hugely successful Wild Thoughts alongside DJ Khaled and Bryson Tiller.
But the singer has largely stayed quiet on the music front in recent years, as she focused on expanding her fashion, lingerie, skincare and cosmetics brand Fenty, as well as recently having a baby boy with rapper A$AP Rocky.
She also appeared opposite Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett in 2018's Ocean's 8, an all-female reboot of the Ocean's 11 franchise. 
Rihanna will headline the prestigious half-time show at February's Super Bowl in Arizona, her first live performance in over five years.
Her involvement in Wakanda Forever will increase fans' anticipation for the sequel to Black Panther, which was a huge box office success and scored a best picture nomination at the Oscars.

business	US stocks see worst first half drop in more than 50 years	"US stocks have seen their worst first half of a year since 1970, as concerns grow over how steps to curb inflation will affect economic growth.
In the last six months, the benchmark S&P 500 index fell 20.6%, while other major US indexes also dropped sharply.
Stocks in the UK, mainland Europe and Asia have also suffered steep losses.
It comes as central banks around the world are trying to rein in soaring living costs, with prices of essential goods like food and fuel jumping.
Some economists expect the US, which is the world's biggest economy, to go into a recession as early as this year as interest rates continue to rise.
""If the US Federal Reserve continues hiking rates the stock market will react quite negatively,"" Dan Wang, chief economist at Hang Seng Bank China, told the BBC.
Shane Oliver at AMP Capital said: ""Shares are likely to see continued short-term volatility as central banks continue to tighten to combat high inflation, the war in Ukraine continues and fears of recession remain high.""
Another major US stock index, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, fell by more than 15% in the first half of this year, the biggest drop for the period since 1962.
At the same time the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite lost almost 30%, marking its largest percentage drop for the first half of a year.
Major stock market indexes outside the US have also fallen sharply this year.
UK's FTSE 250 has dropped by more than 20%, while Europe's Stoxx 600 index has slipped by almost 17% and the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific markets has fallen by more than 18%.
It comes as many of the world's biggest central banks take steps to slow the rising cost of living, including raising interest rates.
Earlier this week, the bosses of three of the world's biggest central banks warned that the era of moderate inflation and low interest rates had ended.
At an annual meeting in Portugal, the heads of the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England said action must be taken quickly to prevent price rises from getting out of control.
However, they also cautioned that measures to rein in an inflation shock caused by the Ukraine war and pandemic may have a significant negative impact on global growth.
""Is there a risk that we would go too far? Certainly there's a risk, but I wouldn't agree that it's the biggest risk to the economy,"" Fed chairman Jerome Powell said.
""The bigger mistake to make, let's put it that way, would be to fail to restore price stability,"" he added.
Last month, the Fed announced its biggest rate rise in nearly 30 years as it ramped up its fight to rein in soaring consumer prices.
Bank of England also raised its key interest rate to the highest level in 13 years, from 1% to 1.25%.

Many of them mention Andrew Tate, the controversial influencer who has been banned from several platforms for his misogynist views.
wo-minute video, from an account with about 1,700 followers, has been viewed more than 1.2 million times.
Its creator Emmeline Hartley believes TikTok's algorithms are driving more hateful comments towards the film.
People using TikTok are served content based on a mixture of videos they have previously liked, and on which people like them have watched and commented.
kTok said misogyny was prohibited on the platform. 
""Our community guidelines specifically call it out as a hateful ideology and we are crystal clear that we do not want that content on our platform,"" said a spokesperson.
It added that it had removed more than 100 comments from Ms Hartley's video, which it said was a small proportion of the number that had been left. 
Ms Hartley said she had found it impossible to make direct contact with someone from the platform to get help.
""We don't have the capacity or the manpower to respond to all the comments,"" Ms Hartley said.
Her intention was to present a complicated but common scenario about sexual consent but she said she was concerned to see the film being used by some of those commenting as an example of women ""tricking"" men.
""I thought, 'what have I done? I've made a film that's helping rape culture'.""
She says she has seen other videos on TikTok that have been swamped with abusive comments where the creator is appealing for likes and positivity to help ""pull them back from the wrong side of TikTok"".
Ms Hartley's original video, Keep Breathing, was 18 minutes long and made in 2018, with funding from various local organisations in Derby and backed by the British Film Institute.
It is a fictional story featuring a couple arguing in a lift about a previous sexual encounter, interwoven with flashbacks to the evening it took place.
racters had both been drinking alcohol, they met in a nightclub, and there were misunderstandings about how they were going to get home and whether the man was going to stay with the woman. 
However, the clip she posted to TikTok in September featured only the pair's argument and not the contextual flashbacks. When Ms Hartley tried to add a separate video featuring those, they were repeatedly removed by TikTok on the grounds that they were explicit.
She has now been able to share the context, but says there are still many comments which are abusive towards women.
Although she considered removing the videos, Ms Hartley says she is content that she decided to share the post.
""I don't regret it, but I'm trying to navigate how to respond,"" she said.
""Some of the comments have been healthy, a couple of people have changed their minds while replying to each other. I think it's important, it needs to go out there.""
Social media consultant Matt Navarra said that TikTok's algorithm functions as a recommendation service, drawing both on the previous activity of the individual user and others like them, in order to serve up new content with which the person is also likely to engage. 
keeps them on the platform for longer and more frequently, which is good for advertisers and therefore also good for TikTok's advertising revenue.
""It means if this content has been seen, engaged with and liked by a group of users who are, for example, Andrew Tate fans, then it's likely to show that piece of content to even more people who are that sort of user,"" he said. ""It's self perpetuating.""
reator cannot stop this train once it is in motion, because they have no control over the algorithm itself and there are limited options for reporting issues, Mr Navarra added.
In July it was reported that Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, was going to make its algorithm more similar to TikTok's, rather than prioritising content from accounts that individuals were already following. "	/news/technology-63243423
politics	NI Protocol: Businesses question government's plans	"A consortium of business organisations has asked the UK government dozens of questions about how the replacement for the NI Protocol will work in practice.
rotocol is the post-Brexit trading deal agreed by the UK and the EU.
UK plans to override most of the agreement if the EU does not agree to changes.
questions from the NI Business Brexit Working Group suggest it is still unclear how UK unilateral measures would work on the ground.
It has called on the UK and EU to have businesses in Northern Ireland deeply involved in technical talks, warning that without that role there is a risk of ""misunderstandings and contradictions…resulting in further delay and controversy"".
rotocol keeps Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods, preventing checks on items at the Irish border and giving Northern Ireland manufacturers preferential access to the EU.
It also means there are checks and controls on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, leading to added cost and complexity for importing businesses.
UK government says the protocol is not working and needs to be changed, preferably by negotiation.
It is also proceeding with legislation, the Protocol Bill, which would see the UK make unilateral changes.
ges it is proposing include the concept of green lanes and red lanes.
rusted traders would use a green lane for GB goods that are destined only for Northern Ireland, meaning that would not need to be checked and would have minimal paperwork.
Goods destined to travel onwards to the Republic of Ireland would enter via a red lane, where they would be subject to standard EU controls and checks.
Alongside that is a plan for a dual regulatory regime, which would mean goods made to either EU or UK standard could be sold in Northern Ireland.
framework to empower the government to act, with the substance of these plans to be worked out later.
working group, whose members include the CBI, NI Chamber of Commerce and Ulster Farmers' Union have posed their questions in a consultation on the bill.
focus most of their queries on how the green lane and trusted trader concepts will work.
For example they want to know if the NI customer, the GB supplier, the haulier or all three would need to be a ""trusted trader"" for the purposes of the green lane.
ked if goods which have not been definitively categorised as staying in NI would by default have to use red lane procedures.
re is also a pointed question on the dual regulatory regime which asks the government to confirm ""whether there are any international precedents for introducing a full dual regulatory regime of similar size and scale with an open land border which it is using to inform its decision making?""
It's understood the government has engaged at length on the issues raised but no firm commitments have been given on how implementation will work.
working group also reiterates its view that the floor for any new agreement is the existing standstill arrangements and grace periods - not full implementation of the protocol."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63629061

business	Made.com furniture website on brink of collapse	"Online furniture retailer Made.com has stopped taking new orders after talks to find a buyer failed, pushing the firm towards collapsing. 
Bosses warned if further funding could not be raised before its cash reserves ran out, it would take ""appropriate steps to preserve value for creditors"".
firm's share price plummeted after it revealed rescue talks with potential buyers had been terminated on Tuesday.
mpany said its decision to halt orders was ""under review"".
It added ""a further announcement will be made as appropriate"". 
re price of the company, which employed around 700 staff at the end of last year, closed on Tuesday at just 0.5p a share, after dropping by more than 90%.
Made.com, which was launched in 2011 with £2.5m in funding, was co-founded by Ning Li and Brent Hoberman, best-known for starting Lastminute.com
Chloe Macintosh and Julien Callède also helped start the business.
Ning Li came up with the idea of sourcing directly from designers and manufacturers and selling their furniture on the Made.com website, targeting a computer-savvy audience.
During the course of the Covid pandemic, the firm's sales surged as people were confined to their homes, could only shop online, and bought more furniture and other home goods.
Sales hit £315m in 2020, a year-on-year rise of 30%, and in the first three months of 2021 they grew by 63% to £110m.
growth led to the firm listing on the London Stock Exchange in June last year with a value of £775m.
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, previously said when Made.com joined the stock market ""no-one would have thought the business would have been put up for sale 15 months later after a disastrous trading period"".
He said the firm became ""unstuck"" due to supply chain problems, with ""customers waiting months for their sofas to be delivered, leading to cancellations and frustration"".
""Then the cost-of-living crisis bit and big-ticket items like a new three-piece were put on the backburner, all contributing to a severe slump in Made.com's share price and a slew of profit warnings,"" he added.
Although Mr Hoberman is no longer actively involved in the running of the company, he is still a shareholder, as is Ning Li, who was chief executive until the end of 2016 and is currently a non-executive director. "	/news/business-63403363
health	Cost of living: I want to help others through the winter months	"xi driver Jamie Mclean says, like a lot of men, he was ""brought up in a culture of not sharing feelings"".
He struggled with mental health problems growing up and experienced a lack of support.
Jamie, 34, decided to set up a men's mental health group in his local community in West Dunbartonshire.
He said the added pressures of the cost of living crisis made him accelerate his plans to launch Mentor Scotland.
""We were originally going to start the group later, but we wanted to be prepared ahead of the tough winter months,"" he told BBC Scotland.
""Support can be difficult for people to get, and guys especially find it difficult to seek it out. 
""Peer-to-peer can be easier because they're speaking to similar people to themselves.""
Jamie, who lives in Alexandria, was faced with the reality of local mental health services while struggling with suicidal thoughts.
""I moved around a lot when I was a child, so I went to seven primary schools and three academies,"" he said.
""That was due to a traumatic experience that my mum had went through.
""I went on to party and drink a lot and I was probably a little bit reckless and not really dealing with anything. Everything just came to a head for me.""
Jamie said he went to the doctor and had counselling but that it ""just wasn't for me"".
""I wasn't able to deal with my thoughts and feelings,"" he added.
""After that I became quite suicidal. I felt like that for a long time but I had a young daughter and thankfully I didn't take my life and I can live today and talk about it.""
Jamie said peer-to-peer support and exercise helped him stop drinking and focus on his mental health.
""I started the group so that people have got that support, so they have got somebody to turn to,"" he said.
Despite only launching in November, Jamie said the men's support group has already helped people form friendships and take big steps.
""We've also started other initiatives as well, like football nights and going walks,"" he said.
meet once a week at the Ben View Resource Centre in Dumbarton on a Friday so people have an alternative to going out and drinking or taking drugs.
""I've heard from a lot of people who have been close to walking in but there's that bit of anxiety holding them back,"" he said.
""People struggle as we were brought up in a culture of men not sharing feelings. It can be a difficult and scary thing.""
Jamie said the Covid pandemic had also isolated a lot of people and now the increase in living costs is also having an impact on those dealing with mental health issues.
""The cost of living crisis is a major issue and talking point, it's well and truly noticeable and definitely affecting people, including myself,"" he said.
34-year-old said people from different walks of lives and all ages have turned up for support. 
""It's surprising how uplifted people seem when they leave,"" he added. ""It's like a weight has been lifted.""

health	Funding boost to crack Bristol hospital bed-blocking crisis	"Health leaders have been given millions of pounds to help ease ""harmful"" hospital bed-blocking. 
w local health authority board of Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire will share £11.5m of government funding.
Hospital wards are currently busy with patients who are well enough to leave.
will help get people into the most appropriate setting in the community, which should ease pressures on A&E and the ambulance service.
money comes from a £500m Department of Health and Social Care emergency pot to be used on getting medically fit patients out of hospital, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. 
It can be used to pay for more adult social care staff or can also be used to free up hospital beds in other ways - such as homecare and a programme called ""discharge to assess"" where patients continue to have their care and assessment out of hospital.
Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire Integrated Care Board (ICB) chief executive Shane Devlin told a meeting of the board that many of its longer-term priorities had been suspended until April.
""No matter which way we cut this, the most important thing for winter is can we get 'flow' and can we assure ourselves that people who don't need to be in hospital aren't in hospital,"" he said.
""We know that causes a massive amount of harm, not only to people in bed, both cognitively and physically, but also in flow with regard to ambulances,"" he added.
A report to the board said the ICB had been allocated £8.3million, Bristol City Council £1.7million, South Gloucestershire Council £780,000 and North Somerset Council £770,000 for its social care departments, with all money pooled.
""The focus is on making systems and processes work better to make the job of the individual in the ward or the care worker actually manageable,"" added Mr Devlin.

technology	Instagram U-turns on TikTok-style revamp	"Instagram says it is pausing a rollout of new features on its app following backlash online from users, influencers and celebrities.
Among the new features was an increase in recommended video content, in a similar style to rival app TikTok.
feeds were criticised as people felt they were not seeing photos from friends and family as much.
Meta, Instagram's parent company, said it wanted to ""take the time"" to get the changes right.
revamp of Instagram towards more video content is believed to have been ignited by the soaring popularity of competitor TikTok - where users post and watch more video as opposed to static photographs. 
According to data from digital analytics company Sensor Tower, the TikTok app has now been downloaded more than three billion times around the world - the first app not owned by Meta to reach this landmark.
Instagram boss Adam Mosseri told The Verge that the test version of the revamped app would be phased out within weeks. 
""I'm glad we took a risk - if we're not failing every once in a while, we're not thinking big enough or bold enough,"" he said.
""But we definitely need to take a big step back and regroup. [When] we've learned a lot, then we come back with some sort of new idea or iteration. So we're going to work through that.""
Mr Mosseri had previously posted a video explaining the move towards video, saying that full-screen videos would be promoted over photographs.
But after some backlash, he followed it up with a series of tweets saying he wanted to ""continue supporting photos"".
In response to Mr Mosseri's Twitter video, US model Chrissy Teigen said that users ""don't wanna make videos"" and are seeing lower engagement for photos.
Reality TV stars Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner also shared an online ""petition"" to ""Make Instagram Instagram again"" on their stories. 
, author and content creator, posted how frustrated she was with the changes and how Instagram was so much better when she received content from the people she chose to follow.
A Meta spokesperson told the BBC: ""Based on our findings and community feedback, we're pausing the full-screen test on Instagram so we can explore other options, and we're temporarily decreasing the number of recommendations you see in your feed so we can improve the quality of your experience. 
""We recognise that changes to the app can be an adjustment, and while we believe that Instagram needs to evolve as the world changes, we want to take the time to make sure we get this right.""

politics	Cabinet: David TC Davies promoted to Welsh secretary	"Monmouth MP David TC Davies has been promoted to Welsh secretary by the new Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak.
Mr Davies, junior minister in the Wales Office since 2019, replaces Sir Robert Buckland, who has left the cabinet.
Monmouth MP was first elected to parliament in 2005 and an assembly member from 1999 to 2007.
His appointment means the government avoids criticism for having an MP representing a seat in England as secretary of state for Wales. 
Sir Robert, MP for South Swindon, announced he had asked to leave the government earlier on Tuesday, but had not been expected to stay in the job.
He initially backed Mr Sunak in the summer's Tory leadership contest before switching to supporting to Liz Truss.
Mr Davies, a Welsh speaker, was also an assistant government whip from February 2020 to July this year and chaired the Welsh Affairs Select Committee for nine years.
He previously worked for British Steel, his family's shipping company, served in the Territorial Army and as a Special Constable with British Transport Police.
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said he ""will be invaluable in ensuring Wales is at the heart of the UK Government, especially drawing on his experience as an assembly member before becoming an MP"".
""I know he will continue to be a superb champion for our country now around the cabinet table.  
""David has been a good friend to many of us, including myself over many years.""
Sir Robert replaced Simon Hart as Welsh secretary in the summer, who has returned to government as the new chief whip.
Mr Hart, who takes over from Wendy Morton in the whips office, will be responsible for discipline in the party, ensuring the government wins votes in Commons, and for maintaining a good relationship with backbench MPs.
It is a particularly important post, after the chaotic scenes in parliament that culminated in the resignation of Ms Truss. 
Mr Hart, who represents Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire at Westminster, quit the cabinet in July as part of successful efforts by ministers to force the then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson from office. 
Sir Robert was kept on in the Wales Office when Ms Truss took over from Mr Johnson in September.
On Tuesday, Sir Robert said: ""It has been an honour to serve as secretary of state for Wales and to have served four prime ministers as solicitor general, justice minister and lord chancellor.  
""I am leaving the government at my request but will be supporting Rishi Sunak from the back benches.""
Welsh secretary, or secretary of state for Wales, to use its formal title, leads the Wales Office which, since devolution began in 1999, has no direct role in the running of Welsh public services.
rtment says it represents Wales' interests in the UK government and ensures devolution - the system which determines what powers lie in Cardiff - delivers for Wales."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63386479

health	Ambulance handover delays: Hospitals blame 'delayed discharges'	"One in five ambulance patients in England waited more than an hour to be handed to A&E teams during the week leading up to Christmas.
Among trusts which had more than 500 ambulance arrivals, the highest proportion of patients waiting over an hour was 54% at University Hospitals Bristol & Weston.
was followed by Gloucestershire Hospitals at 53%.
NHS England said hospitals are being ""impacted by delayed discharges"".
figure is down from nearly one in four the previous week, partly due to industrial action by ambulance workers on 21 December.
On the day of the strike, the proportion of patients waiting over an hour was 14% compared with an average across the week of 20%.
However the figures are well above the 4% for the equivalent week last year and 3% in 2020.
A total of 37% of handovers last week were delayed by at least 30 minutes, down from 41% the previous week but higher than the 13% recorded at this point in 2021 and 11% in 2020.
NHS trusts have a target of 95% of all ambulance handovers to be completed within 30 minutes, with 100% within 60 minutes.
Following Bristol & Weston and Gloucestershire in the proportion of patients waiting over an hour, were University Hospitals of North Midlands at 50% (307 of 619), Mid & South Essex at 46% (406 of 887), North Bristol at 44% (237 of 538) and Shrewsbury & Telford also at 44% (224 of 512).
NHS England said hospital capacities were being affected by delayed discharging of patients, with 12,313 beds a day taken up by patients who were ready to leave.
""Staff pulled out all the stops to ensure as many patients as possible were able to spend Christmas with loved ones at home,"" a spokesperson said, adding that the figure for delayed discharges was the lowest since August.
Hospitals are also facing pressure from a rise in winter viruses and patients testing positive for Covid-19.
Professor Mark Pietroni, director of safety and medical director at Gloucestershire Hospitals, said they were working to address the issues and had made some ""very significant improvements"" in reducing handover times.
""The health and care system in Gloucestershire remains under considerable pressure. This situation has been compounded by staffing challenges, resulting in unusually long waits relative to recent weeks. 
""It is important to stress that all patients arriving by ambulance and waiting to come into our emergency departments are assessed to ensure they are given the correct level of priority,"" he added.
University Hospitals Bristol & Weston has been approached for comment.
Meanwhile, health leaders in Bath and North East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire have said that delays in discharging patients is contributing to ""unprecedented demand"" on services.
re system is under ""intense pressure"" with record numbers in A&E. 
Chief nurse, Gill May, said: ""We are appealing to local people to help us get loved ones home from hospital, using the right health and care service when looking for support, practicing effective self-care, visiting pharmacies for help with minor ailments and following advice from NHS 111.""
Dr Jon Westbrook, chief medical officer at Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, added: ""We are asking the public to do all they can to support us at this extremely busy time.""

politics	MSPs propose more than 150 changes to gender bill	"More than 150 changes have been proposed to the new bill that would make it easier to legally change gender in Scotland. 
MSPs had until midday on Wednesday to submit amendments to the Gender Recognition Reform bill. 
gislation has already been approved in principle despite the biggest rebellion by SNP members since the party took power. 
roposed changes will now go before Holyrood's equalities committee.
It is expected to vote on them over the next two weeks.
Scottish government has argued that the current process for changing gender is too difficult and invasive.
w bill would remove the requirement for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria or medical reports.
It would also reduce the period in which applicants need to have lived in their acquired gender to three months.
One of the most controversial proposals is to lower the minimum age that someone can apply from 18 to 16.
Anyone wanting to change their legal gender will still need to swear an oath about remaining this way for life - with it being a criminal offence to make a false declaration or application - and there would be a three-month ""reflection period"" before a certificate was issued.
Most Conservatives are opposed to the legislation but Labour, Green and Liberal Democrat MSPs backed the reform bill at stage one. 
It was also supported by most SNP members but Ash Regan resigned as a minister and was one of seven SNP members to vote against. A further two abstained.

Scottish government's Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison has responded by proposing new powers to block fraudulent applications and those from people who appear to lack sufficient understanding. 
Others proposing amendments include SNP backbencher Christine Grahame who wants 16 and 17-year-old applicants to be required to live in their acquired gender for six months, rather than three. 
She also wants under-18s to demonstrate that they have sought appropriate advice. 
It is thought the Scottish government is sympathetic to Ms Grahame's proposals and has been in discussion with MSPs from across parties about other changes. 
Greens' Maggie Chapman wants to get rid of all time-related conditions, whereas Conservative amendments seek to retain the current two-year qualification period. 
ry MSPs also want to keep the requirement for a medical diagnosis and for any applicant to be at least 18 years old.

NHS GGC, which declined the move, said it was taking action to support staff.
It comes as both NHS Borders and NHS Grampian issued a plea to staff on leave to come into work, due to ""extreme pressure"" at hospitals.

""Our services, like the whole of Scotland, are facing major pressures including significant Covid, flu and norovirus cases and our staff are doing all they can to meet this demand.""
Both NHS Borders and NHS Grampian have put out an urgent call for any staff on leave to come into work.
NHS Grampian said it was facing ""an extreme level of pressure"" due to the number of acutely ill patients arriving at hospital and difficulties in discharging patients to the community .
NHS Borders also said its services were under ""extreme pressure"" and it had higher than normal staff sickness levels due to Covid and flu.
Meanwhile, NHS Lothian said the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, St John's Hospital, the Western General Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People were all at full capacity.

It was in July that Ms Ingram, 44,  from Calstock in Cornwall, donned her creation for the Bristol concert, where she was showered with admiring glances and curious questions from fellow gig-goers.
Ms Ingram, an instructor at Duchy College, was even ""photo-bombed"" by the Rocket Man himself.
Sir Elton, the fifth highest-selling recording artist of all time, is well known for his outrageous outfits including suits adorned with feathers and sequins.
Ms Ingram had ""tried to replicate"" a feathered coat she had seen the performer wear previously.
After meeting Amanda Hawkins in the crowd, Ms Ingram agreed to ""gift"" her the coat, as long as she promised to pass it on again. 
Ms Hawkins said the coat was the ""loveliest she'd ever seen"", adding: ""A few weeks later I took it to Glastonbury."" 
rue to her word, Ms Hawkins passed the coat on to Maria Janjua at Glastonbury Festival.
Ms Janjua said: ""I love the concept. Travelling around the world and bringing a bit of joy into people's lives.
""I love the fact it's being shared at festivals and concerts. Music helps connect us and brings us all together."" 
During Pearl Jam's set at Hyde Park's British Summer Time event, Ms Janjua found a new custodian in Charissa Armon, from Chicago, who had approached her with a compliment about the coat.
Ms Armon, a former actor who was on a European trip, said the coat represented ""connection and love"", adding: ""I felt extraordinarily honoured to be part of it.
""I hope it just keeps going and finds new countries and some day years in the future I'm at a show and see it across the arena.
""It's a sparkly reminder of how we are all right here together.""
At a Lady Gaga gig, Ms Armon could find no worthy owner, but persevered at a Killers concert in her hometown in September, where she presented the symbol of harmony to Rachel Christine, its current owner.
Ms Ingram said: ""I'm incredibly touched that so many lovely ladies have embraced the initial idea.
""My memory of the Elton concert is still such a fond one, so to have the coat of wings still spreading the love is fantastic.
""My aim is to get it back on stage with Sir Elton again, so it's gone full circle. Either that or to continue traveling around the world, being taken to awesome gigs and concerts by lovely people.""

health	Ambulance strike: Poor pay impacting our health, says worker	"Poor pay is affecting the health and wellbeing of some ambulance workers and their ability to do the job, according to one worker.
Ian James, 59, said voting in favour of strike action was difficult, but necessary to improve conditions.
GMB members of the ambulance service in Wales are striking on Wednesday in a dispute over pay.
Wales' health minister said people should only call 999 for serious emergencies during the strike.
Mr James is an emergency medical technician and has worked for the ambulance service for 30 years, as well as serving as a branch secretary for the union.
He cited examples of colleagues who at one time were able to have ""fresh vegetables and food on a regular basis to now having less quality foods - even to the point where some members of staff are having to use food banks"".
""That does seriously impact on your ability to function at the highest level, which you need when dealing with patients, the public, drugs, driving,"" he added.
""All those things are impacted by your health and wellbeing.""
Members of the GMB union - which makes up about a quarter of the ambulance service in Wales - are striking for 24 hours, ending at midnight on Wednesday. 
Welsh government has given workers an average pay rise of 4.75%, but with inflation running at more than 10%, unions say this represents a pay cut in real terms. 
Unison did not meet the threshold for industrial action in Wales, though it's expected to re-ballot its members in the new year, while the results of Unite's ballot is due later this week.
In England all three unions are taking action, though bosses in Wales are also preparing for non-GMB members to strike in support.
Calls to the service will still be answered and the most urgent, life-threatening calls - roughly 15% of the total call volume - will be responded to.
xpectation is that many patients - even those who are seriously ill - will simply not get an ambulance response.
Exemptions are also in place so that should the most urgent ""red calls"" come in, bosses can ask for striking crews to return to work, though staff can refuse.
At Pentwyn service station in Cardiff, all striking members were called away from the picket line on emergency calls.
Handover delays are often lengthy, Mr James said.
""The public can be assured that no life or limb would be put in jeopardy from a patient being left on the back of an ambulance, that will not happen,"" he explained.
""We would hand over that patient as safe and securely as possible.""
He said the current pressures on the service meant there were reduced opportunities to mentally process what they deal with, which in turn is affecting how long staff stay in the service.
""People put a brave face on a lot of things they do, particularly with the ambulance service, where they are dealing with catastrophic incidents on a regular basis.
""It used to be that you would 'depressurise' on station, but now handovers are so difficult that as soon as you come through that door they're looking to cover jobs.
""So you're straight on the vehicle, checking your equipment and straight out that door. You don't get the 'depressurisation' that we used to have.""
Sharon Thorpe, a relief paramedic for the Welsh Ambulance Service in Newport, called the action a ""necessity"" to preserve the service for patients.
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, she said: ""Actually putting that tick in that box for action was a massive decision for me.
""This is my 30th year in the ambulance service. We've had ballots before, and I've never ticked that box before, [but] there has been years of underfunding in the health service and its staff.
""To help people in their darkest times and then go home and possibly have to visit a foodbank to feed your children is unacceptable."" 
Ms Thorpe, a picket supervisor supporting striking colleagues, added: ""I don't think there is one of us here today who feels good about this, but it's a necessity. People in the NHS are the service, and the service will last as long as there are people to fight for it. 
""The service that we give our patients is, at the moment, not fulfilling what we would want. Patient experience is dire, staff are struggling. Things have to change.""
Richard Collyer, an emergency medical technician and GMB Union lead in Carmarthenshire, added that the current wage was having ""a massive effect on ourselves and our families financially because we can't support them as well as we should be"".
""I get paid £11.24 an hour. For the work that we do and the lives that we save and the trauma and the horrific things that we see on a daily basis, £11.24 is not enough.""
He added that the decision to walk out had been taken with ""a very heavy heart"".
Jason Killens, head of the Wales Ambulance Service, said about half of crews were working normally overnight and the other half were responding only to top tier emergencies or taking full strike action.
He added: ""Pressure on the service has been sustained and has been extreme for many months. Today, so far, we've seen activity perhaps be slightly kinder than we've seen in recent weeks."" 
He said while pleas for hospitals to free up ambulances quickly had been met, the impact was still significant.
""Patients are likely to continue to come to some degree of harm during the strike action. But the issue for us over the last few days has been planning as best we can for today to mitigate the impact of the action,"" he said. 
He suggested that factors beyond pay, such as workplace environment, long handover delays outside hospitals and late finishes had influenced some workers' decisions and urged unions and ministers to ""get round the table"".
""I do have sympathy with them for the circumstances they're working in. It is deeply frustrating for them and for me because we can't provide the service that people need,"" he added.
Welsh government said about 2,800 outpatient appointments and 250 planned operations were postponed in Wales on Tuesday.
It said that did not reflect the full impact on planned NHS care, as fewer operations and appointments were booked in than normal.
Health Minister Eluned Morgan said people should not add extra pressure on services on strike days and consider carefully what activities they take part in.
""There's no doubt the two days of industrial action, following hard on the heels of action by nurses which have caused a delay in treatment for thousands of patients in Wales, are going to cause huge pressure on ambulance services. Ambulances will only be able to respond to the most urgent calls on strike days,"" she said.
""It's important to call 999 if you are in immediate danger, but we must all consider very carefully how we use ambulance services on these days.""

entertainment	BBC World Service proposes 382 post closures as part of savings	"BBC is proposing to close about 382 posts at the World Service as it tries to make £28.5m in annual savings for its international services.
Radio broadcasts in 10 languages including Arabic, Persian, Chinese and Bengali will cease, the BBC said.
Although no language services will close, many will move online, to ""increase impact with audiences"".
BBC is also making wider annual savings of £500m, with CBBC and BBC Four also scheduled to move online.
In January former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries announced the licence fee would be frozen at £159 for two years. 
, combined with high inflation and soaring costs ""have led to tough choices,"" the corporation said. 
It added that the plans for the World Service support its strategy to create a ""modern, digital-led and streamlined organisation"".
r radio services that will end are Kyrgyz, Uzbek, Hindi, Indonesian, Tamil, and Urdu.
guages that will become online-only are Chinese, Gujarati, Igbo, Indonesian, Pidgin, Urdu, and Yoruba. 
World Service is an international multimedia broadcaster, delivering a wide range of language and regional services on radio, TV, and digital. It currently reaches 364 million people a week - about half of whom access it online. 
No language services will close, and the World Service will still ""serve audiences during moments of jeopardy"", ensuring that people in countries including Russia, Ukraine and Afghanistan will still be able to access the BBC's news services.
World Service English will also continue to provide around-the-clock news, available globally, and the corporation said it would announce new scheduling, programmes and podcasts at a later date.
Liliane Landor, the World Service's director, said: ""The role of the BBC has never been more crucial worldwide. The BBC is trusted by hundreds of millions of people for fair and impartial news, especially in countries where this is in short supply. 
""We help people in times of crisis. We will continue to bring the best journalism to audiences in English and more than 40 languages, as well as increasing the impact and influence of our journalism by making our stories go further.""
She added that there was a ""compelling case"" to expand digital services. 
World Service English will also invest in a new podcast for younger audiences globally, along with an hour-long science strand from the BBC's new science unit in Cardiff, plus more live news and sports programming. 
Other proposals include:  
roposals will now be subject to consultation with staff and trade unions. Philippa Childs, head of broadcasting union Bectu, said they were ""disappointed to see the proposed changes"". 
She added: ""While we recognise the BBC must adapt to meet the challenges of a changing media landscape, once again it is workers who are hit by the government's poorly-judged political decisions - its freezing of the licence fee and the resulting funding challenges has necessitated these proposals."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63072977
politics	General Election: When is the next one and could it be called sooner?	"Rishi Sunak is to be the UK's next prime minister, following the withdrawal of Tory leadership rivals Penny Mordaunt and Boris Johnson.  
Opposition politicians have been leading calls for a general election, following Liz Truss's resignation.
So, why is there a new prime minister without an election?
UK general elections - where all 650 MPs are elected to the House of Commons - have to be held no more than five years apart.
Unless an earlier one is called, the next election isn't due until January 2025. 
represents five years from the day the current Parliament first met (17 December 2019), plus the time required for an election campaign.
rly election usually rests with the prime minister.
However, until very recently, this wasn't the case. 
In 2011, a law was passed that removed the PM's power to hold an early election and instead handed control to the House of Commons. Under those rules an early election could only be held under certain circumstances - such as if two-thirds of MPs agreed to one. 
However, after winning the 2019 election, the Conservatives introduced a new law - called the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022. This restored the PM's traditional power to call elections at a time of their choosing.
If a PM wants an early election they need to make a ""request"" to the King to dissolve Parliament - the official term for closing Parliament in order to hold an election.
Once an election is called, polling day would be expected to take place 25 working days later.
At the point of dissolution, MPs lose their status and campaign for re-election (assuming they choose to stand again).
Not in constitutional terms. Twice in the 20th Century there were occasions when the prime minister was replaced twice without a general election being called.
Stanley Baldwin won the 1935 election and was then replaced by Neville Chamberlain in 1937 who in turn resigned in 1940 to be replaced by Winston Churchill. But that was in an emergency situation while World War Two was being fought and there was no general election until 1945.
Also after the 1900 election there were two changes of prime minister before the next election in 1906, although Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman called a general election as soon as he became prime minister.
re have been several occasions when new prime ministers did not call early general elections to seek a fresh mandate.  
When Gordon Brown took over from Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2007, for example, he did not hold an early election. Boris Johnson became PM in July 2019, but didn't call an election until December. Theresa May became prime minister in 2016 but did not call an election until 2017. 
Of course, there will be a great deal of political pressure on the new prime minister to call an election, particularly as the current government is so far behind in opinion polls. 
A prime minister must have the ""confidence"" of the House of Commons, which means they must be supported by a majority of MPs.
A motion of no confidence would see MPs from all parties decide whether they want the government to continue.
If Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer introduced such a motion, convention means that the government should provide time for a debate and a vote.
In order to pass, the motion needs just one more MP voting in favour than against.
If the government loses the vote, a general election would normally be called. 
It is also possible that the King could invite somebody else to form a government - someone who could win a vote of confidence in the House of Commons.
However, for a no confidence motion to pass, Conservative MPs would need to vote down their own government - something many would be very unlikely to do.
Conservatives' current working majority is 71. "	/news/uk-politics-62064552
entertainment	Duran Duran star Andy Taylor has stage four cancer	"Duran Duran's original guitarist Andy Taylor has been diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer.
musician revealed the diagnosis in a letter read by his former bandmates as they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Saturday.
was meant to be as a reunion for the band, whose classic line-up has not played together since 2006.
r said he was ""massively disappointed"" to miss the show, and had ""bought a new guitar"" for the occasion.
Singer Simon Le Bon read Taylor's letter to the audience, which read: ""Just over four years ago I was diagnosed with stage four metastatic prostate cancer. 
""Many families have experienced the slow burn of this disease and of course we are no different; so I speak from the perspective of a family man but with profound humility to the band, the greatest fans a group could have and this exceptional accolade.""
r, who was born in Tynemouth, wrote that he was receiving ""sophisticated life-extending treatment"", but had recently suffered a ""setback,"" that prevented him travelling to Los Angeles for the ceremony.
""Although my current condition is not immediately life-threatening there is no cure,"" he added.
Formed in Birmingham, Duran Duran were one of the biggest pop bands of the 1980s, known for their lavish videos and danceable, synthesized pop singles.
were first band to be inducted at this year's Hall of Fame concert, and opened the show with a hit-packed medley that included Girls On Film, Hungry Like The Wolf and Ordinary World.
Dolly Parton, Eminem, Lionel Richie, Eurythmics, Pat Benatar, Eminem, Carly Simon, Harry Belafonte and Judas Priest were also added to the Hall of Fame roster.
Parton, whose hits include Jolene, I Will Always Love You and 9 To 5, initially rejected her nomination, saying she didn't think country music was eligible, but later relented.
""I'm a rock star now!"" she said during her acceptance speech. 
""Back when they said they were going to induct me into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I didn't really think that I'd done enough to deserve that. I didn't understand at the time. But this is a very, very special night for me.""
Afterwards, the singer performed a star-studded version of Jolene, joined by Pat Benatar, Eurythmics' singer Annie Lennox, Simon Le Bon, Brandi Carlile, and Judas Priest's Rob Halford.
Eminem was inducted by Dr Dre, who said almost everyone he knew had tried to discourage him from working with a white rapper.
But ""I knew that his gifts were undeniable,"" Dre said. ""Each of us was what the other one needed - and I was willing to bet my entire career on it.""
Eminem, real name Marshall Mathers, used his speech to namecheck the rappers who had influenced him, from pioneers Tupac, Chuck D, Outkast and Snoop Dogg to more underground names like Lord Finesse and JJ Fad.
He did so partly to highlight the Hall of Fame's lack of recognition for hip-hop (he is only the ninth rap act to be inducted alongside Run DMC, NWA, Jay-Z, LL Cool J, Biggie Smalls, Tupac Shakur, Public Enemy, Beastie Boys and Grandmaster Flash).
""Those were my rock stars, man,"" said the musician. ""And I just want to say, those are just a few of the names that I hope will be considered in the future for induction. Because without them, a lot of us wouldn't be here. I know I wouldn't.""
Eminem went on to perform his hits My Name Is, Rap God and Sing for the Moment - the latter accompanied by Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, who was sampled on the original song.
He then brought out Ed Sheeran for a live rendition of Stan.
""I'm not supposed to be here tonight,"" said Eminem following his set. ""One, I'm a rapper; two, I almost died from an overdose; and three, I really had to fight my way through… I'm a high school drop-out with a hip-hop education.""
Janet Jackson inducted her long-time collaborators, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.
uo started out in the Prince side project The Time before becoming one of America's most prominent production teams, writing hits like the SOS Band's Just Be Good To Me, Mary J Blige's No More Drama, Usher's U Remind Me and almost all of Jackson's singles, including What Have You Done For Me Lately, Rhythm Nation, That's The Way Love Goes and Together Again.
""I feel like we broke through the music industry together,"" said Jackson ""They taught me so much, and I learned their lessons well.
""When I went to work on what became Control in their hometown of Minneapolis, there was pressure. We felt like we were kids in a sandbox… We talked and laughed so much that sometimes it didn't even feel like we were making a record.""
British metal band Judas Priest took the stage with estranged guitarist KK Downing, who in 2011, playing classics like You've Got Another Thing Comin', Breaking The Law and Living After Midnight.
""I'm the gay guy in the band,"" said frontman Rob Halford. 
""We call ourselves the heavy metal community, which is all-inclusive, no matter what your sexual identity is, what you look like, or what you believe in or don't believe in. Everybody's welcome.""
Eurythmics were inducted by U2's the Edge, Lionel Richie by Lenny Kravitz, and Carly Simon by Sara Bareilles.
Simon, whose two younger sisters both died in recent weeks, declined to perform, but Barailles took her place, singing Nobody Does It Better, followed by Olivia Rodrigo who delivered a strutting version of You're So Vain.

Scott Conway bagged a double for the hosts with Mark Cooper, Lewis Hook, Ben Lake and Ciaran Long also on target. 
Stephen McParland scored twice - one a penalty shot - for the Scots along with a Jordan Cownie strike. 
ry, in front of a season-best 6,500 crowd, sees the champions remain fourth in the Elite League with Glasgow staying firmly rooted to the bottom.  
Giants made a bright start with Jeff Baum testing Clan goaltender John Muse before Darik Angeli almost completed a mazy dribble with a goal five minutes into the contest.  
Glasgow weathered that early storm and Stephen Dixon rattled the Giants post before the home side took the initiative. 
Cooper finished at the far post, set up by fine approach play by David Goodwin and Conway, to give the Giants the lead heading into the first interval.
Clan equalised midway through the second period after McParland was hooked back by Will Cullen.  The Glasgow forward got up to convert the ensuing penalty shot past Jackson Whistle.  
wo penalties called against the Clan - Andrew McLean for holding and Mitch Jones for cross checking - were to prove very costly for the visitors.  
Belfast's leading goalscorer Conway slammed home while the Giants were on the five-on-three power play. 
Still with a man advantage, the Giants swiftly made it 3-1, carving open the beleaguered Clan defence as Hook scored with a simple finish in front of the net.

McParland broke free to reduce Glasgow's arrears nine minutes into the final period. Cownie then added another for 4-3 to set up a tense finish to the match.

Anglian Water admitted failures in managing its water recycling centre near Brentwood in Essex.
ution killed fish along a 3km (1.8 miles) stretch of the River Wid in 2018, the Environment Agency said. 
District Judge Sam Goozee described Anglian Water's record as ""lamentable"".
ffence of causing water discharge activity took place between 27 September and 2 October 2018.
Chelmsford Magistrates' Court was told a fault in an aeration process at the Doddinghurst water recycling centre at Wyatts Green meant 3.9 million litres of sewage was discharged into Doddinghurst Brook - a tributary of the River Wid.
It went unchecked for nearly three days, damaging the river's ecosystem and killing a number of a protected fish species, including the freshwater bullhead, the agency said.
It added that the pollution could been avoided had Anglian Water spent £205 on software for an early alarm system. 
It was the second time in six months that Anglian Water had been fined for polluting the same stretch, the agency said.
water company, whose headquarters are in Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, was also ordered to pay costs of £27,439.21 and a victim surcharge of £170.
Environment Agency officer Gavin Senior said the public demanded tough action when it came to water quality.  
""The invertebrate and fish population in this area, including a protected species, suffered significantly because of this sewage pollution and it took time for the local ecosystem to recover,"" he said. 
In a statement, Anglian Water said it ""deeply regretted any negative impact"" and had donated £60,000 to the Essex and Suffolk Rivers Trust.
""We take our duty of care to the environment incredibly seriously ..  and find it deeply distressing when incidents like this occur,"" the company said.
""We know there's no room for complacency, and we're absolutely determined to improve further and progress towards achieving our zero pollutions goal.""

business	Drivers cut back on journeys as fuel costs bite	"Fuel sales have fallen as drivers cut back on the number of journeys they make due to higher pump prices, a petrol station operator has said.
Ascona Group, which owns 60 UK petrol stations, said the amount of fuel it sold had dropped by 200,000 litres a week compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Managing director Darren Briggs said customers were making £20 to £30 fuel purchases ""last a little bit longer"".
Prices have reached record highs recently due to high oil prices.
rice of Brent crude oil - the global benchmark for prices - has soared in recent months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised concerns of potential global supply issues.
Ahead of the invasion, fuel prices had already been rising after demand increased following the reopening of economies from coronavirus lockdowns.
Office for National Statistics revealed on Thursday that the UK's economy shrank by 0.1% in March and said higher prices, including those at the petrol pumps, were ""really beginning to bite"".
Ascona Group's Mr Briggs, which employs about 800 staff, told the BBC's Today programme that fuel sales volumes had been down by between 6-8% over the past six weeks.
""Pre-Covid we would retail around about 2.8 million litres a week, we're down to about 2.6 (million),"" he said.
""We are seeing our customers making that £20-£30 purchase of fuel last a little bit longer.""
According to the RAC, every mile driven now costs 18.5p for petrol and 20p for diesel.
Unleaded petrol is currently at £1.65 a litre on average, up 2.75p since 1 May, while diesel is at £1.79, a fraction off the previous record high set on 23 March.
Rod Dennis, of the RAC, said the ""cost of living crisis is undoubtedly having a very real effect"" on drivers using their cars.
He said the fall in sales chimed with recent research conducted by the motoring group which showed 30% of drivers were driving less often and 21% said they were ""deliberately"" driving more efficiently to save fuel.
""Unfortunately, as a result of yet more increases in the wholesale cost of fuel in recent days we're likely to see pump prices rise even further in the coming weeks, increasing the squeeze on households,"" he added.
In response to higher fuel prices, earlier this year the government cut fuel duty on petrol and diesel by 5p per litre. It has said the reduction, which will last for a year, will help drivers cope with rising fuel costs.
But Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said that people had already started spending less in shops and were cutting down on car journeys due to the high cost of fuel at the pumps in March.
wnturn in March came ahead of the impact of higher energy bills in April, which has sparked fears from analysts that the UK economy is at risk of a recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods - later this year.
Last week, the Bank of England forecast that inflation - the rate at which prices rise - could reach more than 10% by the end of the year.
Dame DeAnne Julius, a former member of the Bank's monetary policy committee, which sets interest rates, said the UK economy would be ""close if it actually doesn't actually go into recession"".
""My hunch is that the Bank of England's forecast is a little bit on the gloomy side, but time will tell,"" she said.
Dame DeAnne said the main reason inflation was rising was because of ""global issues"" such as the Ukraine war, with Ukraine being a large exporter of food and Russia a large exporter of energy.
She said the Bank had ""no alternative"" but to raise interest rates.
""Recession sounds a very scary word but actually what we are talking about is a sort of flat-lining for a period as consumers re-adjust. As they re-adjust to [buying]  cheaper food or to saving energy more carefully,"" she added. 
""The economy fundamentally is pretty solid, the banks are in good shape. We are not about to go into something like the 2008 financial crisis."""	/news/business-61433722

technology	Data mast plan for Pembrokeshire national park rejected	"Plans for a data mast in a national park have been rejected by officials. 
Britannia Towers II Ltd wanted to build the 51m (167ft) tower in Pantmaenog Forest near Rosebush in Pembrokeshire Coast National Park.
It sparked opposition from people living nearby who said it would harm tourism and bring no benefits to the area. 
Planners for the authority agreed, saying the adverse impact of the proposal was ""unacceptable"". 
In its decision, Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority said the mast would have an ""unacceptable adverse impact"" on the landscape which were ""not outweighed by the potential community benefits suggested"".
wer, along with associated transmission dishes and an equipment shed, would have been visible on an area of ""heath and moorland"" in Preseli hills.
Maenclochog Community Council formally objected to the plan, questioning how a tower linking a finance company in London to Ireland would benefit anyone locally. 
Dutch data network firm behind the proposal, Wholesailor, said this was the ideal location and it ""urgently needed planning granted"".
Campiagner Jess Wallace said the area had been ""a sacred landscape for thousands of years"".
""Seventy-five years ago, the local residents fought off the MoD [Ministry of Defence] who wanted to appropriate this landscape,"" she said, calling the development an incursion ""on what is a pristine landscape""."	/news/uk-wales-63315921

technology	Why did Elon Musk get cold feet on Twitter?	"Elon Musk's offer to buy Twitter was initially met with resistance.
In fact, Twitter evoked a ""poison pill"" provision to stop Musk from forcibly buying the company. 
Eventually the company accepted the offer - a deal that Musk greeted with a one word tweet. ""Yesss!!!""
A few weeks later though, Mr Musk appeared to have developed buyer's remorse. Having done all the running, having got what he wanted, he now had some questions. 
""Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of users"" he tweeted..
Mr Musk was arguing that Twitter had no way of verifying how many of its 229m daily active users were actually human. 
witter's CEO, Parag Agrawal, answered back with a 13-tweet thread - publicly stating that fewer than 5% of its accounts were bots. 
Elon Musk responded with a turd emoji. 
was on 16 May, and it appears not much has changed since then. 
In Musk's filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday he said he had ""repeatedly"" requested further information on spam accounts - data that was not forthcoming. 
Yet sceptics argue that Musk's interest in bots is a distraction. 
witter is well known for having a significant number of fake accounts. 
In fact, Twitter announced on Thursday that it removes a million bot accounts every day. 
witter would readily have admitted it had a relatively small but persistent bot problem before Musk put in an offer. 
Instead it's posited that bot and spam accounts are being weaponised by Musk, as an exit ramp out of this deal. 
When Musk first looked into buying Twitter the tech economy was in a very different place. 
At the end of March Tesla stock, which is the driver of most of Musk's fortune, was worth well over $1,000 (£830) a share. 
Musk was feeling bullish. But since April, Tesla has lost about a third of its value. Many other tech stocks have also done poorly. 
Musk's deal - that valued Twitter at $44bn (£36bn) - started to seem a little steep. 
Many Tesla shareholders also began to worry that Musk's time, already spread between his companies Neuralink, Space X, the Boring Company and Tesla, would be spread even thinner with the acquisition of Twitter. It's difficult to see how it wouldn't. 
Musk had other problems too. He claimed he wanted to take over Twitter because it had lost its way. He wanted Twitter to champion ""free speech"". 
And yet he struggled to define how he was going to effectively moderate the platform to that end. 
""By 'free speech', I simply mean that which matches the law,"" he tweeted. 
But critics argued that that definition was naive. For one it would encourage countries to pass laws that restricted free speech. It would also cause a moderation nightmare - with different tweets being assessed in real-time for whether they broke the law (or not) in hundreds of jurisdictions.
And then there was Twitter itself. Musk never ingratiated himself to the bulk of Twitter's employees. He said that Twitter clearly had a ""left wing bias"" and joked that its head office could be used as a homeless shelter. Many Twitter workers were worried that his swashbuckling approach could undo years of carefully-thought-out moderation policy. 
And as for Mr Musk's plan for Twitter? Well he had an ambitious growth forecast. In fact, he claimed he wanted to grow Twitter's userbase from 200 million to over 900 million in 2028. 
Yet there was no clear vision of how he was going to do that. It felt like numbers picked almost at random.
Musk's critics, he had bought a company at a high price, a company whose employees mostly didn't like him, and a company that he had struggled to present a coherent vision for. 
upporters, Musk was going to change Twitter for the better. Donald Trump would be invited back. Twitter's overzealous restrictions on free speech would be reined in. Its inherent left-wing bias would be addressed. Mr Musk may now never get the chance to enact that change. 
But this deal isn't over.
witter has already claimed that Musk is legally committed to buying the company - at the price agreed. 
witter board member Bret Taylor has said they will take the matter to court. 
It raises the bizarre spectre that Elon Musk could, unwillingly, end up buying a $44 billion company - an extraordinary thing. 
A lot is still on the line. One thing is pretty clear though, this story is about more than bots.

business	No going back to reliance on Russian gas from here	". Russia's state-controlled gas giant announced an indefinite extension to a three-day maintenance halt to flows of gas through the continent's key energy artery, hours after leading western finance ministers vowed to escalate sanctions on Russian oil.
Gazprom's official reason is that an oil leak has been found and the pipeline cannot work without German imports of technology, which are now subject to sanctions. 
Few observers believe, however, that this is anything other than an attempt essentially to blackmail Europe over supplies.
G7 world's main economies, including the UK, agreed to cap the price they pay for oil from Russia. This is a way to limit the revenues that fund the Kremlin's war in Ukraine - it earns more from oil exports than gas.
But this is a very serious development. Even during the height of the Cold War, Russia kept supplies of its gas flowing into Europe.
ut-off though - and the pointed attempt by Gazprom to blame the German energy giant Siemens for the malfunction - is the culmination of decades of dysfunction in the energy relationship between Russia and Germany. 
For most of that time, of course, Bonn and then Berlin were delighted to avail themselves of cheap Russian gas. 
A younger Vladimir Putin did his PhD thesis on the importance of Russian energy exports. 
When I visited Gazprom's headquarters a decade ago and its fields in Siberia, I was told menacingly ""anyone who artificially tries to diminish the role of Russian gas is playing a very dangerous game"". A visit to the Novi Urengoy field showed Gazprom consolidating its hold on the Russian state, with some assistance from Berlin.
Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder enshrined this dependence with the building of this same Nordstream pipeline, which then gave him a job on its board. Gazprom sponsored German football, Europe's premier football competition the Champions League, and bankrolled various Russian soft power projects.
Perhaps most incredibly, German industry swapped the gas storage facilities under its soil for privileged access to deep-lying gas reserves under the Siberian tundra. 
ry facilities, including Germany's largest, designed for resilience in the face of Russian energy diplomacy were passed into Russian ownership. It beggars belief that this was completed in 2015, after Russia's annexation of Crimea.
One sliver of hope, though, now lies in those same storage facilities. The German government seized ownership of the storage facilities that had been left at very low levels last year. 
re, and across the continent, energy companies backed by government loans have spent the summer buying up as much gas as possible at any price. 
major economies are now on course to fill massive stores of gas, designed to cope with a cut to supplies of several weeks. Germany's huge stores are now 84% full, having been less than half full in June.
As a result, gas prices traded in international markets have come down from extreme highs over the past week. But they are still very high by normal standards. 
re remains a dash to secure alternative supplies that is pushing up the price for all countries, including Britain. And the true impact of all this will depend on just how long the pipeline outage lasts.
But surely now, for Germany and the rest of Europe, there will be no going back to reliance on Russia."	/news/business-62779909
business	Energy firms warn against extending windfall tax to renewables	"Energy firms are warning that an attempt to extend a windfall tax to renewable energy would threaten the government's entire energy strategy. 
Industry sources told the BBC it could destroy investor confidence ahead of key auctions for licences to develop new wind and solar projects. 
Shares in firms that could be affected fell sharply on Tuesday, with Centrica down 11% and SSE 9% lower. 
An announcement on windfall taxes could come as soon as Thursday.
However, the Treasury said no decisions had yet been made. 
Oil and gas prices have soared over the past year, partly because demand has increased as the world emerges from the Covid pandemic and because of supply concerns due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
windfall tax could also hit electricity generators, including renewable energy operators, was first reported by the Financial Times.
Sources close to the Treasury's thinking on how to impose a windfall tax point out that renewable and nuclear energy generators have also enjoyed windfall profits as electricity prices have also surged and they have enjoyed extra profits as they are not dependent on expensive gas to produce power.
""Power producers whose costs haven't risen with the price of gas have enjoyed a windfall as well. It is logical and credible for them to be taxed on their excess profits as well,"" said one source. 
Energy experts also point out that there is no reason future investment in renewables should suffer, as they would be exempt from any windfall tax as projects are now auctioned with a fixed price for the power they ultimately produce and therefore it would be impossible for the companies to make excess profits if prices for electricity rise. Any windfall tax would be levied on older existing renewable income. 
However, the boss of one of the UK's biggest investors in renewables said his profits from renewable energy generation were in the low hundreds of millions for a whole year, compared to the £7bn made by Shell and the £5bn made by BP in the first three months of this year alone.
""Going after renewables is total and utter nonsense,"" he said. 
government's energy strategy, which was announced last month, aimed to boost UK energy independence and tackle rising prices.
Under the plans, up to eight more nuclear reactors could be approved on existing sites, and the strategy also aims to increase wind, hydrogen and solar production."	/news/business-61566083
entertainment	Maxine Peake stages Betty Boothroyd's life in comedy musical: 'This is me letting rip'	"first female Speaker of the House of Commons is having her life story told on stage - but rather than being a dry political drama, it sees actor Maxine Peake sing in her first musical and return to her comedy roots.
Betty Boothroyd never fulfilled her youthful dreams of high-kicking her way to showbiz stardom.
She discovered she wasn't cut out to be a chorus-line showgirl at the London Palladium, so her stint as a member of the Tiller Girls dance troupe after World War Two was short-lived.
But her flair for performing wasn't wasted.
She moved onto a different public stage when she pursued her other passion, politics, and ended up with a starring role in the House of Commons as the first Madam Speaker from 1992 to 2000.
Betty Boothroyd's pitch to become the first woman Speaker in 1992
""Politicians, like Tiller Girls, are public performers,"" she wrote in her autobiography. ""They forget it at their peril.""
Maxine Peake agrees. ""The worlds of politics and theatre, I think, do collide,"" she says. ""My granddad always used to say to me, 'Politicians, Maxine, are frustrated actors.' And she really has that charisma and presence.""
Betty (now Baroness) Boothroyd is admired for the way she worked the crowd in the Commons. That has inspired Peake and co-writer and co-star Seiriol Davies to tell her life story on stage.
""We just felt she was someone to celebrate,"" Peake says. ""You look at her achievements. It's what she stands for, and her work ethic, what she achieved, what her beliefs were. 
""And then when you start with somebody who used to be a Tiller Girl, you think, well, this could be fun, especially for a musical.""
As well as deciding against the predictable idea of a straight and serious biographical play, the title of Peake and Davies's show suggests it isn't quite a regular musical either.
Betty! A Sort of Musical opened at Manchester's Royal Exchange theatre on Saturday. The ""sort of"" in the name refers to the fact it's a show within a show - following an amateur dramatic group in Lady Boothroyd's home town of Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, who are themselves attempting to stage a musical about their local heroine.
Each member of the fictional Dewsbury Players takes turns to portray Lady Boothroyd and perform a song about a different stage of her life. Each tune goes on a different flight of fantasy, with Grease and James Bond-themed numbers and a Queen-inspired Boothroydian Rhapsody.
""If we're in a Bond film or a kitchen sink drama, they all then get elevated to the level of absurdity,"" Davies explains.
He adds: ""We make no promises that things are biographically factually correct, although we think there is some truth in all of the moments. But it is not a bio-musical. It is a musical about people making myths about a woman they love.""
Davies says he was inspired by Lady Boothroyd's general ""fabulousness"" as well as her ""explicit glamour and showmanship"".
On top of that: ""I think she's a unifying figure. If someone has heard of Betty, the chances are they'll at least admire her, or if not, be slightly obsessed with her.
""But if someone hasn't heard of her, I just have to tell them she used to be kick-line chorus girl and the KGB tried to honeytrap her, and then she rose to the second-highest commoner rank in the land or whatever.
""That is a story, whatever side your bread is buttered politically.""
racters in the Dewsbury am-dram group have their bread buttered on various sides, but they agree Lady Boothroyd is, as Peake believes too, a symbol of democratic respectability and stability compared with today's politicians.
""She unified the House of Commons with her skill and wit and intelligence. I felt very much I've missed that.""
Peake plays Meredith Ankle, matriarch of the am-dram group and owner of Ankle Carpets. It's hard not to detect the influence of Victoria Wood - who gave Peake her first break in Dinnerladies - in the way she is mining humour from the most mundane situations.
""She's such a big inspiration, even before I worked with her, growing up,"" Peake says of her late mentor.
Betty! is a return to comedy for Peake, who has gone on to forge her career mainly in serious (and often harrowing) dramas like Three Girls, about the Rotherham child sex grooming scandal; Anne, playing Hillsborough campaigner Anne Williams; and Mike Leigh's historical tub-thumper Peterloo.
""Initially, I wasn't Meredith when we first started writing,"" Peake says. ""And then the more I wrote, the more I really wanted to play Meredith, because it's something I've been crying out to do for a long time.
""I started in comedy, and I thought that's where I'd continue. And then I sort of went, 'Oh I'd like to try some straight, serious drama.' And then I couldn't quite get back. So this is me letting rip.
""As a youngster, that's what I thought my career would be, as I got into middle age. But there's not as many of those parts written now for women - those larger-than-life funny women. We've lost Victoria Wood.""
w show also requires Peake to sing. Has she been in a musical before? ""Have I heck. I'm not a singer.""
She is, it must be noted, in a band called The Eccocentric Research Council, although her vocal delivery with them is more like spoken word. ""Sort of"" musical again.
""What is nice, at the grand old age of 48, is going, OK, I'm going to do something where I sing, and there's ways around it, and I've learned so much.""
Lady Boothroyd isn't the first politician to get the musical treatment. Evita and Hamilton haven't done badly, but recent shows about British political figures have had mixed results.
Like with Betty!, an exclamation mark was deployed for Tony! (The Tony Blair Rock Opera), co-written by comedian Harry Hill. Blair is more divisive, and the show was less affectionate and less subtle. ""The show struggles to shift out of a cartoon register,"" The Telegraph said.
Veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner was the subject of The Palace of Varieties, and setting his ""colourful Commons battles"" to a soundtrack of music hall and Broadway songs ""makes surprising sense"", The Guardian said.
Skinner makes an appearance in Betty! too. This time, the Beast of Bolsover and Madam Speaker perform a verbal joust in the form of a rap battle.
Betty! also completes something of a trilogy for Peake, who has previously written plays about two other pioneering real-life women - champion cyclist Beryl Burton and Hull fishwife Lillian Bilocca. Like Lady Boothroyd, both are from Yorkshire.
""I feel slightly traitorous to my Lancashire roots,"" jokes Peake, from Bolton. ""There's been a theme of writing things about inspirational women from working class backgrounds in the north.""
Both Burton and Bilocca were dead by the time Peake came to pay homage. Lady Boothroyd, now 93, is very much with us. What does she think about her life being given this fantastical treatment?
Peake says she says has been ""very supportive"".
""Because you worry, don't you? You think, what would she think? But she seemed really pleased about it. We've assured her it's a celebration.""
Betty! A Sort of Musical is at the Royal Exchange theatre in Manchester until 14 January."	/news/entertainment-arts-63775575
technology	The flying car that could turn into a biplane	"At a launch event at Draper University in San Mateo, California, a start-up revealed how its flying car hopes to take off.
Alef bills its still-in-development electric vehicle, the Model A, as the first true flying car - a vehicle that it hopes will look like a sleek electric car but be capable of vertical take-off, and able to fly for 110km (68 miles).
firm hopes to compete in a market occupied by well-advanced rivals, such as AirCar and the Pal-V gyrocopter that are already flying and driving.
But Jim Dukhovny, Alef's chief executive and co-founder, argues most existing vehicles are not strictly flying cars in his opinion.
""A flying car has to be a car, which means it can drive on a regular street, park in a regular parking space. And it also should have vertical take-off,"" he told the BBC.
""If you require an airport to take-off, what problem are you solving? And why is this a flying car?""
urface of the Model A's car-like exterior is a mesh so that air can pass through to eight propellers inside the body which provide lift.
But flying any distance using these alone, without the assistance of wings, would require prohibitive amounts of power.
Alef's proposed solution is novel - for longer flights the Model A transforms into a biplane.
After a vertical lift-off, the Model A will turn onto its side, the two-person cockpit swivels so the driver remains facing forward, and the car becomes a biplane with the long sides of the vehicle forming the top and bottom wings.
, with two wings, one on top of the other, is easier to see in the Model A if you imagine the mesh in-between the solid sides being removed. Alef has also produced a video visualising the transition.
Forbes observed that the way it would fly resembles the Opener Blackfly, an existing vertical take-off electric aircraft. 
It's an ingenious idea, but is it a practical one?
Bringing flying and driving together adds weight, electric power also means heavy batteries. 
""The design is right on the ragged edge of what the physics and technology can do, which is where you would expect it to be,"" says aeronautical engineer Professor Steve Wright of the University of the West of England.
mesh, as visualised, might also cause significant aerodynamic drag, he adds.
Alef says it has managed the transition to biplane in ""scaled flights"" since 2018. And it has large prototypes capable of vertical flight - though they don't yet resemble the polished appearance of the firm's mock-ups and concepts.
But Prof Wright warns the jump from a prototype to a working product is easily underestimated.
urdles are only one obstacle to building highways in the sky busy with flying cars.
regulation and certification of flying cars is likely to be rigorous, time-consuming and expensive, as it is for any aircraft.
fly a biplane, even one that you can drive on the roads, will require a pilots licence - though Mr Dukhovny envisions that for short low-level hops over obstacles using vertical flight, a licence used for drone operators might suffice.
And authorities are likely to impose strict rules on where vehicles can be flown.
For these and other reasons, Prof Wright thinks the future of flying cars will not be a single vehicle that consumers own, drive and fly.
In the film Back to the Future, the character Doc Brown's fusion-powered DeLorean car leaves the road and swoops into the air.
""That isn't how mass airborne transport is going to play out, which is a real shame. I really want my flying DeLorean as much as anybody does,"" Prof Wright says.
In reality, travelling by flying car, Prof Wright argues, would be more like hiring a taxi.
""You pull out your phone, and a robot car would draw up and it would take you to somewhere the size of a small park and the drone comes down, sets itself down, you jump in there. So in other words, you summon a drone taxi.""
Many companies are developing autonomous passenger drones. Recently Chinese firm Xpeng gave its first public demonstration of its X2 vehicle in Dubai. 
But Mr Dukhovny strongly believes that the idea of being able to drive and fly in the same vehicle is an attractive one. When I ask him who will pay the Model A's initial $300,000 (£266,000) price tag, he says ""early adopters"". 
He says people have been waiting for a flying car for a 100 years. Alef's ambitious goal is to start selling vehicles in 2025. "	/news/technology-63325341

politics	Lib Dems urge ministers to ban home repossessions over Christmas	"Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has called on the government to ban banks from repossessing people's homes over the holiday period.
usands of families are facing a ""nightmare before Christmas"" as mortgage rates soar, warned Sir Ed.
He is also demanding immediate action to protect private renters from eviction in England.
government said it had met with lenders to ensure they support mortgage holders in financial difficulty.
Lib Dem proposals include a temporary ban on home repossession, between now and 31 December, along similar lines to a ban that was in place during the pandemic.
re also calling for a new Mortgage Protection Fund, which would provide temporary grants to those most at risk of repossession.
Sir Ed said: ""The Conservative government put hundreds of pounds on people's mortgages through their disastrous mini-budget. The very least they could now do is to take responsibility for fixing this mess and protecting homeowners on the brink.""
He added: ""No-one should face losing their home this Christmas because the Conservative government crashed the economy.""
government figures show mortgage possession claims in the courts reached 3,680 between July and September, a 30% increase on the same period last year, although they are still lower than before the pandemic.
Rates on new fixed-rate mortgage deals have climbed throughout this year, as the Bank of England put up interest rates to curb rising prices. 
But they shot up following then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's ill-fated mini-budget in September.
, and fell back slightly in the aftermath of his successor Jeremy Hunt's Autumn Statement.
Anyone taking out a new mortgage is still likely to pay a much higher rate than on their previous deal. 
Under the Lib Dem proposals, anyone who sees their mortgage payments rise by more than 10% of their household income would get a grant to cover the cost of that rise for the next year, up to a maximum of £300 a month.
rty is also calling for an increase in housing benefit - and for the government to pass much-delayed legislation to ban Section 21 no-fault evictions, where private landlords can evict tenants without giving a reason.
Sir Ed urged the government to pass legislation before the Christmas recess to enact the ban on no-fault evictions. 
A government spokesman said: ""We are protecting vulnerable families from homelessness this winter with an extra £50m to prevent evictions and secure new places for people to live.""
He said cost-of-living payments were also being provided to the most vulnerable households, in addition to support with energy bills. 
""Ensuring a fair deal for renters remains a priority for the government, that's why we will deliver on our commitment to abolish Section 21 'no-fault' evictions,"" he added."	/news/uk-politics-63957970
entertainment	Robbie Coltrane obituary: Actor who could be funny or serious, but always compelling	"Robbie Coltrane, who has died at the age of 72, became an international star as the giant Hagrid in the Harry Potter films.
But his reputation in the UK had already been sealed, notably as the chain-smoking forensic psychologist Fitz in Cracker - one of a number of compelling and larger-than-life characters he made his own.
He cut his teeth in stand-up comedy before branching out into films and television, comfortably fitting into both funny and dramatic roles.
And he later rebelled against his middle-class upbringing and fought a well-publicised battle with alcohol addiction.
He was born Anthony Robert McMillan in Rutherglen on the outskirts of Glasgow on 30 March 1950.
His parents were both Calvinists. His mother was a teacher, while his father, a doctor, also worked part-time as a police surgeon.
Coltrane later claimed that his father was so busy, he hardly spoke to his son until he was six. He died of lung cancer when Coltrane was still a teenager.
His mother introduced him to literature and music, and he recalled lying under the piano while she played.
He was sent to Glenalmond public school in Perthshire, sometimes dubbed the Scottish Eton, where he began to kick against authority.
""I didn't accept the hierarchy, basically,"" he later told the Guardian. ""You've crossed the quad and you've got your hands in your pockets. That's not very good, is it?
""But I'm very lucky because I was a big, strong boy. It's essentially survival of the fittest and I was one of the fittest, so I have no complaints.""
xperience later led him to call for the banning of all public schools, and fostered his love of left-wing causes, earning the nickname Red Robbie.
He was threatened with expulsion after hanging the prefect's gowns on the clock tower, but applied himself enough to gather a reasonable education, and his size gained him a place in the school's rugby XV.
When he left school, he enrolled at Glasgow Art School, where he was teased for the posh voice he had laboriously adopted at Glenalmond, so he quickly reverted back to his native Glaswegian accent.
He opted to study painting. Although he quickly realised he'd never excel, he persevered through to his graduation.
""It was a horrible feeling. The ideas were not there on the canvas at all.""
By then, he'd decided film was where he wanted to be. In 1973, his documentary, Young Mental Health, was voted film of the year by the Scottish Education Council.
He was a jazz aficionado and adopted the stage name Coltrane in tribute to John Coltrane, the renowned saxophonist.
He began mixing with actors in Glasgow, taking part-time jobs while appearing on the Edinburgh Fringe and with a number of small theatre groups.
re were small parts in films, including appearances in Flash Gordon and Lindsay Anderson's black comedy Britannia Hospital.
He also featured in the TV series The Comic Strip Presents, which launched the careers of a host of comedy stars including Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmondson and Jennifer Saunders.
Arguably his big break as a straight actor came when he was cast in the 1986 Neil Jordan film Mona Lisa alongside Bob Hoskins.
For the next few years, his career see-sawed between comedy and more serious roles. 
re was Tutti Frutti, in which he played the lead singer of The Majestics, a chaotic Scottish rock 'n' roll band, and a hilarious performance as Samuel Johnson in Blackadder.
He also played Falstaff in Kenneth Branagh's film version of Henry V.
But, off stage, things were getting out of hand. He was struggling with alcohol addiction, and his friends worried that he had developed a self-destructive streak.
""Booze is my undoing. I can drink a gallon of beer and not feel the least bit drunk,"" he said.
His long on-off relationship with artist Robin Paine, who he had met at art school, also ended at this time after she felt unable to cope with his lifestyle.
failure of two films, Nuns on the Run and The Pope Must Die, helped persuade him to turn away from comedy.
He did that in some style with Cracker, which first aired on ITV in 1993. The writer, Jimmy McGovern, had wanted actor Robert Lindsay for the role, but he was committed to other projects.
role of the criminal psychologist Dr Edward ""Fitz"" Fitzgerald could have been made for Coltrane. His character, like Coltrane, was addicted to alcohol, sarcastic, occasionally foul-mouthed and not a little manic.
ries was a huge hit and Coltrane's performance won him three consecutive Bafta Awards. 
His personal life was also beginning to achieve some stability. He met an 18-year-old student, Rhona Gemmel, and withdrew to a remote farmhouse near Loch Lomond, where they raised two children. The couple married in 1999.
""You can't live the life of an existential hero and be a good father,"" Coltrane remarked.
He also managed to get his drinking, which had contributed to his excessive weight, under control.
In 1995, he played Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky, the Russian Mafia boss in the James Bond film Goldeneye, reprising the role four years later in The World Is Not Enough.
When casting began for the first Harry Potter film in 2000, JK Rowling insisted that Coltrane be given the part of Hagrid, the genial but somewhat indiscreet giant.
""Robbie is just perfect for Hagrid because Hagrid is a very loveable character, quite likeable, quite comic,"" the author said. ""But he had to have - you really do have to sense - a certain toughness underneath, and I think Robbie does that perfectly.""
Coltrane was nominated for a Bafta for Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and went on to play the role throughout the rest of the films.

business	China Eastern plane crash likely intentional, US reports say	"Flight data indicates a China Eastern Airlines plane that crashed in March was intentionally put into a nose-dive, according to US media reports.
Investigators have so far not found any mechanical or technical faults with the jet, the reports say, citing a preliminary assessment by US officials.
Boeing 737-800 was flying between the southern Chinese cities of Kunming and Guangzhou when it crashed.
All 132 passengers and crew on board the plane died in the crash.
""The plane did what it was told to do by someone in the cockpit,"" according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story, citing a person familiar with US officials' preliminary assessment of the cause of the crash.
Data from one of the plane's ""black box"" flight recorders, which was recovered from the crash site, suggested that inputs to the controls pushed the plane into a near-vertical dive, the report said.
ABC News, citing US officials, also reported that the crash was believed to have been caused by an intentional act.
Investigators looking into the crash are examining whether it was due to intentional action on the flight deck, with no evidence found of a technical malfunction, according to Reuters, which cited two people briefed on the matter.
China Eastern Airlines previously said the three pilots on board were qualified and in good health. 
rline separately told the Wall Street Journal that there was no indication that any of the pilots was in financial trouble.
China Eastern Airlines did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.
Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), which is leading investigations into the crash, also did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. 
Last month, the CAAC said reports that the plane may have been crashed deliberately had ""gravely misled the public"" and ""interfered with accident investigation work"".
Investigators are still in the process of analysing flight data and the wreckage from the crash, Chinese state media outlet the Global Times reported on Wednesday.
It also said the CAAC will continue to ""carry out the accident investigation in a scientific, rigorous and orderly manner"". 
Chinese embassy in Washington, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and plane maker Boeing declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal's report, due to guidelines set out by the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization.
""Under the rules regarding crash investigations... only the investigating agency can comment on an open air accident investigation,"" a Boeing spokesperson told the BBC on Wednesday. The company previously said it was assisting investigations in China and communicating with the NTSB.
Chinese airlines generally have a good safety record - the last major accident took place 12 years ago.

sports	Leopardstown Christmas Festival: Saint Roi secures Novice Chase win for Willie Mullins	"Saint Roi came from last to first to win the Brand New Racing Post App Novice Chase on the opening day of the Leopardstown Christmas Festival.
JP McManus-owned seven-year-old finished ahead of Visionarian and 8-11 favourite Fil Dor. 
Saint Roi's win came after finishing second to Fil Dor on his chasing debut at Navan in November.
""I thought he ran very well against a horse that had already had a run in Navan,"" said trainer Willie Mullins.
""If he'd won, we'd be coming here anyway, so rather than running in another beginners' chase, I thought: Let him have a crack at a good prize.""
Fourth in the Irish Champion Hurdle, the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham and the Punchestown Champion Hurdle last season, 3-1 shot Saint Roi dominated the betting with Fil Dor. 
Visionarian gave a bold sight in front for much of the Grade One contest, with a couple of jumping mistakes late in the back straight putting Fil Dor on the back foot.
Mark Walsh bided his time on Saint Roi before challenging for the lead as they approached the final fence. 
Visionarian, a 25-1 outsider, tried to hold on but Saint Roi's class shone through as he finished two and a quarter lengths ahead. 
""He jumps well enough and he'd schooled very well in the meantime,"" Mullins added. 
""We decided to change the tactics. JP was wondering would he be better waited with and Mark agreed. He's a nice prospect for the rest of the season.
""He's not the biggest horse in the world but he jumps very efficiently. He's also a lot more sensible over a fence than a hurdle.
""He had a hurdle rating good enough to run in championship races but was probably not a champion hurdler himself."""	/sport/horse-racing/64096999
health	Ambulance service urges rethink before calling 999 over Christmas	"People are being urged to reconsider whether they need an ambulance, before calling 999 over Christmas.
week has seen calls to the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) up 25% on the same period in previous years. 
It is believed to be a result of recent bad weather, a rise in flue cases and limited resources from a Covid backlog.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said efforts were being made to address ambulance waiting times.
Health workers were providing help  over the phone or in their homes to help alleviate pressure on emergency departments.
Last week, one in 10 ambulances in Ayrshire and Arran waited over four hours outside an emergency department to hand over a patient. 
And the SAS recently apologised after a patient was airlifted to Glasgow Airport when no ambulance was available for a 300 yard transfer from the helipad at Crosshouse Hospital in East Ayrshire.
Chief executive of the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) Pauline Howie told BBC Scotland the service was ""extremely busy"".
""Demand over the last week has been up 25% on what we would normally expect, which is often a very, very busy time of year,"" she said. 
""We suspect that that is due to a combination of the bad weather, an increase in respiratory illnesses, and a backlog due to Covid. 
""We are trying our very best to do what we can to prioritise patients and focus our limited resources on those that have got the most time-critically unwell conditions.""
People are being asked to consider whether speaking to their GP, NHS 24 or a community pharmacist might be a better option for their condition.
Ms Howie said: ""We have also developed an integrated clinical hub here within the Scottish Ambulance Service.
""So if your condition isn't a time critical emergency, we might offer a consultation with one of our clinicians to try to find a pathway that's right for you at that time, which often is not going to the emergency department.""
She said a recruitment campaign had taken on more staff than ever before.
Ms Howie told BBC Scotland that SAS recruited 540 new ambulance workers last year and 488 this year.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said the service was working to improve turnaround times.
""We'll do everything we can to give people the best possible service, but of course we know that there's far too many people waiting too long for treatment and care,"" he said.
Mr Yousaf told BBC Scotland that the service was seeing a spike in respiratory viruses, with flu cases in particular.
""Given the pressures that's on the system, this is going to be the most challenging time,"" he added.
""That's going to have an impact on the staff and equally no doubt it will have an impact on the care that we're able to provide for patients."""	/news/uk-scotland-64065840
entertainment	AEW's Saraya: Ex-WWE star on her dream return to the ring	"""It felt fantastic - I never thought I'd be able to wrestle again."" 
Saraya-Jade Bevis - aka WWE's Paige - says retiring in 2018 due to a neck injury was ""one of the hardest things"".
But then, earlier this year, she shocked the world by appearing for rival promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW).
At first Saraya didn't appear as a competitor - but now, four and a half years later, the 30-year-old is back in the ring.
Recalling the day she was medically cleared, she told the BBC: ""I just burst into tears and was like this is one of the best days of my life.""
Her first match back was against Britt Baker - who she credits with helping her with her return - in November.
Saraya, who was born in Norwich, is one of professional wrestling's best-known talents, receiving awards recognising her contribution to its women's division.
With many happy to see her back, the reaction to Saraya's return was largely positive.
But there was also a stream of online negativity.
Compared to when male superstars Edge and Daniel Bryan returned after their career-threatening layoffs, Saraya feels there was a difference in reaction to her comeback.
""There was a lot more support for them than for me - whether they just didn't like me as a person or a wrestler.""
But she has a laid-back approach to the negative comments.
""If it's good, if it's bad, people are going to hate it either way, so I just have to be like: 'At least you're watching me'.""
Saraya says her family were the first ones she contacted when she was medically cleared. 
But she also spoke to fellow wrestler Sasha Banks, as her neck injury happened during a match against her.
""I felt really awful for Sasha. Even though I was the one that got the injury, it takes its toll on somebody mentally,"" she said.
""Wrestling isn't an easy sport. And we sign up to get hurt… but it really does mess you up to end someone's career like that.""
She says fans of both are ""very passionate"" and would go ""head-to-head for years"" even though the pair had no issues.
""We were just like we don't have this rivalry behind-the-scenes,"" she said.
""Wrestling is one big family, whether you've known someone for a day or for a decade.
""They're all there for you and they know how important it is.""

rtlist has been whittled down to Glasgow and Liverpool, with a final decision due ""within weeks"".
Leeds and Sheffield councils said they were both proud of the work put in on their Eurovision bids.
West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin said she was ""hugely disappointed"" Leeds was unsuccessful but wished Glasgow and Liverpool ""the best of luck"".
BBC said the two remaining cities, which have riverside arena venues, had ""the strongest overall offer"".
UK was chosen to host the contest after organisers decided it could not be staged by this year's winner, Ukraine, because of the ongoing war.
UK singer Sam Ryder finished second at this year's contest in Turin, Italy.
A hotly contested selection process saw 20 UK cities express an interest in hosting next year's show before that was narrowed down to seven, and now a final two.
Councillor Ben Miskell, Economic Development and Skills Policy Committee Deputy Chair for Sheffield City Council, said getting to the final seven showed the city had ""really meant business"".
""Loads of cities wanted to host this and it was amazing to see Sheffield and South Yorkshire get behind this bid,"" he said.
""Over the last few months we have showcased the very best of Sheffield - the love of music that runs through our veins, our stunning outdoor city, and of course our people.
""As the UK's first City of Sanctuary we have said all along we were doing this in solidarity with Ukraine and its people. 
""We have long-held and strong connections with Ukraine and they have been at the forefront of our minds throughout this bid.""
Mr Miskell said along with hosting the Women's Euros in the summer, it had some ""massive events"" coming up including the Rugby League World Cup.
Leeds City Council Leader Councillor James Lewis said the city ""did the best we could"" in its bid.
He said: ""I would like to thank our local Ukrainian community for all their support and help, and I would also like to say a massive thank you to everyone who has been involved in bringing the Leeds bid together from our own staff to all our key partners who worked so hard to bring it to life. ""

18-year-old has asked to be recognised as female and have the name Vivian Jenna Wilson.
She was known as Xavier Alexander Musk.
for both a name change and a new birth certificate was filed with the Los Angeles County Superior Court in Santa Monica.
Her request is set out in court documents filed in April, which have only recently come to light.
re was no further detail of the apparent rift between Mr Musk's daughter and her father.
SpaceX entrepreneur has yet to comment.
Mr Musk was married to Vivian's mother, Canadian author Justine Wilson, from 2000 until they divorced in 2008. 
r first son, Nevada, was born in 2002, and died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) at 10 weeks.

He has two other children,  X Æ A-Xii and Exa Dark Sideræl - who goes by Y - with singer Grimes, with whom he has had an on-off relationship. 
His children have kept a relatively low profile despite their father's fame.
On Father's Day, the entrepreneur tweeted that he loves all his children.

He has also said he is a fan of Ron DeSantis, the Republican Florida governor who introduced the so-called ""Don't Say Gay"" bill. This controversial piece of legislation restricts schools from teaching students about sexual orientation and gender issues, with teachers opening themselves up to lawsuits should they fail to comply.

sports	The Open: Adam Scott recalls Open Championship meltdown in 2012	"Adam Scott should have won The Open in 2012. He knows it and the thousands of fans at Royal Lytham and St Annes that week know it.
rs ago, the Australian led by four shots with four holes to play but bogeyed each one to lose by one to Ernie Els.
week's Radio 5 Live Sport podcast, building up to July's 150th Open, looks at the nearly men - players such as Scott, and France's Jean van de Velde, who famously blew a three-shot lead on the 18th at Carnoustie in 1999 and then lost a play-off.
Australian Scott says ""it hurts more today than it did at the time"". 
""There is no tournament I want to win more,"" he added. ""It felt closer to me than any of the American majors when I was young, so there was a strong connection there.""
He equalled the course record by shooting a six-under-par 64 in the opening round and maintained his form to take a four-shot lead into the final round.
And when he holed a birdie on the 14th hole, his lead was four and the coveted Claret Jug was in touching distance.
""I'm not one to get ahead of myself on the golf course in those situations,"" he said. ""Everything is going well when you're four in front with four to go but there are specific times in tournaments when you really need to up your intensity and up your focus.
""It might just be that one shot, or two shots, that are so crucial and I think I played those last four holes a little too casually.
""It was too comfortable, four-shot lead, of course it's lovely, but as you can see, it can evaporate. 
""I don't think I did anything really horrible in those four holes but I didn't make any of my par putts from inside 10 feet, apart from on the 17th hole, and to win a tournament you're going to have to make a putt somewhere.
""I've learned from that and it was very different then at the Masters eight months later.""
At the 2013 Masters, Scott beat Angel Cabrera in a play-off to become the first Australian winner of that major.
""It's funny how these things work out,"" Scott said. ""I'm always going to be the first Aussie to win the Masters and that's something that I'm incredibly proud of.""
Now 41, Scott is gearing up for the 150th Open at St Andrews and drawing on his previous good form at the Old Course.
""In 2015 I was tied for the lead with six to go and stumbled my way in,"" he said. 
""I know I can do it around there and it really would so make up for what happened in 2012
""I think [The Open] is the pinnacle of the game. Bobby Jones said it first and [Jack] Nicklaus backed it up. He said the greatest players win at St Andrews and I'm not going to put myself straight in that calibre but I would love to be in that discussion."""	/sport/golf/61746553

rtrait was commissioned by the Speaker's advisory committee on works of art.
It was painted by Northern Ireland artist Colin Davidson and was based on sketches he made of the founding member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) in 2016. 
rtrait was unveiled on Monday in Portcullis House.
Mr Hume was one of the highest-profile politicians in Northern Ireland and played a major role in the peace talks which led to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.
He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace alongside David Trimble, the then leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. 
Mr Hume died in Londonderry in 2020 at the age of 83. 
ker's advisory committee on works of art agreed to commission the portrait following a proposal from SDLP MP for Belfast South Claire Hanna.
Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, said he was ""delighted"" to accept the work intro the parliamentary art collection.
He described Mr Hume as ""one of the true giants of Northern Irish politics"".
""He was also one of the most important and impactful parliamentarians of his generation, and is greatly missed by colleagues and members, both here in Westminster and in Europe,"" he added.
Artist Colin Davidson began working on the portrait, entitled John Hume, in 2022.

technology	Ukraine round-up: Using drones in the war and new concern over nuclear power plant	"Watch: The BBC joins drone pilots under fire as they locate Russian targets
Kherson was the first major city in Ukraine to fall into the hands of Russian forces after the invasion began just under six months ago - but now, it's the one the Ukrainians have hopes of retaking.
Since last month, Ukraine and its allies have been saying the counter-offensive in the Kherson region is gaining momentum, with Maj Gen Dmytro Marchenko telling the BBC Ukrainian forces aim to recapture the city - strategically located to the west of the Dnipro river - within weeks. 
But if they do, it looks unlikely to be through a traditional full-scale attack: instead, small drone units could be playing a significant role.
BBC has met one of the drone pilots aiming to do just that - and he's using the call-sign Maverick, the name of Tom Cruise's character in the film Top Gun.
Antonio Guterres, United Nations secretary general, has been in the Ukrainian city of Lviv for talks with President Volodymyr Zelensky and Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
UN and Turkey brokered a landmark deal that earlier this month saw grain exports resume from Ukraine's ports for the first time in months.
f grain had been trapped because of Russian blockades, leading to shortages and higher food prices in other parts of the world. Before the war, Ukraine was one of the world's key agricultural producers.
Not surprisingly, the leaders discussed the scheme, with Mr Zelenksy later saying they would not only continue with the initiative, but also discussed ""the possible directions of its development"". 
Mr Guterres plans to visit the Black Sea port of Odesa - from where the grain shipments have resumed - on Friday.
ree leaders also discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, around which heavy shelling has been taking place for weeks. Ukraine and Russia have each been blaming each other.
- the largest in Europe - has been under the control of Russian forces since March, but has continued to function - although  some staff working there have told the BBC they are ""being kept at gunpoint"".. 
Russians have been urged to hand control back over fears of what could happen if fighting in the area continues.
Mr Zelensky has described the ongoing stand-off as ""Russia's nuclear blackmail"" and urged the UN to ensure the plant's security and liberation. ""This deliberate terror on the part of the aggressor can have global catastrophic consequences for the whole world,"" the president wrote on messaging service Telegram.
Mr Guterres, speaking on Thursday, said the plant should be demilitarised and re-established as ""purely civilian"". 
But those demands have already been rejected by Moscow. A spokesman for the Russian foreign ministry, Ivan Nechayev, described Guterres's proposal as unacceptable, claiming it would make the facility ""more vulnerable"".
""That is the very reason that the proposals are unacceptable,"" he said.
As deliberations continue over Zaporizhzhia's future, Ukraine is preparing for the worst.
BBC's James Waterhouse visited a supermarket car park close to the site of the power plant which had been transformed into a training ground.
""Emergency workers are dressed in yellow hazmat suits,"" our correspondent says. ""They are practising cleaning drills in the event of a radioactive contamination.
""They are watched by senior officials, who are keen to see how ready the region would be in the event of a worst-case scenario.""

technology	Bristol councillors vote for inquiry into social media checks	"Councillors want an independent inquiry after council staff monitored parents of children with special educational needs on social media.
Leaked documents showed Bristol City Council officers watched the accounts of parents for posts critical of the authority. 
A report published in September cleared the Labour-controlled council of wrongdoing.
But on Tuesday councillors voted for an independent inquiry to be launched.   
Labour insisted the initial investigation absolving the council had been ""genuine"". 
Several months' worth of tweets were collected by council staff to use as evidence that two parents running a charity receiving local government money had been ""campaigning"" against the council, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reported. 
rents were part of the Bristol Parent Carer Forum (BPCF), which advocated for better services for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). 
Officers collected and shared a dossier of critical social media posts, cross-referencing anonymous Twitter accounts with private Facebook wedding photos.
wo of the parents involved told councillors they felt ""humiliated"" by senior council staff. 
In July, council chiefs withdrew support for BPCF receiving government funding, but insisted the decision had nothing to do with the social media monitoring.    
Speaking at a council meeting on Tuesday evening, Conservative Councillor Geoff Gollop said: ""The administration appears not to have condemned these actions, and by not condemning them that means they appear to have condoned them.
""It doesn't matter to me whether this was systematic or random, it was wrong -  yet we employ people who actually think it was right. 
""Only an independent inquiry will tell us who was responsible for this.""
Asher Craig, cabinet member for education, said: ""I take issue with how this motion (for an independent inquiry) talks about the council's legal team - implying their investigation wasn't genuine. 
""There is a difference between not agreeing with the outcome of a report and questioning the integrity of those who wrote it.
""Any suggestion that this council was carrying out covert surveillance on parents is just ridiculous. But if councillors want to spend taxpayers' money on an external investigation, then that's fine."" 
w 39 councillors in favour of an inquiry, with 18 abstaining. Labour councillors chose not to vote.
Bristol mayor Marvin Rees asked for the inquiry to be independently chaired, and for the cost in both time and money to be published.  
""Take ownership of the consequences of the actions you take when you're looking for your next angle or position of attack,"" he told opposition councillors.
It's unclear when the inquiry will be set up or who will chair it. 
One option could be to get the Local Government Association, which represents councils, to help organise the investigation.

Online Safety Bill aims to lay down rules in law about how platforms should deal with harmful content. 
It had been in its final stages and was to be discussed in Parliament next week, but will now be paused until MPs return from their summer break.
A government source confirmed to the BBC that timetable pressures meant the bill is being rescheduled.
Shadow culture minister Alex Davies-Jones said the delay was ""an absolutely devastating blow and another example of the Tories prioritising their own ideals over people's safety online"". 
Campaigners seeking changes to the existing regulations expressed concern at the delay.

requires pornography websites to use age verification technology to stop children from accessing the material on their sites, and there will be a duty for the largest social media platforms and search engines to prevent fraudulent advertising.
A government source suggested parliamentary time had been reduced because of the demand from the Labour Party for a formal vote of no confidence in the government and the prime minister.
Labour, which wants the PM to leave office immediately, had put forward a motion to hold a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. Its attempt failed, although Boris Johnson has decided to give MPs a vote of no confidence in the government. 
government source said: ""Parliamentary time got cut because of Labour's pointless motion.
""It was either the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill or the second day of the Online Safety Bill report stage that got dropped to allow Labour to have time to play politics. 
""The Online Safety Bill lost out.""
Labour's Ms Davies-Jones rejected claims her party were to blame for the delay tweeting: ""Parliamentary timetabling is entirely in the government's gift"". 
Ruth Smeeth, CEO of campaign group Index on Censorship and former Labour MP, welcomed the bill's passage through Parliament being paused. 
She said: ""This is a fundamentally broken bill - the next prime minister needs a total rethink.
""It would give tech executives like Nick Clegg and Mark Zuckerberg massive amounts of control over what we all can say online, would make the UK the first democracy in the world to break encrypted messaging apps, and it would make people who have experienced abuse online less safe by forcing platforms to delete vital evidence.""

But Andy Burrows, from children's charity the NSPCC, said the bill was a ""crucial piece of legislation"". 
He said tech firms ""have allowed harm to fester rather than get their house in order"".
Mr Burrows added: ""Online regulation is therefore vital to force their hand and delivering this legislation should be a cornerstone of any government's duty to keep the most vulnerable in our society safe.""
Meanwhile, the delay triggered an exchange between the Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries and one of the contenders to be Tory leader - and prime minister - Kemi Badenoch. 
Mrs Badenoch tweeted that the bill was ""in no fit state to become law"" adding: ""If I'm elected prime minister I will ensure the bill doesn't overreach. We should not be legislating for hurt feelings.""
Ms Dorries, who has been overseeing the legislation, replied with a question: ""Which part of the bill legislates for hurt feelings, Kemi?""
A new prime minister is expected to be announced on 5 September.
first draft paper of this bill was introduced by former PM Theresa May back in 2019.
ree years have seen seemingly endless revisions and amendments and the Online Safety Bill continues to generate huge debate. Some say that in itself is an indication of how flawed it is. 
government says it is designed to make the internet a safer place, and to shield people, especially children, from harmful content. Punishments for tech firms who do not remove this material quickly enough or do enough to actively prevent it from appearing in the first place, include huge fines and even prison sentences for individual executives. 
In its current form the bill gives enormous powers to the regulator Ofcom, which has in response been busy recruiting an army of specialists - although critics argue that parts of the rules are hard to enforce or require tech tools that do not yet exist. 
For example, currently the most popular messaging platform, WhatsApp, uses end-to-end encryption - this means only the device which sends a message and the device which receives it can read it. 
firms themselves have no oversight of them and there is no backdoor for law enforcement. They can only be fully scanned for harmful content if there is a chink in this armour - which would also open the door for bad actors to exploit.
government itself has in the past taken advantage of the privacy provided by end-to-end encryption - back in March it was revealed that PM Boris Johnson was receiving sensitive data via WhatsApp."	/news/uk-62158287
business	Doing business on purpose	"wo most important days in your life are the day you're born, and the day you find out why.
So said Mark Twain, we're told, in an observation that could also be applied to business.
re's a growing movement towards the company being for a purpose - or more precisely, for a variety of purposes beyond the one that has dominated British business.
Making profit is why shareholders tend to subscribe on the day firms are born. And once listed on the London Stock Exchange, the pressure from institutional shareholders is to deliver consistent profit each quarter or a reliable prospect of future dividends.
're now being asked to consider whether it's in shareholders' long-term interest to aim for other objectives, including the social or environmental.
A jargon word has emerged - ""purpose"". Maybe I was late to it, but I first heard it from Alison Rose, chief executive of NatWest, including Royal Bank of Scotland, setting out her leadership mission to make it into a purpose-led bank.
I asked her in an interview last month what that meant. Her reply: ""Purpose-led means delivering long-term sustainable value for all our stakeholders - good returns for our shareholders, but also for our customers and for our communities and our colleagues. 
""It's about thinking long term and keeping all that in balance, and making sure we're addressing the role we play more broadly than just being a bank - around education, inclusion and the climate, and support for entrepreneurship.""
Ms Rose reflected: ""From my perspective, as someone who's been in banking a long time, there have been times we haven't balanced all those elements equally.""
who watched Royal Bank of Scotland going through the Fred Goodwin era and beyond surely cannot argue with that.
A commission was set up by the Scottish government with the Scottish Council for Development and Industry, that broad alliance of the public and private sector, to look into ""the purpose of business"" and how it might be altered for the public good.
r results are just in, published in a weighty, glossy report, along with the findings of polling and business surveys.
uggests that 50% of Scots think the reputation of business is excellent or good, while 5% disagree. The remainder are neutral or don't know.
's not a bad ratio when one considers the banking crisis or fury at energy suppliers that we've seen in recent years, or those of us holding on the phone while being fobbed off by an automated bot or told for more than two years how ""we're experiencing unusually high call volumes"". (I digress.)
Nearly two-thirds of Scots questioned for the survey said they would like to see business find profitable solutions to people's problems and those of the planet, while only 27% think that's what they already do.
Nearly half now see the maximising of profit is the current main purpose, and only 17% want to see things remain that way.
What about consumers? More people say they are influenced by a company's values and beliefs when they buy goods or choose where to work than say that are not.  So there may be a competitive advantage there for those who put some effort into this stuff.
A majority want firms to pay the real living wage, but there are only minorities who want firms to pay their fair share of tax (38%), provide job security for employees (32%) or commit clearly to good customer service (30%).
When the  Fraser of Allander Institute went to its panel of Scottish firms to find out what they think about it for this commission, it found most want to have a purpose beyond profit, but only by a small majority of 53%.
Many claimed they are already doing their bit, and the spur for that can be from different sources: a board member, employee or customer.
report gives us examples, from energy giant SSE to Jerba Campervans and from Muckle Media PR to Amiqus software.
Another stimulus is in trying to recruit the best people. Particularly in a hot labour market, and notably with younger workers, the right values and beliefs in the company boardroom, cascading into working life, can make all the difference to winning over recruits and retaining them.
f-interest extends to aligning with customers' values, and increasingly to investors in search of ethical places to plant their funds.
""A strong business purpose makes clear to customers why they should buy from you, to people why they should work for you and to society why it should trust you,"" says the report.
f the survey numbers is good, conclude this commission of people from business, professional services, academia and trade unions. But they also say the effort ought to be scaled up. 
So they have set out a vision for every Scottish business to become ""purposeful"" in delivering not just profit but for people and planet. And going beyond the usual dry analysis, they offer a checklist for company bosses, and also for investors to adopt, and for employees to play a leading role.
report has 12 suggestions for ways companies, trainers and different layers of government can play their part. Along with some change to company law to help this process, the other ideas tend towards the nebulous and vague.
Number five is to ""work with government to inform and mobilise consumer expectation of business purpose"".
By coincidence, this week, the UK government has ventured into this terrain with a suggestion that firms should demonstrate their efforts to cut prices amid the cost of living pressures. For doing so, they could get some kind of government kite-mark. The response has been at best polite explanation of how business works, and sometimes one of withering contempt.
Back in Scotland, the Purpose of Business Commission has set a firmer target of a tenth of Scottish firms, some 36,000, that can define, measure and manage their environmental, social and governance impact. 
's where it can get trickier. Measuring inputs and outcomes of these more abstract concepts is more difficult than bean-counting for the bottom line.
It is also where good intent comes into conflict with cynicism. There is already something known as ""purpose-washing"". It's the equivalent of green-washing: spray-painting your company's reputation green in the hope of gaining environmental credit.
In this line of business, authenticity counts for a lot."	/news/uk-scotland-61975166
entertainment	Kanye West Twitter ban: A timeline of the rapper's downfall	"Kanye West has never been afraid to upset people, but his recent tirades against Jewish people have been too much for many.
At the start of October, he was a billionaire music artist and businessman, and had deals with some of the world's biggest brands.
Fast-forward just two months, and most of those no longer apply.
And it all started with a T-shirt. 
At his Yeezy SZN 9 show, Kanye, now officially known as Ye, wears a t-shirt with a White Lives Matter slogan. 
Anti-racism campaigners call it out as hate speech mocking the Black Lives Matter movement. 
A picture of Kanye posing with conservative commentator Candace Owens, wearing a matching top, goes viral.  
It doesn't go down well, and fans and fellow hip-hop stars line up to call him out.
Kanye gets involved in a row with rapper Diddy, who posts a video criticising the White Lives Matter shirts.
In an Instagram post, Kanye appears to suggest Diddy is being controlled by Jews. Ye is criticised for antisemitism, and his account is suspended.
Adidas says it's reviewing its deal with Kanye.
Kanye - who hasn't posted on Twitter for almost two years - returns to the bird and takes aim at Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Facebook and Instagram. 
He then posts a tweet which appears to be a threat directed at Jewish people. 
witter follows Instagram's lead and kicks him off.
Website Vice obtains unaired footage from an interview with Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson.
It says these unused clips involve the rapper making various antisemitic claims and repeating myths about Jewish people. 
An episode of YouTube talk show The Shop: Uninterrupted starring Kanye is pulled over 'more hate speech' due to his alleged use of hate speech.
Kanye was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago and has publicly spoken about his challenges with his mental health.
But at the time of this interview being pulled, people who share his condition told the BBC that mental health problems do not go hand-in-hand with antisemitism.
A bad week for Kanye as major companies begin to announce they no longer want to work with him. 
Fashion house Balenciaga and talent scouts Creative Artists Agency follow JP Morgan bank and clothing shop Gap in ditching the artist. 
Adidas comes under increasing pressure to do the same. 
Adidas announces it's parting ways with Kanye.
Cutting the partnership means Adidas will make a net loss of £217m in 2022. 
But it's a bigger loss for Kanye, who is estimated to make $1.5bn from his contract with the sportswear giant. 
US money magazine Forbes says he is no longer a billionaire and puts his new net worth at $400m. 
American shoe company Skechers says Kanye turned up at its headquarters ""unannounced and uninvited"" and had to be removed. 
It says it has no plans to work with him and condemns his previous comments.
US magazine Rolling Stone publishes a lengthy article claiming West engaged in ""toxic"" behaviour against employees at Adidas. 
It declines to comment for the feature but two days later announces it's launched an investigation into the claims.
Kanye announces he plans to run for US president in 2024.
Before this, reports circulate of him dining at Donald Trump's Mar-A-Lago golf club in Florida with far-right political commentator Nick Fuentes.
Kanye appears on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones's Infowars. 
He wears a face covering through the whole interview, praises Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and rants about sin, pornography and the devil. 
Hours after the broadcast, he's suspended from Twitter again for ""violating our rule against incitement to violence"".
Kanye's known for being unpredictable, so it's unlikely to be the end of the saga. 
His music remains popular, and fans have been seeing him in their annual Spotify Wrapped and Apple Replay round-ups. 
But there are reports of some users demanding streaming giants remove his music. 
Fans have previously told Newsbeat they might consider skipping his tracks - so time will tell if he'll still be in our top tracks next year.

business	Eurozone raises interest rates for first time in 11 years	"European Central Bank (ECB) has raised interest rates for the first time in more than 11 years as it tries to control soaring eurozone inflation.
ECB increased its key interest rate by 0.5 percentage points to 0.0% and plans further hikes this year.
rate has been negative since 2014 in a bid to boost the region's economy after years of weak growth.
But consumer prices rose at a record 8.6% in the 12 months to June as food, fuel and energy costs soared.
well above the bank's 2% target.
It comes after the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve also put up their rates to try and rein in rising prices. 
Inflation is the pace at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs €1 and that rises by 5 cents compared with a year earlier, then milk inflation is 5%.
Ukraine war and Covid supply chain issues have driven up everyday costs across the world, putting pressure on households.
urozone is vulnerable because it relies heavily on Russia for its oil and gas. This week it urged member states to begin rationing supplies amid fears Moscow will halt gas deliveries this year, causing further price spikes.
Explaining its decision to raise rates, ECB president Christine Lagarde said: ""Economic activity [in the eurozone] is slowing. Russia's unjustified aggression towards Ukraine is an ongoing drag on growth.
""We expect inflation to remain undesirably high for some time owing to continued pressure from energy and food prices and pipeline pressures in the pricing chain,"" she added. 
k says further rate hikes ""will be appropriate"" and that it will take a ""meeting-by-meeting"" approach to raising rates.
However, there are concerns about how higher borrowing costs will affect highly indebted European nations, including Italy and Greece.
World Service senior presenter Victoria Craig
Optimism and worry. Two completely opposite emotions that have a tight grip on Greece's young adults.  
Many people who have lived half or nearly all of their lives in crisis mode say they are not optimistic about their futures in the country. 
Some have multiple jobs to make ends meet and pay their way through school.
While in previous years that might have barely got them by, the red-hot surge in food and energy prices - exacerbated by the war in Ukraine - has only made matters worse. 
usands have just given up trying. 
One estimate from the London School of Economics suggests roughly 400,000 degree holders have left Greece since 2010. A pattern described as brain drain - when highly-skilled workers are taking their expertise to other shores.
But not all hope is lost, and not all are pessimistic. 
ugh the youth unemployment rate came in above 36% in April - the highest in the eurozone, the rate is considerably lower than where it peaked in 2013 - at 58.2% - during the height of the Greek debt crisis. 
More broadly, the European Commission expects the country's economy will grow about 4% this year.
's likely to be helped by a boom in tourism - an industry that makes up about 25% of economic output - following two years of tough pandemic pain. 
's deputy finance minister, Theodore Skylakakis, told me that although it's hard for those who grew up in a crisis era to see it, progress is there. 
""When people have experienced this, especially young people, all their lives or their working lives, hardship, because they have lived since 2010, the biggest crisis ever.
""And then they had two years of the pandemic, huge crisis. And now they're seeing the energy crisis. So they're absolutely right to be worried,"" he said. 
""On the other hand, this time, instead of the previous years, we have jobs for them. The wages are increasing in Greece.
""And there are a lot of jobs available and a lot more going to become available. As the huge investments that I'm describing are actually happening. It's difficult for them to imagine what will happen after all these investments happen because people don't look into things like that. When they happen, they will just live through it.""
He also pointed to progress on structural economic reforms including reducing a still-high unemployment rate to 12.5% and increasing the cash cushion the country can use for a rainy day. 
Based on that, he said he's confident his country will avoid recession.
question remains: will young people stick around to see that through? 
making it more expensive to borrow money, people will spend less, bringing down demand and therefore prices. 
However, there are also concerns that higher rates could push the bloc into recession - which is defined as two successive quarters of economic decline. 
fears helped push the euro to a 20-year low against the dollar in recent weeks.
ECB began cutting interest rates after the 2008 financial crisis to stimulate growth, and took them as low as -0.5% during the pandemic.
was to encourage banks to lend rather than deposit money with the ECB.
Earlier this year the bank signalled it planned to increase rates again, although economists had only expected an increase of 0.25 percentage points in July.
Some economists have criticised the ECB for moving too slowly, pointing out that the UK and US began raising rates months ago. 
Carsten Brzeski, chief eurozone economist at ING bank, said: ""In hindsight, the very gradual and cautious normalisation process the ECB started at the end of last year has simply been too slow and too late."""	/news/business-62240730
entertainment	Madison Beer: Popstar on the downsides of social media fame	"Being a popstar nowadays comes with a lot of pressure. As well as recording albums and performing around the world, musicians have to deal with having a huge presence on social media.
American singer Madison Beer is no exception.
23-year-old has just over 32 million followers on Instagram and almost 18 million followers on TikTok.
And while social media is one of the reasons Madison found fame, the popstar tells Radio 1 Newsbeat she'd consider taking a break from the apps.
""Over the years my relationship with it has changed a lot. I just try to prioritise real life, my relationships and who I am in real life,"" she says, adding that she ""spends a lot less time"" on social media now.
""I use it, and I'm active on it, but I try not to let it dictate my life anymore.
""I just put a lot more of my focus into my music, who I am and what I stand for.""
ger shot to fame when Justin Bieber tweeted a video of a 13-year-old Madison covering Etta James' At Last.
But Madison says she found viral fame and the negative sides of social media tougher to deal with when she was a teenager.
""It was really, really hard for me when I was younger, and I didn't have such a strong sense of self,"" she says.
""People really dictated who I was, and obviously, that impacted me a lot - so it was hard.""
Asked if she'd take some time away from social media, Madison tells Newsbeat: ""I do I think that is in the potential near future.
""I've definitely developed like a healthy relationship [with social media] and I've been able to use it when I want to, but also be off it when I feel like I need to be.""
Reckless singer wouldn't be the first big name to take time away from socials.
kes of Ed Sheeran, Selena Gomez, Kanye West and Taylor Swift have all disappeared from social media for a while.
In 2020, Madison opened up about being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD).
According to the NHS, BPD is a disorder of mood and how a person interacts with others.
Madison - whose new single Dangerous was released this week - says it was ""intimidating"" to share her diagnosis at first, but that she's now ""grateful"" that she spoke up.
""I was really afraid to open up, because in the past anytime I've opened up to like social media or the public, it's always been made fun of,"" she says.
""But now it's become such a part of who I am, that I'm really grateful I pushed myself to open up in that way.
""I think that I have a story that's worthy of being told, and I have a lot of growth that I would love to share.""

technology	Guardian newspaper hit by suspected ransomware attack	"Guardian newspaper has come under a suspected ransomware attack.
It said there had been a ""serious incident"" affecting its IT systems in the last 24 hours, with disruption to ""behind the scenes services"".
mpany said it was continuing to publish globally to its website - one of the most visited news sites in the world - and was ""confident"" it could still print the physical paper.
Staff have been told not to go into the office and to work from home.
In a statement, the Guardian said: ""Our technology teams have been working to deal with all aspects of this incident, with the vast majority of our staff able to work from home as we did during the pandemic.
""We believe this to be a ransomware attack, but are continuing to consider all possibilities.""
Ransomware is malicious software used by hackers - and often sent via attachments in emails - to gain access to an organisation's or individual's computer systems.
riminals then find and encrypt important or sensitive files - and demand a ransom for them to be unlocked.
Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work?
A huge range of targets - from schools and hospitals to government agencies and media organisations - have fallen victim to ransomware, with research indicating hackers are paid in the majority of cases, especially in the UK.
According to the Press Gazette, the Guardian is the ninth most-read news site in the world, with almost 390 million visits in November.
In its own reporting of the incident, the Guardian said online publishing was ""largely unaffected"".
It said Guardian Media Group chief executive Anna Bateson and editor-in-chief Katharine Viner had sent a message to the company's workforce.
""Thank you to everyone working hard throughout this incident to keep us publishing,"" they said.
""We will continue to keep our staff and anyone else affected informed. 
""With a few key exceptions, we would like everyone to work from home for the remainder of the week unless we notify you otherwise.""
Jake Moore, global cyber-security adviser at security software company ESET, said the Guardian being targeted was not a surprise.
""News organisations have become a regular target for cyber-attacks this year, and these attacks often have even more damaging effects on the companies targeted,"" he said.
""Ransomware can often bring all departments to a standstill, so it is fortunate that despite this attack the organisation will still see some key areas working as usual."" "	/news/technology-64056300
business	What the Autumn Statement means for you and the cost of living	"With the cost of living rising at its fastest rate for 41 years, this is going to be a tough winter for many people.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has outlined plans designed to tackle rising prices and restore the UK's credibility with international markets.
It will mean further pain for many, but the chancellor argues that the most vulnerable in society are being protected. Here are some of the ways the Autumn Statement will affect you. 
You start to pay income tax on annual earnings of more than £12,570, charged at 20%. You then pay tax of 40% on earnings over £50,270 a year, although the bands are different in Scotland.
- or tax thresholds - had already been frozen until 2026, rather than going up in line with prices as you might normally expect. 
r has now extended that freeze for a further two years. That means any kind of pay rise could drag you into a higher tax bracket. Even if it does not, it will almost certainly mean a greater proportion of your income is taxed.
ghest rate of income tax - which is 45% currently on earnings above £150,000 - will be paid on earnings of more than £125,140 from April instead, the chancellor has announced. That means the highest paid could pay hundreds of pounds more a year in income tax.
Spring Statement of March and September's mini-budget both included plans to cut the basic rate of income tax. Unsurprisingly, there were no such promises this time.
reshold at which people start to pay inheritance tax will also be frozen, and the dividend allowance (the amount you can receive each year in dividends, if you own shares, before paying tax) will be cut from £2,000 to £1,000 next year and then to £500 from April 2024. The allowance stood at £5,000 as recently as 2018.
ual allowance before capital gains tax is paid will also be reduced from £12,300 to £6,000 in April and then to £3,000 a year later. This tax is paid when you sell an asset, such as company shares or a second home.
Strains over the cost of living have centred on rising prices. The rate at which prices rise is measured by inflation, currently at 11.1%, which means that a typical item that cost £100 a year ago will cost £111.10 today.
good news from the government's independent forecasters - the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - is that the inflation rate will drop to 7.4% next year. The target set for inflation is 2%.
However, a fall in the inflation rate does not mean that prices in the shops will be going down. It just means that they will be going up more slowly than now.
OBR said soaring inflation would still hit households' real disposable income - a measure of living standards - by the largest amount since official records began in 1956-57, falling by 4.3% in the year to April.
Even so, the OBR forecast that inflation may turn negative, in other words prices may fall by late 2024.
At present, there is a government cap on domestic energy bills, known as the Energy Price Guarantee. It limits the price per unit of energy used, not the total bill. It means that since October, the household using a typical amount of gas and electricity pays £2,500 a year.
was due to expire in April, leaving the prospect of the typical annual bill going up to £3,700, according to analysts at consultancy Cornwall Insight.
Mr Hunt said that this cap would be extended for a further 12 months, but would be less generous than now - so the typical household pays £3,000 a year. Mr Hunt predicted that would save the typical household £500 in a year.
government is also pumping more money into energy efficiency schemes.
A host of cost-of-living payments have been made during the latter half of this year, including a £400 discount off everyone's energy bills this winter. Others were directed at those on lower-incomes on benefits, the elderly, and people with disabilities.
While the universal payment will end, there will be more targeted support next year. That will amount to £900 to households on means-tested benefits, £300 to pensioner households, and £150 for those on disability benefits. 
using heating oil will receive a payment of £200 this winter, rather than £100 as previously planned.
Under the ""triple lock"", the state pension is supposed to increase each year in line with the highest of inflation (as measured by the Consumer Prices Index in September), the average increase in wages across the UK, or 2.5%.
After months of uncertainty, the chancellor confirmed that the state pension would go up by 10.1%, to match inflation.
will see the ""new"" state pension, currently worth £185.15 a week, go up to £203.85. The basic state pension, for those who reached state pension age before April 2016, is currently £141.85 a week, and will go up to £156.20. That can be topped up for those on low incomes with pension credit, which will also go up by 10.1%.
government's review on the age at which the state pension is received, currently 66 and going up to 67, will be published early next year.
Some disability benefits - such as the personal independence payment - must rise, by law, in line with inflation each year. That happens in April, based on the previous September's inflation figure - which this time is 10.1%.
However, rises in most means-tested benefits - most significantly universal credit, which is received by about six million people - and tax credits are a decision for ministers.
r said these too would go up by 10.1%, which he said would mean a family on universal credit would benefit next year by around £600.
Mr Hunt said the government will cap the increase in social rents in England at a maximum of 7% in 2023-24, rather than the 11% potential rise under previous rules.
minimum pay rate for those aged 23 and above - the National Living Wage - is £9.50 an hour. This will rise to £10.42 in April - a move that affects about two million people. It is employers who must shoulder this cost.
Ministers will have to scrutinise the recommendations for public sector pay rises, such as salary increases for teachers, nurses and the armed forces. Widespread, ongoing disputes are expected.
At present, councils in England must hold a referendum if they want to increase council tax by more than 3%, but the chancellor said he would raise this to 5%.
OBR said that could see the average Band D council tax bill rise by £250 a year by 2027-28.
In September, the government said a cut in stamp duty tax in England and Northern Ireland for some house buyers would be permanent.
rice at which stamp duty is paid was doubled from £125,000 to £250,000 (£425,000 for first time buyers) and discounted stamp duty for first-time buyers applied to properties up to £625,000, rather than £500,000.
r has now introduced a deadline, which will see these cuts reversed at the end of March 2025.
r has announced electric vehicles will no longer be exempt from Vehicle Excise Duty from April 2025.
Currently there are different rates depending on the type of vehicle but electric vehicles are exempt.
