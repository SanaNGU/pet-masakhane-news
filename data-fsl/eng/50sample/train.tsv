technology	NHS App to offer video consultations by 2024	"NHS App will soon be updated with features to help offer people in England more personalised care.
It is part of the government's plan for a digital revolution to speed up care and improve access while saving the health service time and money.
By March 2023, more users will receive messages from their GP and be able to see their medical records and manage hospital elective-care appointments. 
And by March 2024, the app should offer face-to-face video consultations. 
Some who have downloaded the app can already access some of these services.
government's ambition is for at least 75% of adults to be using it by March 2024. 
Currently, less than half - about 28 million - have it on their phone or tablet. 
government also wants 90% of NHS trusts to have electronic patient records in place or be processing them by December 2023 and for all social-care providers to adopt a digital social-care record.
And patients across the country should be able to complete their hospital pre-assessment checks from home by September 2024.
By March 2023, NHS App users will be able to:
Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We are embarking on a radical programme of modernisation that will make sure the NHS is set up to meet the challenges of 2048 - not 1948, when it was first established."" 
Sarah Sweeney, from the health and social care charity National Voices, said: ""We welcome the ambition to use technology as an enabler for joined up, personalised care. 
""We haven't yet realised the full power of digital tools to help achieve person-centred, inclusive and accessible care for people and we have lots more to discover. 
""We look forward to working with health and care leaders, health and care charities and people living with ill health and disability, to explore how digital tools can be used to make what matters to people matter in health and care."""	/news/health-61964047
health	Desperate NHS pays up to £2,500 for nursing shifts	"NHS bosses are increasingly paying premium rates for agency staff to plug holes in rotas, the BBC has found.
Spending in this area rose by 20% last year to hit £3bn in England.
For many shifts, bosses have been so short-staffed they have been willing to breach the government pay caps for these agency workers, most of whom are doctors and nurses.
Separate data supplied by Labour showed some NHS trusts had paid as much as £2,500 to fill shifts. 
Out of 60 responses from trusts, 10 reported the most expensive shift cost over £2,000, and for another 13 it was between £1,000-2,000.
BBC has also seen evidence of aggressive marketing by agencies - which take a cut of the shift pay. One boasted it is the ""best"" time to try it, because the fees that can be commanded are increasing.
Although paying out £2,500 for one nursing shift may not be the norm - it shows how much supply shortages can cost the NHS.
Saffron Cordery, interim chief executive of NHS Providers which represent trusts in England, said: ""Trust leaders consistently raise concerns about sky-high agency costs. 
""They're already facing enormous financial pressures with the impact of inflation and energy costs, and the government's failure to fully fund staff pay awards.
""They are doing all they can to minimise agency spend. But safety must always come first.""
government said the NHS faced some exceptional pressures last year, but it expected spending on agency staff to fall in the future.
BBC spoke to one cancer doctor who was offered work for £130 an hour - well above the cap for his role - and described the fees available as ""astonishing"" and a reflection of ""desperation by management"".
Dr James Barson qualified four years ago. But instead of taking the traditional junior doctor route, he now solely focuses on agency work in hospitals across Lincolnshire.
reason? Pay and the flexibility. He can earn more than twice what he would get paid if he was on the NHS payroll, without the need to commit to nights and weekends.
""Being a junior doctor is very difficult, very demanding. Being a locum I can work nine to five, Monday to Friday and take days off that are entirely my decision."" 
He says he would not consider taking a shift for less than the market rate of £50 to £60 an hour.
But he says there are downsides to agency work, including lack of holiday and sickness pay, as well as ""not always feeling a welcome part of the team"".
Agency pay rates are capped at 55% above what a normal employee would receive. 
But the BBC investigation found for nearly nine in 10 agency shifts for doctors and dentists, and four in 10 for nurses the caps were exceeded last year.
NHS bosses can only do this if there is a significant risk to patient safety.
rise in 2021-22 comes after the NHS had appeared to get on top of the use of agency work following a government crackdown in 2015-16 when the cap was introduced.
Ministers set the NHS the task of moving away from agency work, encouraging the use of NHS staff banks, where employees do overtime.
After six years, during which spending had been curbed, the £500m jump has caused concern.
BBC used a combination of Freedom of Information requests to individual NHS services, as well as analysing published data, to find out what was going on with agency spending, as well as using data obtained by Labour.
About six in 10 trusts provided information on their own levels of spending. It showed huge variation, with some services spending less than 1% of their staff budget on agency workers and others in excess of 11%.
Previously reported figures suggest spending also appears to be rising in other parts of the UK. In Scotland it has doubled in the past year, while in Wales it has risen by more than 40%. 
In Northern Ireland, it is four times higher than it was three years ago.
Colchester Hospital is just one of many services which is increasingly relying on agency workers.
Emergency department matron Andy Seale says it is a constant battle making sure there are enough staff available.
""Sometimes you can spend a couple of hours every day trying to sort rotas out.""
It is a picture that is repeated across the hospital and the other sites that are part of the East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Trust. 
Chief executive Nick Hulme says a combination of factors is playing a role, including the need to open extra wards to cope with rising demand, as well as staffing shortages. 
Some people are even leaving their jobs, only to return later as agency workers. 
He says while many agency workers do fantastic work on the wards, he would still prefer to be able to use his own staff. ""We know that's best for patient care, best for patient experience. Agency staff require more supervision and tasks such as handovers take longer."" 
He acknowledges it is not the best use of taxpayer money, but says he has no choice. ""Quality and safety of care is always going to be the priority,"" he adds.
Siva Anandaciva, chief analyst at the King's Fund think tank, said the NHS was caught in a ""vicious cycle"". 
He said a combination of staffing shortages, Covid sickness absences and rising demands was driving the increase in reliance on agency workers.
""I don't think what is happening is a surprise. There will always be some reliance on temporary staff, but you want to minimise it.""
And Labour's shadow health secretary Wes Streeting called it an ""infuriating"" use of money.
""Taxpayers are picking up the bill for the Conservatives' failure to train enough doctors and nurses.""
He said Labour would train the doctors and nurses the NHS needs by abolishing the non-dom tax status, where UK residents whose permanent home is elsewhere may not have to pay UK tax on foreign income.
A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said the past year had seen some exceptional workforce pressures, and a drive to get services back to normal following the pandemic.
But she said the expectation was that spending would be reduced by at least 10% this year.
""We have a clear policy to reduce agency spend through capping the hourly pay of agency and temporary staff, ensuring they are only hired through approved NHS agreements to ensure value for money, and prioritising NHS staff.""
She said the government was in the process of developing a workforce plan that would help ensure the health service had the staff it needed in the future.
Currently one in 10 NHS posts is vacant.

technology	Olly Stephens: Social media links to violence investigated	"Links between harmful social media content seen by children and serious violence have been underestimated, a report has found.
Criminal justice consultancy Crest Advisory has called for a safety rating system to limit children's access to social media content.
Its researchers worked with the parents of Olly Stephens who was murdered in Reading, Berkshire, last year. 
His father said he had been ""groomed, abused and murdered via social media"".
Olly's family have campaigned for stricter online laws to stop harmful content being shared after it transpired the attack on him was planned on 11 social media platforms.
A girl lured 13-year-old Olly out of his house, while the boys who murdered him waited in fields near his home to attack. Two boys, aged 14, were found guilty of his murder. 
report, entitled Fixing Neverland and funded by charity The Dawes Trust, found that young people are routinely exposed to videos of violent acts and adverts for weapons.
It said the technology sector and government organisations have had a ""collective blindspot"" about the relationship between social media and serious youth violence.
It concluded that social media can ""amplify"" conflict and ""accelerate"" its route towards violence. 
Olly's mother, Amanda Stephens, said the government should consider the report's findings for the stalled Online Safety Bill.
""Our children live in an online world that means danger is close, it's under your roof, it can attack them 24 hours a day, there is no respite from its harm.
""Social media companies must be held accountable for the safety of children using their apps,"" she said.
His father, Stuart Stephens, said: ""There's also an anger that these companies are getting away with it. They don't care.""
Key recommendations also included better education about social media as well as standardised age verification controls to make it much harder for children to view harmful material.
It called for a ""five star"" rating scale for social media platforms to indicate how safe they are for children, compiled by the communications watchdog, Ofcom.
Joe Caluori, Crest Advisory's head of research and policy, said children were spending increasing amounts of time in ""unregulated, unsupervised online spaces"".
""Our research shows that parents of primary school aged children are unprepared for the risks their children face online, including petty spats which are allowed to escalate quickly, resulting serious violence which causes life changing injuries and even death, as in the tragic case of Olly Stephens.""

politics	Thousands join London protest calling for general election	"usands of people have joined a ""Britain is Broken"" protest in central London.
A coalition of trade unions and community organisations are taking part in the demonstration, which was organised by the People's Assembly.
group has called for a general election, action on low pay and the repeal of ""anti-union"" employment laws.
Protesters marched from Embankment to Trafalgar Square, where a rally is being held with various speakers.
Metropolitan Police said: ""There are currently a number of different demonstrations across London this afternoon.
""Several protests groups as expected are present in Trafalgar Square, with stewards on the ground working with police.""
force previously said extra officers would be on the streets as it expected demonstrations by environmental campaign group Just Stop Oil.
Speaking at the rally, former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government would be ""forced to listen"" to protesters calling for improved pay and workers rights.
""Governments do eventually listen because of popular movements,"" he said.
""The people out here are very determined.""
Michelle Uden, from south-east London, took her seven-year-old twin boys to the demonstration and said she wanted a change in leadership after struggling with the cost of living.
34-year-old cares for her husband, who has epilepsy, she said: ""Enough is enough.
""If we don't stand up and fight we'll sit down and cry.""
Mrs Uden said she took her children to the protest as she wanted them to see ""democracy in action"".
Ramona McCartney, national organiser for the People's Assembly, said: ""The government is in a deep crisis and the third prime minister in a matter of months has been decided by a tiny elite.
""We want to make this the biggest demonstration possible to force them to a general election and in solidarity with every striking worker.""
Laura Pidcock, national secretary of the People's Assembly, said: ""We have to come together, as a movement, to organise on the streets and in our communities, and show that our voices will not be silenced and that we want fundamental changes to the way our country is run.""

sports	LIV Golf: 2023 series recruits to be finalised 'by new year', says president Atul Khosla	"LIV Golf is targeting up to four players from the world's top 15 as it looks to complete its line-up for the lucrative Saudi Arabian-funded tour's second season in 2023.
rcuit already boasts reigning Open champion Cameron Smith along with fellow major winners Phil Mickelson, Brooks Koepka and Dustin Johnson.
LIV president Atul Khosla expects to announce new players ""by the new year"".
""We are in the middle of discussions right now,""  he added.
A source told BBC Sport: ""Future recruits look very exciting, I've heard there could be two to four players from the world's top 15 will come over.""
48-player line-up for the 2023 LIV season, with 12 additional reserves, will compete over 14 tournaments starting next February.
""We are going to get it [player recruitment] done this year. We want the teams locked in by the new year. It will play itself out over the next couple of months,"" Khosla, who works alongside commissioner Greg Norman, said at the Team Championship here in Miami.
uggests a new year shift in golf's bitter narrative after 2022 was dominated by speculation, rancour and defections by some of the game's biggest names. 
Like this year, in 2023 fields will be split into 12 four-man line-ups who will compete in a team league. This team element runs alongside $20m (£17.2m) individual events, and is worth an additional $5m per tournament and culminates in a $50m finale.
ms will be set in place after a transfer window, allowing trading between line-ups along with promised newcomers.  
Insiders say these entities, including The Majesticks GC, which features Ryder Cup stars Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Henrik Stenson as well as Englishman Sam Horsfield, will be heavily commercialised.
""We are already sold out of certain team merchandise,"" Khosla claimed while speaking on Saturday at Donald Trump's Doral resort. 
""That shows there is a desire to purchase team gear. We have launched team social channels. 
""I understand the concept is new to golf but the inherent human nature of wanting to be associated with a team is not.""
model appears dependent on attracting more top players, but leading PGA Tour stars such as Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Jon Rahm as well as Tiger Woods have pledged loyalty to the established tours.
LIV is also hampered because its events do not receive world ranking points.  
It has formed a strategic alliance with the relatively minor Middle East-based Mena Tour to bolster its bid for official recognition from the world ranking body that includes PGA and DP World Tour representation on its board.
""We believe we deserve the points,"" said Khosla. ""Clearly, including with our alliance with the Mena Tour, we absolutely deserve the points. 
""We can't control who is on the board and who is conflicted there. It is obvious at this point there are individuals on the board who are conflicted.""
LIV's arrival in men's professional golf has prompted an acrimonious battle for the future of the game. While the establishment would argue otherwise, Khosla insists they are a non-confrontational addition to men's golf.
""I can't control it,"" he said. ""I'm not the one creating that narrative. I can just focus on what we can do; fan experience and player experience.""
LIV has yet to secure a major television deal in the United States or the UK. These appear vital to the ambitions of the fledgling tour. 
""With a global league, we are looking at rights across the board,"" Khosla said.
""On the US front, we are back and forth with a few different networks. Step one was to show them the product, which they clearly understand.""
LIV tournaments are currently shown on YouTube and the tour's own website platforms. ""We are now at the point where outlets have said time could be cleared,"" Khosla added.
""I feel good about where we are but we have work to do over the next couple of months. We think we are providing an incredible commercial product. 
""These are not six-month or one-year deals, if a TV network is getting behind this it's for multiple years.""
LIV is also involved in negotiations with international broadcasters with several of its players having taken part in talks with broadcasters from their own country. There was no indication that a deal is imminent with a British network.
""We have got to start commercialising the product,"" Khosla said. ""We have got to get on TV, we have to get corporate partners. These are milestones that we need to hit.""
In the tournament, Poulter's Majesticks were knocked out in Saturday's quarter finals by Koepka's Smash GC who won all three points in their match up. 
4 Aces, captained by Dustin Johnson also progressed to Sunday's stroke play showdown along with the Australian quartet Punch GC who went through despite Smith being beaten 2&1 by Sergio Garcia. 
Louis Oosthuizen took his South African Stingers team through to the final day by beating Bryson DeChambeau after the American found water at the fifth extra hole of their contest."	/sport/golf/63441853
technology	TikTok blamed by filmmaker for allowing abusive comments on video	"A video on TikTok about sexual consent has been swamped with comments from men accusing women of alleging assault.
Many of them mention Andrew Tate, the controversial influencer who has been banned from several platforms for his misogynist views.
wo-minute video, from an account with about 1,700 followers, has been viewed more than 1.2 million times.
Its creator Emmeline Hartley believes TikTok's algorithms are driving more hateful comments towards the film.
People using TikTok are served content based on a mixture of videos they have previously liked, and on which people like them have watched and commented.
kTok said misogyny was prohibited on the platform. 
""Our community guidelines specifically call it out as a hateful ideology and we are crystal clear that we do not want that content on our platform,"" said a spokesperson.
It added that it had removed more than 100 comments from Ms Hartley's video, which it said was a small proportion of the number that had been left. 
Ms Hartley said she had found it impossible to make direct contact with someone from the platform to get help.
""We don't have the capacity or the manpower to respond to all the comments,"" Ms Hartley said.
Her intention was to present a complicated but common scenario about sexual consent but she said she was concerned to see the film being used by some of those commenting as an example of women ""tricking"" men.
""I thought, 'what have I done? I've made a film that's helping rape culture'.""
She says she has seen other videos on TikTok that have been swamped with abusive comments where the creator is appealing for likes and positivity to help ""pull them back from the wrong side of TikTok"".
Ms Hartley's original video, Keep Breathing, was 18 minutes long and made in 2018, with funding from various local organisations in Derby and backed by the British Film Institute.
It is a fictional story featuring a couple arguing in a lift about a previous sexual encounter, interwoven with flashbacks to the evening it took place.
racters had both been drinking alcohol, they met in a nightclub, and there were misunderstandings about how they were going to get home and whether the man was going to stay with the woman. 
However, the clip she posted to TikTok in September featured only the pair's argument and not the contextual flashbacks. When Ms Hartley tried to add a separate video featuring those, they were repeatedly removed by TikTok on the grounds that they were explicit.
She has now been able to share the context, but says there are still many comments which are abusive towards women.
Although she considered removing the videos, Ms Hartley says she is content that she decided to share the post.
""I don't regret it, but I'm trying to navigate how to respond,"" she said.
""Some of the comments have been healthy, a couple of people have changed their minds while replying to each other. I think it's important, it needs to go out there.""
Social media consultant Matt Navarra said that TikTok's algorithm functions as a recommendation service, drawing both on the previous activity of the individual user and others like them, in order to serve up new content with which the person is also likely to engage. 
keeps them on the platform for longer and more frequently, which is good for advertisers and therefore also good for TikTok's advertising revenue.
""It means if this content has been seen, engaged with and liked by a group of users who are, for example, Andrew Tate fans, then it's likely to show that piece of content to even more people who are that sort of user,"" he said. ""It's self perpetuating.""
reator cannot stop this train once it is in motion, because they have no control over the algorithm itself and there are limited options for reporting issues, Mr Navarra added.
In July it was reported that Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, was going to make its algorithm more similar to TikTok's, rather than prioritising content from accounts that individuals were already following. "	/news/technology-63243423
business	Sudbury to lose only post office until replacement is found	"A town with a population of 20,000 people is set to lose its only post office.
Post Office said it would be closing its branch inside the WHSmith store in Sudbury, Suffolk, on 9 June, although it was looking for an alternative location.
People in the town have been told the nearest alternative service is at Great Cornard, just over a mile (1.6km) away.
Post Office said it was ""deeply sorry"" and was working on a solution.
wn councillor Sue Ayres said they were ""very disappointed"".
She said there was ""always a queue"" at the Sudbury Post Office and it was used by a ""lot of people"".
Conservative councillor said post offices in surrounding villages would not cope with the demand.
""We have post offices in Great Waldingfield and Long Melford - and there are long, long queues.
""They have to consider those who do not have transport or can't go on a bus, it's just taking total disregard for the elderly. I'm absolutely gutted,"" she said.
Chris Weston, from Westons Bakery in the town, said she expressed interest in taking over the service in January but said she never heard back. 
She said: ""I would've loved the post office and would still have it.""
Post Office said it had interest from an applicant who wanted to keep the post office in the current location but that had ""unfortunately not been possible"".
It said it was ""working hard to find an alternative premise in the area where a post office can operate"" and to find a temporary solution.

technology	Theranos scandal: Who is Elizabeth Holmes and why was she on trial?	"She was ""the world's youngest self-made female billionaire"", trumpeted Forbes magazine. The ""next Steve Jobs"", said Inc, another business magazine that put her on the cover.
In 2014, Elizabeth Holmes, then 30 years old, was on top of the world. A Stanford University drop-out, she had founded a company valued at $9bn (£6.5bn) for supposedly bringing about a revolution in diagnosing disease. 
With a few drops of blood, Theranos promised that its Edison test could detect conditions such as cancer and diabetes quickly without the hassle of needles. Bigwigs from Henry Kissinger to general James Mattis sat on the board.
But by 2015, the seams were coming apart, and within a year, Holmes was exposed as a fake. The technology she touted didn't work at all, and by 2018 the company she founded had collapsed. 
In January, she was convicted by a jury in California on four counts of fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.
jury found her not guilty on four other charges and failed to reach a verdict on three more. Holmes, who had pleaded not guilty to all charges, sought a new trial but those requests were denied. 
She was sentenced on Friday to 11 years and three months in prison. 
During the trial Holmes accused her ex-boyfriend and business partner, Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, of emotional and sexual abuse at the time of the alleged crimes, impairing her mental state.
Balwani, 56, who faced the same fraud charges, was convicted in July and is due to be sentenced next month. He had called the claims ""outrageous"". 
Despite being the subject of a book, HBO documentary, TV series and an upcoming film, it is still unclear why Holmes took such a gamble on technology she knew didn't work.
She was raised in a comfortably well-off family in Washington DC, and was a polite but withdrawn child, according to people who knew her.
Inventor and businessman Richard Fuisz, 81, speculated there must have been immense pressure on Holmes to succeed. His family lived next door to the Holmes family for years, but they fell out when Theranos sued him over a patent dispute in 2011 (it was later settled). 
Holmes's parents spent much of their careers as bureaucrats on Capitol Hill, but ""they were very interested in status"" and ""lived for connections"", he told the BBC. Her father's great-great-grandfather founded Fleischmann's Yeast, which changed America's bread industry, and the family was very conscious about its lineage, he said.  
At age nine, the young Elizabeth wrote a letter to her father declaring that what she ""really want[ed] out of life is to discover something new, something that mankind didn't know was possible to do"".
When she got to Stanford University in 2002 to study chemical engineering, she came up with an idea for a patch that could scan the wearer for infections and release antibiotics as needed.
At 18, she already displayed an intransigence that would apparently continue and drive the company she would found the following year. 
Phyllis Gardner, an expert in clinical pharmacology at Stanford, recalled discussing Holmes's skin-patch idea and telling her it ""wouldn't work"".
""She just stared through me,"" Dr Gardner told the BBC.  
""And she just seemed absolutely confident of her own brilliance. She wasn't interested in my expertise and it was upsetting.""
Months later Holmes dropped out of Stanford aged 19 and launched Theranos, this time coming up with an apparently revolutionary way of testing blood from a simple finger prick. 
Powerful people were enthralled and invested without seeing audited financial accounts. 
US Treasury Secretary George Schultz, media tycoon Rupert Murdoch and America's richest family, the Waltons, were among her backers. 
upport lent her credibility, as did her demeanour.
""I knew she'd had this brilliant idea and that she had managed to convince all these investors and scientists,"" said Dr Jeffrey Flier, the former dean of Harvard Medical School, who met her for lunch in 2015. 
""She was self-assured, but when I asked her several questions about her technology she didn't look like she understood,"" added Dr Flier, who never formally assessed her technology. ""It seemed a bit odd, but I didn't come away thinking it was a fraud.""
Dr Flier ended up inviting her to join the medical school's Board of Fellows, which he regrets, although she was removed when the scandal broke. 
It began to unravel in 2015 when a whistleblower raised concerns about Theranos' flagship testing device, the Edison. The Wall Street Journal wrote a series of damning exposes claiming the results were unreliable and that the firm had been using commercially available machines made by other manufacturers for most of its testing. 
Lawsuits piled up, partners cut ties and in 2016 US regulators banned Holmes from operating a blood-testing service for two years. 
In 2018 Theranos was dissolved.
In March that year, Holmes settled civil charges from financial regulators that she had fraudulently raised $700m from investors. 
But three months later she was arrested, along with Mr Balwani, on criminal charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
Prosecutors said she knowingly misled patients about the tests and vastly exaggerated the firm's performance to financial backers.
As the Theranos scandal reached trial, commentators said it was remarkable how tightly Holmes clung to her original story, and people who knew her said they doubt she has changed. 
Since the trial, Holmes has been living in California with partner William ""Billy"" Evans, 27, an heir to the Evans Hotel Group. They had a son in July 2021 and she is pregnant with their second child.
Holmes's attorneys had said she should not face prison time on the grounds that she was not a danger to society. They offered testimony from more than 130 people on her behalf, including Senator Cory Booker.
But prosecutors argued that she was ""blinded"" by ambition, which put ""and will continue to put people in harm's way"". 
""She accepts no responsibility,"" they wrote in court filings. ""Quite the opposite, she insists she is the victim."""	/news/business-58336998
entertainment	Strictly's Hamza Yassin: Scots have accepted me as one of theirs	"He is normally knee-deep in grass, wading through mud or following animals in the wild.
But Sudan-born wildlife photographer Hamza Yassin is currently on the other side of the camera being watched by millions with partner Jowita Przystal on Strictly Come Dancing.
While the nation warms to his new talent, a tiny community hall in a remote Scottish village has become the hot ticket to watch him on a Saturday night.
32-year-old's friends and neighbours in the Highland village of Kilchoan are getting right behind him.
Hamza has lived in Kilchoan, on the peninsula of Ardnamurchan beside the Sound of Mull in Lochaber, for the past 11 years. 
He told BBC Scotland it is where he learned his trade.
""I cut my teeth as a wildlife cameraman in Scotland,"" he said.
""I had the love of the wildlife from my African background. Growing up I always loved animals and wanted to work with them.
""But where I actually started getting proper work, and learning about the animals and actually getting close to them to be able to take the images that I did, was all in Scotland.""
He added: ""It's got so much habitat for wildlife. For me, Scotland is home, it's accepted me as one of theirs and I absolutely love it. The west coast is close to my heart.""
Hamza moved to the UK when he was eight, and later gained a master's degree in Biological Imaging and Photography, and a bachelor's degree in Zoology with Conservation. He went on to become a published wildlife photographer and a tour guide, and is also a skilled ornithologist.
In July this year, Hamza received a Master Honours Degree from Bangor University, which one of his idols, Sir David Attenborough, has also received in the past.
He has worked on The One Show as one of their wildlife cameraman, leading him to land his own CBeebies show and Let's Go For A Walk companion book. 
He also appears on Countryfile and ITV's This Morning, and has filmed and presented Channel 4 shows Scotland: My Life in the Wild and Scotland: Escape to the Wilderness.
His neighbours in Kilchoan claim credit for bringing out his inner dancer by getting him involved in village ceilidhs.
Hamza said: ""I love dancing anyway but I didn't know how to do it.  Three times a year we have ceilidhs for occasions and that's where the people in the village taught me how to dance. I love it.""
He may not be able to incorporate his Scottish country dancing into his Strictly routines, but he wants to include his Scottish culture.

Jowita and Hamza blew the judges away with their salsa in week four and last week came joint top of the leaderboard.
And now friends and neighbours in Ardnamurchan are daring to dream about welcoming a champion home to the Highlands.
Cafe owner Olivia told the BBC: ""We are so proud of him. He is doing so well and doing a great job flying the flag for Scotland.
""The whole community is getting behind him and enjoying it. Every Saturday night we go to our little community hall, set up the projector, everyone comes along with home baking, drinks, and we just have a chat and a laugh and watch how he gets on."" 
Hamza's neighbour Gail said: ""We are averaging 50-60 people every Saturday night in the hall - almost half the village population. It's lovely getting together on the cold winter nights and cheering him on.""
She is happy the country is getting to see the friend they all love.
""He is such a nice guy and that is coming across. You can see how humble he is and that is how he is in real life. And he is drawing attention to what he cares about the most - the wildlife, conservation and the natural history.
""And that's a big thing here - we are in one of the most remote parts of Scotland with the most amazing wildlife and that's what brought him here in the first place.""
Gail added: ""He is a fantastic neighbour and I really miss him because he is someone I call upon a lot for rescuing me from a big spider or a dead mouse or helping me lift heavy things.""
Hamza admits  helping out with moving things inspired his lifts on the dancefloor.
""They call me the walking forklift in the village. I love helping people - especially if it's heavy. But never usually with humans. I don't normally go around lifting people.""
Hamza and Jowita say they are taking the competition a week - and a dance - at a time. 
And although Kilchoan is missing its famous resident. they don't want to see him too soon.

business	Energy crisis: UK expands gas emergency exercise ahead of winter	"A regular energy industry exercise aimed at preparing the UK for the possibility of a gas supply emergency has been scaled up despite the government downplaying the threat of shortages this winter.
ual drill will see potential scenarios - including rationing electricity - simulated over four days, rather than the usual two, as energy concerns grow.
Industry insiders linked the drill's extension to the seriousness of the energy challenges forecast this winter.
But the government says the exercise is a routine part of the energy industry calendar and insists there is no risk to gas supplies this winter.
National Grid exercise, which will take place across four days in September and October, will involve government agencies, regulators, lobby groups and major energy firms.
Called Exercise Degree, it will simulate scenarios in which a loss of gas supply triggers an emergency situation for the UK's energy system.
A global squeeze on the supply of gas since late last year has destabilised the global economy, increased living costs, and sent household energy bills skyrocketing.
Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng does not appear to have sought any advice from government officials on the possibility of rationing energy - a BBC Freedom of Information request found he had not done so before the end of June.
Energy experts have expressed surprise, particularly as other countries are working on such plans.
Government sources said this was because the UK had one of the most ""reliable and diverse energy systems in the world"" thanks to its investment in renewables, nuclear and the North Sea oil and gas industry.
Downing Street has insisted households and businesses will not face blackouts this winter, telling them not to feel they should cut down on energy use.
Electricity Supply Emergency Code describes the steps Mr Kwarteng could take to ration electricity, should that become necessary.
One course of action includes ""rota disconnections"", which involves limiting or cutting power to some customers on a rotational basis to reduce demand.
Keith Bell, professor of electronic and electrical engineering at Strathclyde University, said cutting some gas supplies to large industrial users was a ""credible scenario that we need to be ready for"".
""Codes defining what should happen in the event of gas or electricity shortages and who is responsible for what - including the role of the secretary of state - have existed for many years but haven't had to be used,"" he added.
""A lesson from the pandemic is the need for preparedness and to test emergency arrangements to be sure that they're fit for purpose.""
He identified the UK's dependence on gas imports from abroad and the lack of storage capacity as two major supply risks heading into winter.
Last year, almost 40% of the UK's electricity was generated by burning gas, while 38% of overall energy supply was imported from abroad.
Charles McAllister, director of policy for lobby group UK Onshore Oil and Gas, said the UK was ""at the highest risk of loss of energy supply in decades"".
He said the annual energy exercise would assess the extent to which demand can be reduced, especially from heavy industry, to mitigate supply risk.
wo industry sources said the difficult energy situation globally and how seriously preparations for that were being taken were factors in the exercise's expansion to four days.
One scenario explored during last year's two-day exercise involved ""turning off major users"" of gas in response to a pumping station issue, a source said.
Meanwhile, some major economies such as Germany and France have made plans for energy rationing should Russia - a major supplier of gas to Europe - turn off the taps this winter.
Energy prices have risen sharply because demand for gas has increased markedly since Covid-19 restrictions ended and the war in Ukraine disrupted supplies from Russia.
Serious rationing of energy possible this winter, says head of the International Agency Head
A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the UK had ""one of the most reliable and diverse energy systems in the world"".
Unlike much of the rest of Europe, the spokesperson added, ""we are not dependent on Russian energy imports meaning households, businesses and industry can be confident they will get the electricity and gas they need"".
But Labour's shadow net zero and climate secretary, Ed Miliband, said the Conservative government's policies had ""left bills too high and our energy security too weak"".
""Their short-sightedness has been staggering - from closing our gas storage facilities, to failing to insulate houses and cut bills, and blocking the quickest, cheapest and cleanest renewables in their energy strategy,"" the former Labour leader said."	/news/uk-politics-62604653
technology	Instagram-worthy Christmas: Parents reject social media pressure	"""Mammy, can we have an Elf on the Shelf?""
readed words were uttered by my darling six-year-old as he opened the first door of his obligatory chocolate advent calendar. 
f was duly installed on top of his Christmas stocking where it has remained ever since, next to a pile of yet-to-be-written Christmas cards. 
From Elf on the Shelf and North Pole breakfasts to Christmas Eve boxes and matching Christmas pyjamas - are social media-driven traditions spoiling Christmas? 
Charlotte Harding is the writer of family-focussed blog Witchy Wales, which covers everything from frugal living, recipes, book reviews and family-friendly activities.
""I definitely believe that these Insta-worthy fads going on at the moment are taking the fun out of Christmas, it's taking the fun out of these family events,"" said Charlotte, who has two boys aged 10 and eight.
""For me it's about being with your family at Christmas and it's about making memories that last.""
Charlotte, from Ferndale, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said her least favourite new tradition was Elf on the Shelf.  
""I wish I'd never introduced that thing into my life,"" she said. 
festive toy began as a character in a 2005 children's book, which tells how Santa sends an elf to check whether children are being naughty or nice.
From 1 December, once children are asleep, parents move the elf in different locations in the house so the children find him somewhere new when they wake up in the morning.
""I go to bed at night and I just think of that little cherub face waiting downstairs, and I think 'oh no, I've got to move it again' when I'm all warm tucked up in bed.""
She is also not a fan of the Christmas Eve box, which usually contains hot chocolate, marshmallows and pyjamas.
""You could spend about £50 on that if you really want to go all out,"" she said. 
r she went with her family to the winter light trail at Cardiff's Bute Park.
""I realised pretty quickly that people were buying tickets just for the photo opportunity,"" she said.
""They were lots of people holding up queues because they were there taking the perfect photo.""
She said it was made all the worse by the cost of living crisis and low level anxiety over trying to do everything with the children over the Christmas period was a topic of conversation at the school gates.  
""Where people are just trying to make out that things are perfect and shiny and bright for Christmas, it's put in a hell of a pressure on parents who just can't do it and who simply can't afford it,"" she said. 
""I just wish that people would wake up and see that the little things in life are the most beautiful.""
Christy Bruckner from Cardiff, who blogs as Welsh Mum of One, said the pressure to post the perfect picture meant she had not posted on Instagram in years. 
""A few years of being a parenting blogger made me realise how unimportant other people's opinions are and how terribly toxic social media can be,"" she said.
""I wouldn't do Elf on the Shelf even if I was being paid a juicy campaign fee,"" she said. 
""The pressure to perform on Instagram is insane. People are constantly comparing likes and comments and the interactions I experienced there are often forced - people like and comment not because they want a genuine engagement, but because they want you to do the same in return."" 
She said there was ""constant competition"" with other influencers. 
""I began to realise my online circles of 'friendship' weren't authentic and my connections felt forced,"" she said.
She said the final straw was receiving negative comments about her son's appearance. 
""Social media has had a huge negative effect on my mental health and I don't think I'm the only one. Because of that I no longer work on any campaigns that require Instagram use,"" she said. 
She said for her family she aimed to recreate ""the love and comfort and care"" she received from her mother and grandmother growing up, ""not trying to keep up with complete strangers"". 
But it is not always easy: ""It's incredibly hard when you see everyone else posting photos and talking about amazing experiences. There's always an element of Fomo [fear of missing out] and I think a lot of mums feel a lot of guilt about not giving their kids the same thing that other people do,"" she said.  
""I know I constantly question whether I'm a good mum."" 
Christy thinks social media sets an ""unrealistic standard of happiness"" but simple activities such as a family walk, baking a cake together or watching a film together could be just as rewarding and memorable.
Conversations about Christmas start on online network Mumsnet in the summer, said its head of communications and public affairs Rhiannon Evans.  
""If you're a parent of young children, there is a lot of pressure on you to pick up every tradition going and make Christmas as magical as possible -  it's something we know a lot of our users feel very stressed out about,"" she said. 
""Social media is quite a big part of it because if you see other families doing all those lovely photogenic activities you feel like it's something that you should participate in.""
She said a popular trend on the site this year was the North Pole breakfast, a special breakfast for children to mark the first door being opened of the advent calendar.
She said for many Christmas was an ""already expensive and stressful time of year"" and the newer traditions of social media were ""adding another layer of pressure for parents to do things that they can't necessarily afford"".
Mumsnet carried out a survey of 1,028 users between 21 October and 3 and October 2022 and 15% said they had taken on debt to pay for essentials in the past month. A third said they were very or extremely worried about their finances.
Rhiannon said: ""Just try not to feel the pressure and remember that the pictures you see on social media are not necessarily an accurate representation of any situation, they're a snapshot of a particular moment in time, and it's about doing what's best for you and for your family."""	/news/uk-wales-63950008
health	Sheffield families tell of fears over mould and damp health threat	"Residents in Sheffield council accommodation say damp and mould are having a worrying effect on their children's health.
One mother of three said damp had been so severe it made her children struggle to breathe.
It comes as figures show there are more than 1,000 mould cases requiring treatment in Sheffield council housing.
Sheffield City Council said it was concerned for the family's health and had contacted them to arrange repairs.
BBC spoke to families a month after a coroner concluded Rochdale toddler Awaab Ishak died of a respiratory condition caused by mould and the family's housing association did nothing to solve the issue.
Halimo Abdi, who lives on Verdon Street, said her children regularly missed school because of illness caused by the damp conditions. ""I was worried their lungs would just stop,"" she said.
A letter sent to Sheffield City Council from a consultant in paediatric respiratory medicine in November 2021 recommended the damp problem should be solved, or the family should be moved out of the property.
Ms Abdi said she had complained to the council ""more than a million times"", but the council ""had done nothing"".
Meanwhile Bashir Mohamed Hirsi, a Somalian refugee whose family of six live on Margate Drive, said he had tried to complain about water dripping from a bedroom ceiling.
""The council don't give me an interpreter, even when I ask sometimes they ignore me,"" he said.
""They say to me they will come, but don't come,"" he added. Mr Hirsi said as a result of the wet conditions his whole family now slept in one room.
Sheffield City Council said Mr Hirsi had not reported any ""outstanding repairs"". The council also said it had tried to contact Ms Abdi ""over a number of months"" and would arrange ""urgent"" visits to both homes.
uncil currently has 286 outstanding damp and mould cases in its properties, with 1,112 mould cases requiring halophane treatment to kill the roots of mould, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
Official figures showed there were 14,038 logged repairs, of which 6,193 were overdue, the service said.
Sheffield City Council had also set up a damp and mould task group to review and tackle cases across social and private housing, it added.

business	Oil giant Shell appoints renewables head as boss	"Shell is to replace its current boss Ben van Beurden with its head of gas and renewables, the oil giant has said. 
Mr van Beurden will to step down at the end of 2022, and be replaced by Wael Sawan.
Mr Sawan, a duel Lebanese-Canadian national who previously led Shell's oil and gas production business, was seen as a favourite to take the top job.
He now oversees Shell's growth into low carbon energies as well as its giant gas business.
Mr Sawan said he would ""grasp the opportunities presented by the energy transition"".
""We will be disciplined and value focused as we work with our customers and partners to deliver the reliable, affordable and cleaner energy the world needs,"" he said. 
Shell's chairman, Sir Andrew Mackenzie, said Mr van Beurden had ""been in the vanguard for the transition of Shell to a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 and has become a leading industry voice on some of the most important issues affecting society"".
Mr van Beurden was in charge when Shell bought gas giant BG Group for £36bn in 2015, and when the firm moved its headquarters to London earlier this year.
He also oversaw Shell's commitment to reduce oil production and cut emissions by 2050.
Ben van Beurden spent his entire career at Shell and was chief executive for the last nine years.
His lasting legacy will be the acquisition of gas giant BG group for $52bn (£36bn) in 2015.
urbocharged Shell's gas and LNG business just before many nations decided that gas would be their transition fuel between coal and greener alternatives, creating bumper profits for the group that delighted shareholders and scandalised activists and some politicians.
Mr van Beurden also set the oil giant on its transformation from an oil and gas company to an energy company, with a long-term focus on becoming a carbon neutral company by 2050.
But he was always very clear that the money to fund this transition would come from a hydrocarbons business that the world economy would need for decades to come.
A couple of years ago this position had some shareholders fearing he was off-message, and behind the zeitgeist, but the current crisis and the international scramble for gas to replace Russian supplies left him looking right and the company in a very strong position.
Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Mr Sawan's appointment was a ""clear marker"" that the company intends to change its ""somewhat vague, though grand sounding"" renewables strategy.
""Change won't happen overnight, but it's reasonable to think that at least tweaks to the existing renewable strategy could be on the cards,"" she said.
ublic is ""very sensitive surrounding allegations of profiteering and environmental damage"" at the moment, she said, but for investors dividends would take precedence over renewables strategy.
Under Mr van Beurden the oil giant has been criticised for its environmental record.
Last year, a court in the Netherlands ruled that Shell had to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions, saying that by 2030 they must be cut by 45% compared to 2019 levels.
Friends of the Earth, one of the environmental groups that brought the case, said: ""Shell is causing dangerous climate change and must now stop it quickly.""
Shell filed its appeal against the ruling in March this year, with Mr van Beurden previously saying that Shell should not be responsible for reducing its customers' emissions.
In May this year, safety consultant Caroline Dennett stopped working for Shell, saying she could ""no longer work for a company that ignores all the alarms and dismisses the risks of climate change and ecological collapse"".
She added that Shell was ""not winding down on oil and gas, but planning to explore and extract much more"".

technology	Twitter in data-protection probe after '400 million' user details up for sale	"A watchdog is to investigate Twitter after a hacker claimed to have private details linked to more than 400 million accounts.
ker, ""Ryushi"", is demanding $200,000 (£166,000) to hand over the data - reported to include that of some celebrities - and delete it.
Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) says it ""will examine Twitter's compliance with data-protection law in relation to that security issue"".
witter has not commented on the claim.
ude phone numbers and emails, including those belonging to celebrities and politicians, but the purported size of the haul is not confirmed. Only a small ""sample"" has so far been made public.
Guardian reported that data of US Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was included in the sample of data published by the hacker. The data of broadcaster Piers Morgan, who recently had his Twitter account hacked, is also reported to be included.
witter has so far not responded to press inquiries about the claimed breach.  
Chief executive Elon Musk did not reply to a tweeted request for comment from leading cyber-security reporter Brian Krebs - though the breach, as Mr Krebs notes, probably occurred before the Tesla boss took over.
Cyber-crime intelligence company Hudson Rock says it was the first to raise the alarm about the data sale. 
While acknowledging the amount of data taken had not been verified, the firm's chief technology officer, Alon Gal, told the BBC a number of clues appeared to support the hacker's claim.
r to have been copied from an earlier breach in which details were published from 5.4 million Twitter accounts, Mr Gal said.
Only 60 emails out of the sample of 1,000 provided by the hacker in the earlier incident appeared, ""so we are confident that this breach is different and significantly bigger"", he said.
Also, Mr Gal noted: ""The hacker aims to sell the database through an escrow service that is offered on a cyber-crime forum. Typically this is only done for real offerings.""
An escrow service is a third party that agrees to release funds only when certain conditions (such as handing over data) are met.
""Ryushi"" has said that it exploited a problem with a system that lets computer programmes connect with Twitter to compile the data.
witter fixed the weakness in the system in 2022. But the flaw is also believed to have been used in the earlier breach affecting more than five million accounts.
DPC announced it was investigating that earlier breach on 23 December.
As Twitter's European headquarters are based in Dublin, the commission is the lead authority supervising its compliance with EU data-protection rules.
In a statement sent to the BBC about the latest incident, the DPC noted its continuing investigation into the earlier Twitter breach but added: ""Reports have claimed that some additional datasets have now been offered for sale on the dark web.
""The DPC has engaged with Twitter in this inquiry and will examine Twitter's compliance with data-protection law in relation to that security issue.""
ker is aware of how damaging the loss of data can be for platforms.
In the online post offering to sell the data, it warns Twitter that its best chance of avoiding a large data-protection fine is to buy back the data ""exclusively"".
In November, Meta was hit with a 265m-euro ($276m) fine by the DPC after data scraped from more than 533 million Facebook users was leaked online.
UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) told the BBC that it was aware of ""media reports"" regarding Twitter user's personal information being made available on the internet. 
""We are engaged in dialogue with Twitter's data protection officer and will be making enquiries on this matter,"" it said.

""The vote provides UIPM with a mandate to propose a new-look modern pentathlon including obstacle discipline to the IOC for potential inclusion in the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games,"" a UIPM statement said.
Modern pentathlon is currently made up of fencing, swimming, show jumping and a combined running and shooting event.
Show jumping was removed by the UIPM after a German coach was seen striking a horse at the Tokyo Olympics.
Britain's Olympic champion Joe Choong has said he will quit modern pentathlon if show jumping is replaced with obstacle course racing.
Athletes from USA Pentathlon have also opposed the proposed changes.
Show jumping will remain one of the five events for the 2024 Olympics in Paris, but modern pentathlon is not currently listed to be included in the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.
Obstacle course racing was selected from 61 suggestions to replace show jumping during a consultation in October 2021. Climbing, javelin, long jump, orienteering and cyclo-cross were also considered.
Obstacle course racing has been tested in four countries throughout this year, with organisers saying there was an 88% satisfaction rating from participants.

However, Microsoft is defending the proposed acquisition. ""This deal will expand competition and create more opportunities for gamers and game developers as we seek to bring more games to more people,"" according to a spokesman.  
Almost two weeks ago, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) raised similar concerns in their complaint. The US business watchdog said Activision was one of a small number of top video game developers that made high-quality games for multiple devices.
roposed acquisition would give Microsoft ""both the means and motive to harm competition"" by manipulating pricing, making games worse on its competitors' video game consoles, ""or withholding content from competitors entirely, resulting in harm to consumers,"" the agency said in a press release.  
After the FTC filed its lawsuit, Microsoft president Brad Smith said the company had ""complete confidence in our case and welcome the opportunity to present our case in court"".

UK inquiry will have to co-ordinate with the Scottish investigation.
Its chairwoman Lady Poole quit for personal reasons and was last week replaced by Lord Brailsford.
Four members of the Scottish inquiry's legal team also stood down last month.
Ms Mitchell said in light of the ""unfortunate difficulties"" the families were keen to ensure co-operation between the UK and Scottish proceedings.

A hearing into the death of David Schofield Diamond found ""serious failings"" at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire.
79-year-old was admitted with pneumonia and sepsis two weeks before his death in November 2021.
Betsi Cadwaladr health board told the inquest plans to improve had been made.
Mr Diamond, from Prestatyn, had also tested positive for Covid-19 and was having difficulties eating and drinking. 
He was initially placed in the high dependency area of the Covid ward and his breathing was assisted, the hearing was told.
He was also assessed by the speech and language team, who recommended a soft diet of mildly thickened fluids. 
After about 10 days, his condition began to improve and healthcare staff discussed a discharge plan with him and his daughter. 
But when he was moved into another area on the same ward, the information regarding his fluids and diet was not transferred with him to the whiteboard above his new bed. 
ree days before his death, a physiotherapist noticed unthickened drinks on his bedside table, some of which had been consumed. 
On 11 November, Mr Diamond's condition deteriorated to a point where an assessment should have been made by the on-call doctor, with two-hourly observations then taken, and the nurse-in-charge informed. 
However, no observations were made for seven hours and the nurse-in-charge was not told. 
His condition continued to deteriorate and he became unresponsive. A chest X-ray showed there had been aspiration, and he was placed on intravenous antibiotics, but Mr Diamond died on 13 November. 
In a statement read to the coroner's court in Ruthin, the bank nurse looking after Mr Diamond overnight, Gwenda Long, said she had assumed the healthcare support team would do Mr Diamond's two-hourly observations. 
She said she did not escalate his condition to the nurse-in-charge or the assessment team because she had ""misread the term ward-based care"" in his notes, and thought medical escalation was not necessary. 
Giving a narrative conclusion, David Lewis, assistant coroner for north Wales, east and central, said the case showed a ""lack of recognition of deteriorating patient"" with ""human and communication errors"" involved. 
Mr Lewis said that though Mr Diamond had died from pneumonia, a natural cause, the aspiration that played a part was not natural, and it was ""likely"" he aspirated due to consumption of unthickened fluid in the hospital, in spite of recommendations. 
Mr Lewis added that though he could not be satisfied that it would have made a difference to Mr Diamond had a doctor been called at an earlier stage when his condition deteriorated, there had been ""serious failings"" in his care.  
Jane Woollard, associate director of nursing for the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board told the inquest that an improvement plan had been put in place following an investigation into Mr Diamond's death, which included the introduction of colour-coded information sheets on dietary requirements which move around the hospital with patients and a plan to train all nurses to carry out swallow assessments. 
Mr Diamond's daughter, Jody Diamond said she felt let down and was ""heartbroken"" by the loss of her father. "	/news/uk-wales-63639930
technology	Heatwave forced Google and Oracle to shut down computers	"As record temperatures hit much of the UK on Tuesday, tech giants Google and Oracle suffered outages as cooling systems failed at London data centres. 
Data centres are large highly secure buildings that hold banks of computers and are the powerhouses behind many online services.
But the concentrated computing power generates heat so powerful that cooling is essential.
Both companies say the problems have now been resolved.
Oracle, a large American database software and technology business, reported overheating problems just before 16:00 BST.
""Following unseasonably high temperatures in the UK south (London) region, two cooler units in the data centre experienced a failure when they were required to operate above their design limits,"" the company wrote on a status page first spotted by The Register.
""As a result, temperatures in the data centre began to climb, which caused some systems to shut down as a protective measure.""
mpany said the issue was resolved, in an update posted shortly after 10:00 BST on Wednesday.
As Britain baked, overheating also hit a Google Cloud data centre location in London.
Google Cloud lets other businesses do work on the company's computers.
Just after 18:00 BST, the company reported that ""there has been a cooling-related failure in one of our buildings"". 
In order to prevent damage to machines and an extended outage, the firm said it powered down some of them.
roblem was fixed by 07:00 BST on Wednesday and the company said that only a ""small set of our customers"" were affected.
Because the data processed can be highly valuable to their customers, data centres are built with many back-ups, including plenty of cooling capacity.
Experts the BBC spoke to on Monday doubted that modern data centres would experience difficulties, so the failures at big, well-resourced, companies like Google will have come as a surprise.
But operators were wary of the unprecedented temperatures.
Paul Hone, of Redcentric, which operates data centres in Harrogate, London, Reading and Cambridge, told the BBC that the firm had put its disaster recovery plan into action on Monday. 
Mr Hone added that while data centres are designed to withstand hot weather, the heatwave's temperatures would be at the ""upper end of design expectations for a lot of data centre operators"".
In the end, for Mr Hone, Tuesday passed without incident.
But additional cooling means additional electricity consumption, which in turn can mean increased carbon emissions. 
With climate scientists warning that very hot days will become more frequent, tech firms are exploring greener cooling solutions and computer systems that consume less power and generate less heat.
Microsoft carried out an experiment with an underwater data centre off Orkney in 2020. Part of the attraction was the natural cooling provided by the surrounding seawater."	/news/technology-62202125
politics	PMQs: Rishi Sunak 'shocked' by allegations about Tory peer Michelle Mone	"Starmer: How did Baroness Mone get taxpayers' money?
Rishi Sunak said he was ""shocked"" to read allegations about Baroness Mone, adding it was ""absolutely right"" that she is no longer attending the Lords.
r is taking a leave of absence amid claims she benefited from a firm she recommended for a Covid contract.
Asked about the allegations at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Sunak said she ""no longer has the Conservative whip"".
A spokesperson for the peer said: ""Baroness Mone's legal team are dealing with this witch-hunt situation.""
Downing Street said not having the Tory whip was an automatic consequence of her requesting a leave of absence from the House of Lords.
Baroness Mone has been linked to PPE Medpro, which won government contracts worth £203m to supply masks and medical gowns during the pandemic, after she recommended it to ministers.
An investigation in the Guardian based on leaked documents alleged Baroness Mone had financially benefited from the company.
At PMQs, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asked Mr Sunak: ""How did his colleague Baroness Mone end up with nearly £30m of taxpayers' money in her bank account?""
Mr Sunak told him: ""The one thing we know about him is he is a lawyer, he should know there is a process in place. It is right that that process concludes. I hope that it is resolved promptly.""
He added: ""Like everyone else I was absolutely shocked to read about the allegations.
""It's absolutely right that she is no longer attending the House of Lords and therefore no longer has the Conservative whip.""
Baroness Mone's spokesman said on Tuesday she was taking a leave of absence from the House of Lords ""in order to clear her name of the allegations that have been unjustly levelled against her"".
Lords' standards watchdog is investigating the peer over her alleged involvement in procuring contracts for PPE Medpro, although this has been paused ""while the matter is under investigation by the police or another agency as part of a criminal investigation"".
Baroness Mone has consistently denied any ""role or function"" in the company, and her lawyers have previously said she is ""not connected to PPE Medpro in any capacity"".
government has committed to releasing documents to MPs surrounding the award of contracts to the PPE Medpro firm, after Labour won a vote in the Commons on Tuesday."	/news/uk-politics-63888582
sports	Matheson Hurdle: State Man comprehensive winner of Grade One race at Leopardstown	"State Man continued his march towards a likely clash with Constitution Hill at the Cheltenham Festival in March with victory in the Matheson Hurdle at Leopardstown on Thursday.
Ridden by Paul Townend, the 4-6 favourite won the two-mile race by four and a quarter lengths from Vauban, with Sharjah third. All three horses are trained by Willie Mullins.
uccess made it a hat-trick of Grade One wins for State Man, who is 4-1 with Coral for the Champion Hurdle, with Constitution Hill 2-7 favourite.
Nicky Henderson's Constitution Hill is long odds-on to lift the Champion Hurdle crown in March following his latest demolition job in the Christmas Hurdle at Kempton on Boxing Day.
And while the unbeaten five-year-old's entourage are unlikely to be quaking in their boots, State Man gave further evidence he may well prove his biggest threat with an authoritative display.
A well-backed winner of the County Hurdle in the Cotswolds last season and successful on his reappearance in last month's Morgiana Hurdle at Punchestown, State Man lined up as favourite in the feature event on day four of Leopardstown's Christmas Festival.
Sharjah, ridden by the champion trainer's son Patrick, was bidding to better hurdling legends Istabraq and Hurricane Fly by winning a remarkable fifth successive Matheson Hurdle, and yet he was only third in the betting at 6-1, behind State Man and his Triumph Hurdle-winning stablemate Vauban at 11-4.
Rank outsider She Is Electric took the field along for much of the two-mile journey, but predictably folded before the home turn, at which stage Townend allowed State Man to stride into the lead.
rong-travelling Vauban travelled into his slipstream at the top of the straight, but State Man soon found another gear to pull clear.
with Vauban will doubtless take plenty of encouragement from what was his first outing of the season and first start outside of juvenile company, while Sharjah was not disgraced in third."	/sport/horse-racing/64119398

Ms Truss's final speech comes after barely seven weeks in office. 
Here is her speech in full:
""It has been a huge honour to be prime minister of this great country. 
""In particular to lead the nation in mourning the death of Her Late Majesty the Queen after 70 years of service, and welcoming the accession of His Majesty King Charles III. 
""In just a short period, this government has acted urgently and decisively on the side of hard-working families and businesses. 
""We reversed the National Insurance increase. We helped millions of households with their energy bills, and helped thousands of businesses avoid bankruptcy. 
""We are taking back our energy independence, so we are never again beholden to global market fluctuations or malign foreign powers. 
""From my time as prime minister, I am more convinced than ever that we need to be bold and confront the challenges that we face. 
""As the Roman philosopher Seneca wrote: 'It's not because things are difficult that we do not dare, it's because we do not dare that they are difficult.'
""We simply can not afford to be a low growth country, where the government takes up an increasing share of our national wealth and where there are huge divides between different parts of our country.
""We need to take advantage of our Brexit freedoms to do things differently. 
""This means delivering more freedom for our own citizens and restoring power to democratic institutions. 
""It means lower taxes so people can keep more of the money that they earn, and it means delivering growth that will lead to more job security, higher wages and greater opportunities for our children and grandchildren. 
""Democracies must be able to deliver for their own people.
""We must be able to outcompete autocratic regimes where powers lies in the hands of a few, and now more than ever we must support Ukraine in their brave fight against Putin's aggression. 
""Ukraine must prevail and we must continue to strengthen our nation's defences. 
""That's what I have been striving to achieve and I wish Rishi Sunak every success for the good of our country. 
""I want to thank Hugh, Francis, Liberty, my family and friends and all the team at No 10 for their love, friendship and support.
""I also want to thank my protection team. 
""I look forward to spending more time in my constituency and continuing to serve South West Norfolk from the backbenches.

politics	Keir Starmer: Immigration not quick fix to NHS problems	"Keir Starmer says the UK is recruiting too many people from overseas into the NHS
UK is recruiting too many people from overseas into the NHS, Sir Keir Starmer has said. 
Labour leader argued immigration was not the solution to a staffing crisis as he called for more recruitment from within the UK.
It came as new data revealed staffing issues were linked to two deaths at a Glasgow hospital in one month. 
Scottish Health Secretary Humza Yousaf expects this winter to be ""one of the most difficult NHS Scotland has faced"". 
About 6,000 nursing and midwifery posts are unfilled in Scotland's NHS, while the English health service is said to be facing its worst-ever staffing crisis.
In England, 34% of doctors joining the health service last year came from overseas - up from 18% in 2014. 
Scotland's SNP government is spending £8m on hiring 750 nurses and midwives from overseas this winter. 
Labour has pledged to take on an extra 7,500 medical students every year if the party wins the next general election. 
In an interview on BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, Sir Keir said those people would be trained into the NHS ""from here"". 
Asked how many people he would be prepared to let into the country under a managed migration plan, he said: ""We don't want open borders. Freedom of movement has gone and it's not coming back.
""So that means fair rules, firm rules, a points-based system. 
""What I would like to see is the numbers go down in some areas. I think we're recruiting too many people from overseas into, for example, the health service. 
""But on the other hand, if we need high-skilled people in innovation in tech to set up factories etc, then I would encourage that.""
Labour leader said he has daily conversations with his wife Victoria, who works in the NHS, about the health service's struggles.
Asked what she says is the problem with the NHS, Sir Keir replied: ""We haven't got enough people.""
On whether he believes immigration should be used to address that issue, he said: ""I think that we should be training people in this country. 
""Of course we need some immigration but we need to train people in this country.""
Sir Keir's comments come after politicians and campaign groups criticised Home Secretary Suella Braverman's language about migrants. 
Meanwhile data obtained by Scottish Labour using freedom of information legislation shows 336 related to ""staffing/inappropriate skill mix"" were recorded by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde between July 18 and August 18. 
ude two deaths at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, while there were 59 ""near misses"" recorded across the health board.
A further 14 incidents caused illness or injury - 10 of which occurred at QEUH, according to the figures.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde confirmed investigations into the circumstances surrounding the two deaths were ongoing - but said the board could not  comment further due to patient confidentiality.
Paul O'Kane, Scottish Labour's public health spokesman, said: ""NHS workforce is overstretched and undervalued, and these terrifying figures are a glimpse of what will happen on a larger scale if the Scottish government's negligence continues.""
Humza Yousaf, the health secretary, said: ""The health service is facing a triple threat this winter - recovering from the worst effects of the pandemic, high energy costs and rising inflation, and the loss of much needed staff due to Brexit.
""Like health services across the UK and globally, we expect this winter to be one of the most difficult NHS Scotland has faced.""
He said the Scottish government's £600m health and care plan was working to recruit 1,000 new NHS staff, including up to 750 nurses, midwives and allied health professionals from overseas - with the plan also focusing on the social care sector to try to alleviate delays.
retary added that the government continues to ""take positive action to promote patient safety"", saying it had last month introduced the Patient Safety Commissioner Bill to Parliament.
""This legislation will further strengthen the patient voice within the healthcare system and take action to promote patient safety across our healthcare system as a whole,"" Mr Yousaf said.
Meanwhile a spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the Datix system - which collates data on adverse events - ""may not give an entirely accurate picture of the situation"", adding that on occasions where staffing issues are resolved quickly the system may not be updated.
He said: ""We would like to extend our sympathy to families who have lost a loved one in our hospitals.""

entertainment	Eurovision 2023: Yorkshire cities' pride despite missing out	"Leeds and Sheffield have been knocked out of the running to host next year's Eurovision Song Contest.
rtlist has been whittled down to Glasgow and Liverpool, with a final decision due ""within weeks"".
Leeds and Sheffield councils said they were both proud of the work put in on their Eurovision bids.
West Yorkshire Mayor Tracy Brabin said she was ""hugely disappointed"" Leeds was unsuccessful but wished Glasgow and Liverpool ""the best of luck"".
BBC said the two remaining cities, which have riverside arena venues, had ""the strongest overall offer"".
UK was chosen to host the contest after organisers decided it could not be staged by this year's winner, Ukraine, because of the ongoing war.
UK singer Sam Ryder finished second at this year's contest in Turin, Italy.
A hotly contested selection process saw 20 UK cities express an interest in hosting next year's show before that was narrowed down to seven, and now a final two.
Councillor Ben Miskell, Economic Development and Skills Policy Committee Deputy Chair for Sheffield City Council, said getting to the final seven showed the city had ""really meant business"".
""Loads of cities wanted to host this and it was amazing to see Sheffield and South Yorkshire get behind this bid,"" he said.
""Over the last few months we have showcased the very best of Sheffield - the love of music that runs through our veins, our stunning outdoor city, and of course our people.
""As the UK's first City of Sanctuary we have said all along we were doing this in solidarity with Ukraine and its people. 
""We have long-held and strong connections with Ukraine and they have been at the forefront of our minds throughout this bid.""
Mr Miskell said along with hosting the Women's Euros in the summer, it had some ""massive events"" coming up including the Rugby League World Cup.
Leeds City Council Leader Councillor James Lewis said the city ""did the best we could"" in its bid.
He said: ""I would like to thank our local Ukrainian community for all their support and help, and I would also like to say a massive thank you to everyone who has been involved in bringing the Leeds bid together from our own staff to all our key partners who worked so hard to bring it to life. ""

health	Scientists say eight glasses of water a day may be too much	"New research has found that the recommended eight glasses of water a day may be too much.
Scientists from the University of Aberdeen discovered the recommended intake of two litres of water a day was often more than people needed.
Given around half of the daily intake of water comes from food, scientists estimate people only really need about 1.5 to 1.8 litres per day.
findings were published in Science this week.
Previous research into water requirements used surveys applied to small samples of people.
Prof John Speakman from the University of Aberdeen told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""The original estimate of two litres a day comes from a slight miscalculation.
""The water that we'd need to drink is the difference between the total water that we need to ingest and the amount that we get from our food.
""The way they estimated the amount from food was by asking people how much they eat.
""Because people under-report how much they eat, there's a misestimate and so you overestimate the amount of water that's needed.""
But scientists have now collaborated across the world to measure exact water turnover using a stable isotope technique.
urveyed 5,604 people from 23 different countries and aged between eight days and 96 years old.
Research involved people drinking a glass of water in which some of the hydrogen molecules were replaced by a stable isotope of the element called deuterium. 
It is found naturally in the human body and is completely harmless.
rate of elimination of the extra deuterium shows how quickly water in the body is turning over.
People with a higher water turnover usually need to drink more water.
Research found that this included those living in hot and humid environments and at high altitudes, as well as athletes and pregnant and breastfeeding women.
Energy expenditure is the biggest factor in water turnover. The highest values were observed in men aged 20-35, who turned over an average of 4.2 litres per day.
reased with age, averaging 2.5 litres per day for men in their 90s.
Women aged 20-40 averaged a turnover of 3.3 litres, which also declined to 2.5 litres by the age of 90.
But water turnover is not exactly equal to the requirement for drinking water, Prof Speakman said.
He said: ""Even if a male in his 20s has a water turnover of 4.2 litres per day, he does not need to drink 4.2 litres of water each day.
""About 15% of this value reflects surface water exchange and water produced from metabolism.
""The actual required water intake is about 3.6 litres per day. Since most foods also contain water, a substantial amount of water is provided just by eating.
""This study shows that the common suggestion that we should all be drinking eight glasses of water is probably too high for most people in most situations and a 'one-size-fits-all policy' for water intake is not supported by this data.""
He said the research represented a big step forwards in predicting future water needs.
But there can be negatives in drinking too much water.
""Clean drinking water isn't free,"" Prof Speakman said.
""If people on average drink half a litre more than they need and you multiply that by 40 million adults in the UK, that means that we're needlessly drinking and peeing 20 million litres of water that we have to supply. 
""There is a cost in doing that."""	/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-63755475
health	Cancer survivor thanks comic Ed Byrne for 'life saving' joke	"A woman who discovered she had bowel cancer after watching comedian Ed Byrne's stand-up show has thanked him for his ""life-saving joke"".
Jackie Kaines Lang, 60, said Byrne's routine about going to see a GP about diarrhoea had resonated with her.
fter seeing the show in Berwick, Northumberland, Ms Kaines Lang went to see her doctor which led to her being treated seven years ago.
Byrne, who lost his brother to cancer, said doctors deserved the credit.
Ms Kaines Lang said the Irish comic told a ""long, convoluted joke"" which involved a ""reference to someone going to see their GP because they had a long-standing case of diarrhoea"".
She said: ""I thought 'do you know I have had diarrhoea for over three weeks, I ought to get this checked out, the guy's right'.
""The very next day I did phone my GP.""
She was later diagnosed with stage three bowel cancer.
Ms Kaines Lang had been unable to thank Byrne in person for the ""life-saving joke"", but BBC Radio Newcastle surprised her with a video call with the comedian.
Mr Byrne, who has appeared on numerous TV shows including Mock the Week and Live at the Apollo, said: ""I am very happy the whole thing has had a very happy resolution.
""Of all the routines I have had to suddenly be out there [in the media], why did it have to be the one about me having diarrhoea for three weeks?
""I would stop short of calling it a life-saving routine. Let me at least share the credit with the doctors, I would say they did most of the life saving.""
Ms Kaines Lang, who has written a blog post about her diagnosis for Bowel Cancer UK, urged other people to see a doctor if they have concerns.
""It's about knowing your body and if things aren't normal then go and get them checked out,"" she advised.
According to the NHS, common symptoms for bowel cancer include:

politics	Budget fears voiced as Scottish prison energy bills soar	"Scottish Prison Service's gas and electricity bills have rocketed by 47% as it faces the threat of budget cuts.
rvice says the cost of providing food for prisoners has risen by almost 17% and could increase by up to 30%.
However, the Scottish government is proposing that the budget for the criminal justice system will remain flat over the next four years.
rison service's chief executive Teresa Medhurst said it was already under pressure due to inflation.
She warned the service had ""no or very limited scope"" for making savings.
Ms Medhurst has told the Scottish Parliament's criminal justice committee that a budget freeze could threaten its operational stability and leave it open to challenges under human rights legislation.
She also warned that essential rehabilitative regimes could be lost and health and welfare support put at risk.
Ms Medhurst said the 47% increase in gas and electricity prices - which are expected to reach £15m in the current financial year - had ""created a significant pressure"" on the SPS budget.
She added that the cost of food for prisoners was already a ""key cost pressure"", and that over the next six months the annual inflation could reach 30%. Food costs are expected to be £7.4m in 2022/23.
In a resource spending review published in May, the Scottish government proposed a flat cash settlement for the criminal justice system until March 2027.
Ms Medhurt's concerns over this proposal have been echoed by His Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland, Wendy Sinclair-Gieben.
Speaking during a visit to HMP Shotts in Lanarkshire, she said: ""I'm very concerned about it. 
""This is a service that provides containment for the most dangerous and the most vulnerable in society for Scotland.
""To have a flat cash settlement will have a massive impact on how they cope with that.""
Scottish Prison Service operates 13 prisons and two community custody units for women, with 4,500 staff and about 7,500 inmates.
HMP Shotts is the national facility for long-term prisoners. Of the 540 men behind its bars, 240 are serving life sentences.
Its governor, William Stuart, said the jail's food and utility bills had increased significantly. The service is also facing demands for increased wages.
He said: ""It is going to make it much more difficult in the future to operate the way we do right now, so we may have to make decisions about doing things differently from what we're doing today.""
He said this could result in fewer opportunities for prisoners.
""We may not be able to provide the full range of activities and regime we have just now,"" he said.
""We may have to look at our staffing profile, which in my opinion would make the prison more unsafe. I would be worried about the safety of our staff and the safety of those we look after.""
riminal justice committee at the Scottish Parliament is due to hear evidence on Wednesday from officials from the prison service, courts service and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.
xpressed concern about the flat cash settlement proposed in the spending review.
urts service and Crown Office say budget cuts will hamper their efforts to address the backlog of cases caused by the pandemic and could halt the development of new initiatives to deal with sexual offences.
In response, the Scottish government said that the review published in May lays out ""high level resource spending plans"" and is not a budget.
It called on the UK government to use its financial and economic powers to provide support for public services ""in these difficult times"".
UK government has said it provided Holyrood with a record £41bn per year for the next three years, ""the highest spending review settlement since devolution"".
A spokesman said: ""The Scottish government is receiving around £126 per person for every £100 per person of equivalent UK government spending in England over the next three years.""
mments came as the chief inspector of prisons published a report on HMP Shotts.
It said the facility was safe and well run but faced challenges because of a shortage of NHS staff to provide medical care.
Ms Sinclair-Gieben said the prison's ""confidence"" had been affected by a period of significant incidents earlier this year, but the national introduction of photocopying of prisoner mail had led to ""a welcome reduction in drug related incidents""."	/news/uk-scotland-63477649

business	Recession looms as UK economy starts to shrink	"UK economy shrank between July and September as the country heads into what is expected to be the longest recession on record.
my contracted by 0.2% during the three months as soaring prices hit businesses and households.
A country is in recession when its economy shrinks for two three-month periods in a row. The UK is expected to be in one by the end of the year.
Bank of England has forecast a ""very challenging"" two-year recession.
A recession has been widely expected in the UK due to the prices of goods such as food, fuel and energy soaring, which is down to several factors, including the war in Ukraine.
Higher prices for goods has led to many households facing hardship and cutting back on spending, which has started to drag on the economy.
When a country is in recession, it's a sign that its economy is doing badly.
During recessions, companies typically make less money and the number of people unemployed rises. Graduates and school leavers also find it harder to get their first job.
means the government receives less money in tax to use on public services such as health and education.
Bank of England expects the UK recession to be the longest since records began in the 1920s and said unemployment will almost double.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said he would try to make any recession ""shallower and quicker"" than predicted.
But he has warned of ""eye-watering"" decisions needed on public spending and taxation to ""restore confidence and economic stability"".
Mr Hunt said he was ""under no illusion that there is a tough road ahead"".
He is set to unveil his tax and spending plans next week in the Autumn Statement, which comes as households are being squeezed by the worst cost-of-living crisis since the 1950s.
Sam Burrows, managing director of Bristol Beer Factory, told the BBC he has been weighing up how much of his soaring business costs can be passed on to customers in recent months.
""We can't price consumers out. We need people in pubs eating, drinking and enjoying the hospitality sector, so it's a balancing act for me,"" he said.
Mr Burrows said he wanted to invest and expand his business but was having to factor in the current economic climate.
However, he said the World Cup and Christmas were coming at the right time.
""A bit of national pride and some positive energy with a good performance in the World Cup, Christmas spending, it's all going to help hospitality,"" he added.
Countries all around the world are experiencing high price rises, but the UK economy is performing the worst compared to other major nations, and is smaller than it was before the Covid pandemic.
Office for National Statistics (ONS), which published the economic growth figures, said UK business investment had dropped in the three months to September and also remained below its pre-pandemic levels.
rformance of the economy is measured by the value of all the goods and services produced by the UK. This number is known as the gross domestic product (GDP).
fall in GDP in the three months to September was driven by a decline in manufacturing, which was seen ""across most industries"", the ONS said.
ONS publishes its estimate of GDP and does sometimes revise it upwards or downwards. For example, it initially estimated that the economy shrank by 0.3% in August, but later revised that and said it shrank by 0.1%.
Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said customer-facing industries also ""fared badly"", with shops hard hit as the squeeze on household budgets meant people were spending less.
According to Mr Morgan, the biggest concerns businesses said they were now facing were the rising price of raw materials and higher energy costs.
He said some firms had taken action to reduce costs by being ""far more diligent"", switching to more energy-efficient equipment, and changing supplier.
Mr Morgan said the additional bank holiday for Queen Elizabeth II's funeral played a part in the economy's poor performance in September as some businesses closed or had shorter opening times. The economy shrank by 0.6% alone in September.
Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the latest economic figures were ""another page of failure in the Tories' record on growth"".
""Britain's unique exposure to economic shocks has been down to a Conservative-led decade of weak growth, low productivity and underinvestment and widening inequality,"" she added.
Martin McTague, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, called the latest economic figures ""dreadful news"" for firms that were already under pressure.
""Lower levels of reserves and resources mean they are more vulnerable to downturns, and at a time when confidence is deteriorating in both consumers and businesses, the outlook for the UK economy is now very bleak indeed,"" he said."	/news/uk-63582201

business	Cost of living: New average mortgage rates fall below 6%	"New average two and five-year fixed-rate mortgages now have an interest rate of less than 6% for the first time for two months, data shows.
Financial information service Moneyfacts said the typical two-year deal on the market now had a rate of 5.99%, and was likely to fall further.
Mortgage costs had surged after the mini-budget, peaking at 6.65%.
rage five-year fixed-rate deal dropped below 6% nearly two weeks ago, and is now at 5.78%.
""It appears lenders are slowly making reductions to their fixed pricing to adjust their positions, and in doing so, the overall average two and five-year fixed mortgage rates now sit below 6%,"" said Rachel Springall, from Moneyfacts.
""In the weeks to come rates could fall further, particularly if mortgage lenders have targets to meet as we edge closer to the end of 2022.
""As the mortgage market remains volatile, it is vital borrowers seek independent advice to consider the deals on offer to them, or whether they need to be a little patient in hopes rates will fall further.""
Fixed-rate mortgage deals have a set interest rate during the term of the deal. Most run for two or five years, but longer deals are available. Variable or tracker rate mortgages can change at any time, usually in response to decisions made by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee on the benchmark Bank rate.
Anyone coming to the end of their fixed-rate mortgage deal and looking for a new one, or first-time buyers taking out their first mortgage saw these loans become much more expensive than they had probably expected or planned for. The rates are much higher than the norm of the last decade or so.
Rates on new fixed-rate deals have climbed throughout this year, as the Bank put up interest rates to fight inflation, but they shot up following the mini-budget.
However, they stabilised in the run-up to, and after, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's Autumn Statement which calmed the markets and, in turn, eased uncertainty for lenders and borrowers.
Anyone taking out a new mortgage is likely to still pay a much higher rate than on their previous deal. The average two-year deal stood at 2.34% at the start of December last year, ahead of a series of base rate increases by the Bank.
umber of deals available also dropped sharply after the mini-budget. It has mainly recovered but it is still much lower than it was last year, with 3,705 deals on the market."	/news/business-63858641
technology	Iran protests: US to ease internet curbs for Iranians	"US says it will ease internet curbs on Iran to counter Tehran's clampdown on protests which were sparked by a woman's death in police custody.
""We are going to help make sure the Iranian people are not kept isolated and in the dark,"" said US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken.
relaxation of software controls will allow American tech firms to expand their business in Iran.
At least 35 people have been killed in the worst unrest in Iran for years.
Mahsa Amini, 22, fell into a coma last week, hours after morality police arrested her for allegedly breaking headscarf rules. 
Officers reportedly beat Ms Amini's head with a baton and banged her head against one of their vehicles. The police have said there is no evidence of any mistreatment and that she suffered ""sudden heart failure"".
Anti-government protests continued for an eight straight night on Friday, while pro-regime rallies also took place in Tehran and other cities. 
Mr Blinken said the partial relaxation of internet restrictions was a ""concrete step to provide meaningful support to Iranians demanding that their basic rights be respected"". It was clear, he added, that the Iranian government was ""afraid of its own people"".
US treasury said the move would help counter the Iranian government's attempt to ""surveil and censor"" its people.
But it is unlikely to have an immediate impact as it ""does not remove every tool of communications repression"".
Billionaire Elon Musk said on Twitter that he would activate his satellite internet firm, Starlink, to provide internet services to Iran in response to Mr Blinken's announcement.
Starlink provides internet services via a huge network of satellites and is aimed at people who live in remote areas who cannot get high-speed internet.
US officials said that the updated license did not cover hardware supplied by Mr Musk but his firm and others were welcome to apply for permission to the treasury.
Footage shared on social media on Friday showed large crowds of protesters gather in several Tehran neighbourhoods after dark, while other incidents occurred elsewhere the country. In the protests women have defiantly taken off their hijabs and burned them, or cut off their hair in front of cheering crowds. 
While spreading across much of the country, many of the early protests were concentrated in western Iran, particularly areas with large Kurdish populations, the group Ms Amini belonged to.  
On Friday, reports emerged from Oshnavieh, in Iran's West Azerbaijan Province, which borders Kurdistan, showing widespread protests, as well as suggestions demonstrators had taken control of large parts of the city. The BBC was unable to confirm this. 
Videos posted from Oshnavieh showed large crowds of people marching through city streets with no police presence, while loud explosions could be heard. 
Friday also saw pro-regime demonstrations in Tehran and other cities, with those present declaring support for Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been a target of anti-government protesters. 
President Ebrahim Raisi spoke at a pro-government event, saying he would not allow the country's security to be ""threatened"". 
""We will not allow people's security to be put at risk under any circumstances,"" he said, shortly after returning from the United Nations General Assembly in New York. 
Stressing that Iran's ""enemies"" wanted to exploit the unrest, Mr Raisi said the government would listen to criticism over Ms Amini's death, but would not be influenced by ""rioting"".

entertainment	The Smiths: Strangeways, Here We Come was unusual, drummer says	"Smiths' final album was the band's favourite despite being ""unusual sounding"", drummer Mike Joyce has said on the 35th anniversary of its release.
Strangeways, Here We Come was released on 28 September, 1987, months after the Manchester band disbanded in acrimony.
It went on to reach number two in the UK charts and was the group's most successful album in the US.
Joyce said though the band had split before it came out, it had been ""a great experience recording that album"".
Smiths, who released four studio albums across their career, are one of Manchester's most important and influential bands.
Achieving global success in their five years together, their iconic status has brought enduring fame to Joyce, guitarist Johnny Marr, bass player Andy Rourke and singer Morrissey.
Strangeways, Here We Come, which takes its name from the Manchester prison, was recorded in early 1987, but before it could be released, tensions between Marr and Morrissey saw the band split.
Joyce told BBC North West Tonight that despite what happened, it had been ""very comfortable for all of us in the studio"".
""It was a great experience recording that album,"" he said.
He added it was a very different collection to the three that had come before it, describing it as ""a story album"".
""I think it's just an unusual-sounding album,"" he said.
""There's great songs on the others, but it just pips it for me, in terms of what we ended up with as an album and the whole thing in its entirety, rather than individual songs.""
He said he remembered how much of what was included came into being during the recording sessions.
""A lot of it was written in the studio,"" he said.
""I know Johnny had a lot of ideas ready to go, but it was an album that was written in the studio.""
He said that looking back at the album, he felt like it had only been recorded ""five years ago"".
""It's pretty timeless in terms of the sounds,"" he said.
""You couldn't really put it in any decade.""
He said it had been strange at the time, putting out an album after the band split, but ""the work had already been created"".
""Every band has to end at some point and what a way to go out,"" he said.
rate the anniversary and raise money for community charity Back on Track, Joyce is raffling off the silver disc he received to mark the sale of 60,000 copies of the album.
He said he would like it to ""go to a Smiths' fan, but ultimately this is about generating funds"".
""This charity does literally save lives,"" he said.
""It helps people trying to get out of that deep well of despair and back into society.""

Smartphones and tablets, including the Apple iPhone and iPad, would have to use a USB-C charger from 2024, while laptop manufacturers would have until 2026 to make the change.
re were 602 votes in favour and 13 against, with eight abstaining.
Member states are expected to grant approval on 24 October, before the rule is signed into law at the parliament.
Following a provisional agreement by the European Union, in June 2022, the UK government told BBC News it was not ""currently considering"" introducing a common charging cable.
But under the current post-Brexit arrangements, the new regulation could apply to Northern Ireland.
""new requirements may also apply to devices sold in Northern Ireland under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit agreement, potentially triggering divergence of product standards with the rest of the UK"", according to a December 2021 parliamentary report.

A row between the UK and EU about how to reform the Northern Ireland protocol remains unresolved.

But Apple has historically argued against the proposal.

health	China ends Covid quarantine for travellers in January	"China will scrap quarantine for travellers from 8 January, officials said, marking the last major shift from the country's zero-Covid policy. 
After almost three years of closed borders, this will reopen the country to those with work and study visas, or seeking to visit family.
ravel overseas for Chinese citizens will become easier, the immigration authority said on Tuesday.
Covid has spread ferociously in the wake of restrictions being lifted.
Reports say hospitals are overwhelmed and elderly people are dying.
rue toll - daily case counts and deaths - is currently unknown because officials have stopped releasing Covid data. 
Beijing had reported about 4,000 new Covid infections each day last week and few deaths.
On Sunday it said it would stop publishing case numbers altogether. But British health data firm Airfinity estimated China was experiencing more than a million infections and 5,000 deaths a day.
China is the last major economy in the world to move to ""living with Covid"" after three years of lockdowns, closed borders and mandatory quarantine for Covid cases and contacts. 
-called zero-Covid approach battered the economy and made citizens weary of restrictions and repeated tests. 
Resentment against the policy exploded into rare public protests against President Xi Jinping in November, which was followed by authorities dropping Covid rules just a few weeks later.
Closed borders remain the last major restriction. Since March 2020, anyone entering China had to undergo mandatory quarantine at a state facility - for up to three weeks at a time. That was recently reduced to five days. 
But on Monday the National Health Commission announced that Covid would be formally downgraded to a Class B infectious disease on 8 January. 
meant quarantine would be axed - although incoming travellers will still need to take a PCR test. A cap on the daily number of flights allowed into China would also be scrapped.
Authorities said they would also ""optimise"" visa arrangements for foreigners wishing to come to China for work and study, as well as family visits and reunions. 
It's unclear if that includes tourist visas, but officials said a pilot programme would begin for international cruise ships.
Chinese citizens wishing to apply for passports to travel abroad will also be able to do so from 8 January, the immigration authority announced on Tuesday.
Prior to the pandemic, the number of outbound tourists from China stood at 155 million in 2019, according to Statista. This number dropped to 20 million in 2020.
w rules have been welcomed by many Chinese who will now be able to travel overseas again. 
untry's top online travel agencies reported a spike in traffic within hours of the announcement. Many people will be hoping to visit family and loved ones during Chinese New Year, which begins on 22 January.
But many have also expressed anger over the sudden freedom after years of controls.
""I'm happy about it but also speechless. If we're doing this [reopening] anyway - why did I have to suffer all the daily Covid tests and lockdowns this year?"" said Rachel Liu, who lives in Shanghai.
She said she had endured three months of lockdown in April, but nearly everyone in her family had become infected with the virus in recent weeks.
She said her parents, grandparents and partner - living across three different cities in Xi'an, Shanghai and Hangzhou - had all come down with fever last week.
Many have also expressed concern online about borders reopening as Covid cases peak in China.
""Why can't we wait until this wave passes to open up? The medical workers are already worn out, and old people won't survive two infections in one month,"" read one top-liked comment on Weibo.
People in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, which experience chilly temperatures in the winter, say they're running out of flu and cold medicine. 
It's feared that hundreds of deaths may be going unreported as crematoriums are overwhelmed. 
In the capital, Beijing, authorities say they are planning to distribute the Pfizer tablets, Paxlovid, in order to try and reduce the severity of infections and ease the pressure on hospitals. But health centres contacted by The Global Times on Monday said the drug had yet to be delivered.
On Monday, President Xi issued his first remarks on the changes, calling on officials to do what was ""feasible"" to save lives. 
State media quoted him saying the country faced a new situation with pandemic control, and needed a more targeted response.
China's about-turn on how it manages the pandemic has put Mr Xi in a tough spot. He was the driving force behind zero-Covid, which many blamed for restricting people's lives excessively and crippling the economy. 
But having abandoned it, analysts say he now has to take responsibility for the huge wave of infections and hospital admissions. Many have questioned why the country was not better prepared.

politics	Schools Bill scrapped, education secretary says	"A bill designed to ""raise education standards"" in England has been dropped, the education secretary has said. 
Schools Bill included plans for a register of children not in school and measures to help with plans for all schools to join multi-academy trusts.
It has hit hurdles since it was introduced this year.
Gillian Keegan said parts of the government's plan did not need legislation and were being implemented.
A head teachers' union said it hoped a register for children could still be introduced.
Speaking to MPs, she confirmed that the bill ""will not progress"" to its third reading in the House of Lords.
Ms Keegan said ""parliamentary time has definitely been reprioritised"" to focus on tackling the rising cost of living, ""because of the pandemic aftershocks but also the war in Ukraine"". 
However, she said ministers ""remain committed"" to the objectives of the Schools Bill, and would be ""prioritising some aspects of the bill as well to see what we can do"".
""A lot of the Schools White Paper is being implemented and didn't require legislation in many cases,"" she said - referring to a policy document that set out the government's vision for education this year, some of which was meant to be achieved through the Schools Bill. 
Ms Keegan said a register of children who are not in school was ""definitely a priority"". Robin Walker, chairman of the education committee of MPs, said he wanted to hear how that would be legislated for instead. 
Schools White Paper, published in March, included plans for a minimum week length and higher English and maths targets. 
It also proposed a target for all schools to be part of a group of academies, or in the process of joining one, by 2030, and for a register of children who are not in school.
government wanted to use the Schools Bill to legislate on issues such as the structure and regulation of academies, school attendance, and school funding.
But the legislation has hit hurdles since it was introduced this year, with peers in the House of Lords calling proposals on academies a ""power grab"" that gave the government too much control.
In June, the government gutted its own bill, removing 18 clauses relating to the regulation of academies.
It had been due to come back with new proposals - until now.
rapping of the bill is likely to disappoint Conservative MPs who had hoped to use it to overturn a ban on new grammar schools. 
National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said it was ""inevitable"" the government would ""eventually have to scrap"" the bill.
He was ""pleased to see it won't go ahead in its current form"".
But it was ""a shame that the sensible and necessary elements of the bill that we did support have been thrown into the long grass alongside the others"". 
""The introduction of a register of children not in school, for example, is something we believe is important to improve safeguarding for children, as is the crackdown on illegal schools,"" Mr Whiteman said.
""We hope these elements of the bill won't be lost entirely."" 
Julie McCulloch, of the Association of School and College Leaders, said proposals in the White Paper such as the minimum school-week length now appeared ""to be in limbo"".
Labour's shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said the bill had been the government's ""priority"". The Conservative Party had ""no idea how to improve education"" but Labour would end tax breaks for private schools to ""deliver thousands more teachers, professional careers advice, and mental-health guidance""."	/news/education-63887910
business	Train strikes: Why haven't they caused more disruption?	"rail strikes this week had threatened to bring the country to a halt. 
But after two days of industrial action -  as well as the knock-on impact on services for the rest of the week - there is little evidence this has happened.
Empty stations, half-full trains to Glastonbury Festival, and broadly similar traffic levels mean that for the most part, it appears to have been business as usual for many people across the country. 
However, for those who can't work remotely and city centre businesses which rely on footfall from office workers and commuters, the impact has still been substantial.
mic has meant many firms are now geared up to switch to remote working.
According to official figures, 38% of workers now spend some of the week working from home.
One office workspace firm in Cheltenham has seen a 30% upturn in business this week from people booking individual day passes.
Claire Storey, founder of the Workplace Network in Cheltenham, says she has a lot of clients who normally commute once or twice a week but during the strikes were unable to do so, meaning they booked more days at her co-working space.  
Office occupancy data across the UK on Tuesday was just 22%, compared to 40% the same day last week, according to workplace technology firm Freespace. 
Ben Willmott, head of public policy for HR trade body the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, says more flexible ways of working have helped employees work from home with short notice.
""This takes pressure off the public transport system and reduced services for those who do have to travel to work,"" he adds. 
Pre-pandemic, the rail strikes would have taken more of a toll on Leeds Building Society, but boss Richard Fearon says a 30% reduction in the number of people in the office went ""seamlessly"".
""In 2019, we only could accommodate about 120 people working from home but now we can accommodate 1,000 wfh and can take these things in our stride,"" he adds. 
Working from home and the high cost of fuel also seem to have mitigated the impacts on the roads. 
AA says it appears most drivers have been able to go about their journeys ""without too much disruption"". AA breakdown rates are also slightly lower than usual. 
""It looks like the early strike notice has given those who can work from home the chance to continue to do so while those who have to travel to work appear to have planned ahead by setting off early and car-sharing,"" a spokesperson says. 
AA's data showed some localised congestion close to major events like Glastonbury and Goodwood festivals, but it expected this to ease once festival-goers are on-site. 
More drivers are also choosing to car-share, according to Liftshare.com, who are seeing a new member added to their network every minute.
National Highways also said there hadn't been a spike in traffic, with levels down 1% on Tuesday compared to 2019. 
Location technology firm TomTom found congestion had increased ""only slightly"" on Thursday morning across most UK cities compared to the same time a week ago.
When people did need to travel, many appear to have turned to other modes of transport.
On the first day of the strike there was a big jump in the number of people using cycle and e-scooter hire in London.
Santander Cycle hires, which typically number about 30,000 per day, jumped to 67,000 hires on Tuesday, Transport for London said. This is the second biggest day for the scheme since it began.
E-scooters in London have had around 6,500 hires per day in June but this jumped to more than 10,000 hires on Tuesday.
A rise in bus use was recorded by National Express, which saw a ""significant increase"" in enquiries and bookings for strike dates. The firm said all of its services are ""very busy"" this week, with 70% of seats sold out across its UK-wide network. It anticipates this to hit close to 90% by the week's end.  
Meanwhile, Uber said demand in London was up by around 50% on Tuesday. However this reduced significantly on Thursday, which the company said could be an indication of more people working from home. 
Watch BBC reporter's journey to Glastonbury Festival
Many music fans heading to Glastonbury also appear to have heeded advice to travel on other days or find other ways of getting to the festival. 
ravelling from London Paddington on Thursday morning were relieved to find the station was quiet, with plenty of space on trains. 
With fewer people commuting, businesses based in city centres have been hit by reduced footfall.
High Street footfall was 16.1% lower to 13:00 BSTon Thursday compared with the same day last week, according to retail analysts Springboard. 
In central London, the drop from last week was more than double the national average. 
Ashley Davis, who runs Morning Sunshine coffee shop at Warwick Parkway station, says the lack of footfall is ""really disheartening"". 
""If this strike action does not get sorted, if the government do not get involved, we are left as collateral damage. Our bills still have to be paid every month,"" he adds. 
So does the lack of impact on many workers mean rail unions have less power to negotiate? 
Gemma Dale, a lecturer at Liverpool John Moores University's business school, says with more office workers now able to do their job from home there is less pressure on the government to resolve the dispute than pre-pandemic. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested he's willing to wait it out - and has asked people to ""stay the course"".
But the RMT union at the centre of the dispute has said more rail strikes are ""extremely likely"" if talks between rail bosses and unions continue to fail. 
Ms Dale points out the strike is still causing disruption for those who can't work remotely. 
""It is still of course a huge issue to not have an effective rail service running across most of the country."""	/news/business-61857007

health	GPs say parents need clearer strep A advice	"GP leaders have urged the government to put out clearer advice for parents about when to seek help over potential strep A infections. 
Prof Kamila Hawthorne, of the Royal College of GPs, said many surgeries were struggling with the extra demand on top of existing pressures.
government should consider ""overspill"" services for surgeries unable to cope, she said. 
Since September, 15 UK children have died after invasive strep A infections.
udes the death of one child in Wales, and one in Northern Ireland. There have been no deaths confirmed in Scotland. 
UK Health Security Agency figures (UKHSA) show there have also been 47 deaths from strep A in adults in England. 
Most strep A infections are mild, but more severe invasive cases - while still rare - are rising.
Prof Hawthorne, said: ""We do not want to discourage patients who are worried about their children to seek medical attention, particularly given the current circumstances.
""But we do want to see good public health messaging across the UK, making it clear to parents when they should seek help and the different care options available to them - as well as when they don't need to seek medical attention."" 
Normally, mild strep A infections cause symptoms like a sore throat or skin infections.
ug can also cause scarlet fever - with a sore throat, skin rash that feels like sandpaper, a high temperature and a so-called ""strawberry tongue"".
It is treated with antibiotics which may also help reduce the risk of complications and spread of the bug. 
However, in a very small number of cases, strep A can get deeper into the body - for example, into the lungs and bloodstream - causing invasive Group A Streptococcus (iGAS), which needs immediate medical attention. 
re can be a range of symptoms at this point, as the body battles an invasive infection, including persistent high fevers, poor appetite, dehydration, altered behaviour and feeling very sleepy, 
Strep A infections tend to increase in the winter and peak in the spring, but figures show cases are rising earlier than usual this year. 
UKHSA says the last time there was a significant number of cases was in the 2017/18 season, when there were 27 deaths in children under 18 and 328 adult deaths in England.
Seasons with high cases can occur every three to four years. But social distancing measures during the pandemic may have interrupted the cycle and that could help explain the recent increase, health officials say.
So far, since September, there have been 85 cases of invasive strep A in children aged one to four in England and 60 in children aged five to nine. 
majority of cases are in people over 45.

politics	Suella Braverman was in denial over forced resignation, sources say	"Suella Braverman was ""amazed"" and ""in denial"" over being forced to resign for breaching the ministerial code, according to sources. 
Ms Braverman stood down as then PM Liz Truss's home secretary on 19 October after admitting to a ""technical infringement"" by sending an official document from a personal email account. 
A number of sources have disputed Ms Braverman's version of events. 
Rishi Sunak is facing questions over reappointing her six days later.
w prime minister defended his decision to make Ms Braverman his home secretary, saying ""she made an error of judgment, but she recognised that, she raised the matter and she accepted her mistake"".
BBC has spoken to several people with knowledge of the events surrounding Ms Braverman's resignation. 
A number of them dispute Ms Braverman's claim to have reported her mistake to the cabinet secretary - the head of the civil service - as soon as she realised.  
When confronted about her transgression she attempted to play down and explain away what had happened, sources suggested.
Ms Braverman had emailed a draft written ministerial statement on immigration policy to her close political ally, Conservative MP Sir John Hayes, using her personal email instead of her official government account.  
ument made reference to plans to ""make changes to the visa system to support economic growth"" and to ""ensure our visa system supports priority growth projects"" and ""extending the high potential individual visa route"", the BBC understands.
Ms Braverman had intended to copy in Sir John Hayes's wife, who works in his office. But she chose the wrong recipient and instead sent it to a staff member of another Conservative MP, Andrew Percy, early in the morning of 19 October. 
When Mr Percy became aware of what had happened, he approached the chief whip, who is responsible for party discipline. The chief whip in turn passed the issue on to Number 10 and the Cabinet Office. 
It's understood Mr Percy's office also made Ms Braverman aware of the error shortly after the mistaken email was received. 
Cabinet Secretary Simon Case advised then prime minister Ms Truss that ""it was an open and shut case of the ministerial code being breached"", according to one government insider. He had not by then been approached by the home secretary herself, according to sources.
Sir Keir advises Rishi Sunak: ""He should sack her - that would be the strong thing to do. That's what I would do if I was PM.""
Downing Street has insisted it won't comment on the ""timeline"" of events. 
One source told me ""initially [Ms Braverman] was in a state of denial"" when Ms Truss made it clear that afternoon she would have to resign. 
""She was saying it was a minor thing,"" the same source added.
Another said Ms Braverman was ""amazed"" that Ms Truss took the view she did. 
A source close to the home secretary said any suggestion she was confronted by the cabinet secretary with evidence of the breach was false, adding: ""In advance of the meeting with the prime minister, she had communicated it proactively via official channels, to the cabinet secretary.""
Instead of waiting for the resignation to be choreographed by Number 10, Ms Braverman published her resignation letter on Twitter last Wednesday evening. 
In the letter, Ms Braverman said she had ""serious concerns"" about Ms Truss's government's commitment to reducing migration numbers.
Labour is calling on Mr Sunak to sack Ms Braverman, claiming that she poses a potential security risk.
rty is also demanding ""urgent reassurances"" that the leaked email did not contain ""market sensitive information""."	/news/uk-politics-63433252
entertainment	Angry Dan mural project 'brings colour' to Cleator Moor	"A street artist is ""bringing colour"" to a Cumbrian town in a project inspired by five great British artists.
Angry Dan is creating five murals in Cleator Moor to celebrate the work of William Wordsworth, JMW Turner, Beatrix Potter, John Ruskin and LS Lowry.
reet artist and poet's latest work is influenced by the area's ""historic importance as a location for artistic inspiration"".
He said the response from the local community has been ""fantastic"".
""So many people of all ages have come up to say hello and ask about the project.
""I ran out of white acrylic paint yesterday, and a local artist, Richard Wood, invited me to his studio and gave me a pot of his own supply.""
Angry Dan, from Walthamstow, east London, is known for his vibrant colours and memorable rhymes - writing an original limerick which he paints on each mural.
One of the five murals is now complete on the Columba Club - the former Co-op - in the town square.
38-year-old said it ""seemed fitting"" the mural should be dedicated to Lowry's time in the town.
""It's a building that LS Lowry came and painted and drew in the 1950s, so this mural specifically is about that artwork,"" he said.
""And it's a limerick poem - a five-line poem - which I've written on a pen pot with three crayons in to represent the pastel that Lowry used.""
During his time in the town, the artist is carrying out a series of limerick-writing workshops with children and young adults.

politics	Spy chiefs warned about tweets and TV appearances	"Concern about the growing media presence of British spies has been raised by MPs on the parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee.
A report by the ISC refers to newspaper interviews by MI5 and GCHQ bosses, and the head of MI6's Twitter account. 
Spy chiefs have also appeared on the BBC, and the head of GCHQ is set to guest edit Radio 4's Today programme.
Agencies have used social media and interviews to explain their work and increase recruitment and diversity.
In its annual report, the committee said it recognised the ""important role public outreach can play in attracting employees by opening up about the culture and working practices in such secret organisations"" - but it said such activity ""must be undertaken in a strategic and considered manner"".
It added: ""The committee is concerned that, if media engagement strategies go too far, they risk trivialising the important work of the agencies and diverting their focus from national security priorities. Social media is also known to be a battleground for covert hostile state action, so any enhanced media engagement should not undermine the agencies' ability to act covertly and keep the UK safe.""  
It pointed to a number of recent interviews by spy chiefs - and the head of MI6's Twitter account. 
Richard Moore, also known as 'C', tweets far more than any other head past or present of an agency.
MPs also pointed to anonymised media interviews with lower-ranking employees, saying there had been ""a clear step-change for the agencies, who have traditionally shied away from such exposure - particularly of junior staff"".
mmittee, chaired by Julian Lewis MP, also revealed there had been tensions over the agencies' ability to meet deadlines when providing information to the parliamentary watchdog overseeing their work.
mmittee said it had been ""severely hampered over the past year by the failure of the UK Intelligence Community to provide responses to the committee in accordance with the deadlines set"". 
It said that in its 2019-21 annual report, it had put delays down to the agencies' reduced resources during the pandemic, and their need to focus on immediate national security threats. 
""However this is no longer a credible explanation,"" it said.
report called this a ""serious issue"" which it said prevented the ISC from ""effectively performing its statutory oversight role"".  
However, in a press notice accompanying the annual report, the committee said it had been reassured that the head of the intelligence agencies ""appear to have recognised the need to address this situation and (the committee) trusts that they will now take action to improve their responses"".
But the report added there had been an ""erosion of oversight"" because of a growing number of intelligence and security activities carried out within units of government departments that the committee did not have oversight of.
report named units including the Investment Security Unit in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy; the Telecoms Security and Resilience Team in Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS); the Office of Communications in DCMS; the Counter Disinformation Unit in DCMS; the Transport Security, Resilience and Response Group in the Department for Transport; the Intelligence Policy Department in the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office; and the Joint Biosecurity Unit in Department of Health and Social Care.
mmittee said there was a previous undertaking to Parliament that the ISC would have oversight of ""substantively all of central government's intelligence and security activities"" but this had not taken place as new units had been created."	/news/uk-63962905

health	Basildon hospital: Gas and air suspended over nitrous oxide levels	"use of gas and air pain relief at a hospital maternity suite has been suspended after some staff were exposed to high levels of nitrous oxide.
rried out last year at Basildon University Hospital in Essex revealed the high levels but the installation of a new ventilation system was delayed.
mixture, Entonox, was expected to be unavailable for three weeks.
Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust said there was no harm to mothers and babies.
rust also said other pain relief methods would be available.
""We're very sorry that women using the service won't have access to Entonox,"" said acting chief executive Hannah Coffey.
""While there has been no risk of harm at all to mothers and babies who have used the unit, prolonged exposure to the gas can lead to issues with vitamin B12 deficiency.
""We need to be sure that we are keeping our staff safe, so while we urgently install a new ventilation system we have taken the difficult decision to suspend the use of Entonox.""
Acute exposure to nitrous oxide can lead to anaemia, due to the vitamin B12 depletion, and has been linked to fertility issues.
In correspondence sent to staff in October, seen by the BBC, Ms Coffey said the delay to install a new ventilation system, following the tests conducted in Basildon's delivery suite in June 2021, was ""unacceptable"".
Ms Coffey said all maternity units in the trust, including community sites, would be regularly tested.
Windows were kept open and fans kept on during the investigations.
Pregnant members of staff were redeployed to other hospital areas.
In a statement released on Thursday, she added: ""Our midwives are contacting the families we expect to have their babies at Basildon over the next three weeks to talk to them about the options available to them.""
Val Wilcox, from the Essex branch of the National Childbirth Trust, told BBC Essex: ""It's going to be really disappointing for local women who are expecting to give birth in the next few weeks because they're going to have to rethink their options.
""But it's also really disappointing that the health of our precious midwifery team has been put at risk and put at risk for quite a while.""
Another maternity department in Kent, the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, suspended use of Entonox earlier in the week.

politics	Micheál Martin wishes UK well amid 'time of uncertainty'	"(Irish Prime Minister) Micheál Martin has wished the UK government ""well in the challenging times ahead"".
He said the UK was in a ""time of political change and some uncertainty"" as it prepared to appoint a new prime minister - its third within two months.
On Monday, it was confirmed Rishi Sunak would succeed Liz Truss in Number 10.
""A stable and prosperous Britain is in all our interests,"" Mr Martin said.
He was addressing UK and Irish politicians at a meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the new prime minister will face a challenge of ensuring Northern Ireland ""does not remain endlessly in limbo"" without government.
Speaking in Belfast, she accused the DUP of ""inertia and inaction, and do-nothing politics"".
Ms McDonald said Downing Street should quickly demonstrate a willingness to get Stormont restored. 
""There certainly can't be any further delay,"" Ms McDonald said.
""We need to see an end to the brinkmanship, to the bad faith and we need to see now a good faith engagement and the making of a deal, which by the way and we have said this repeatedly, can be done very, very quickly.""
In Mr Martin's speech on Monday morning, he called for better cooperation between the UK and Irish governments on the issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
rotocol - the post-Brexit trade arrangement for Northern Ireland - has been a source of tension since it came into force at the start of 2021.
ks between the UK and the EU have resumed in an attempt to resolve the issue but there is no sign of an imminent deal.
""To the incoming British prime minister I want to stress the importance of the two governments working in partnership to support the gains of the Good Friday Agreement,"" said the taoiseach.
""I urge the new British prime minister to move quickly to genuine and substantive engagement with European Union.""
British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly - made up of politicians from both jurisdictions - meets twice a year, with this event focussing on trade and the economic effect of Brexit.
g the event also heard from Northern Ireland Office Minister Steve Baker.
He said that regardless of who became the UK's new prime minister, the government would stick to its existing policy on the Northern Ireland Protocol.
government at Stormont has not functioned fully since February when the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) withdrew from the executive in protest at the protocol.
DUP believes the protocol undermines Northern Ireland's place within the UK by effectively creating a trade border in the Irish Sea."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63365648
health	Sheffield Covid coma musician relearns guitar for comeback	"A musician who spent more than two years relearning to sing and play the guitar after being in a coma is to perform a comeback gig with his band. 
Graham Rodgers nearly died after suffering a stroke and further complications following a Covid infection in March 2020.
62-year-old from Sheffield spent a month in a coma and finally woke when nurses played him his own music.
He said performing again with his band Calico Fever ""meant everything"".
Mr Rodgers collapsed at home after having the stroke, which was caused by increased blood coagulation and clotting.
While in hospital he suffered three further minor strokes, a heart attack, pneumonia, septicaemia, blood clots on his lungs and had to be revived three times.
Mr Rodgers, from Frecheville, said: ""At one point I heard music in the distance and it got a bit louder, then I could hear some women talking and then I thought, 'they're my songs'.
""I opened my eyes and I remember a nurse saying, 'he's come back to us'.""
He was discharged after three months and since then has had to relearn to walk, talk, read and write, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said. 
Discussing relearning the guitar, he said: ""One day I picked it up and it was like going back to square one - I burst into tears because I thought I had lost music.
""But then I thought how lucky I am still to be here and how I owe it to all those people who didn't survive Covid to stick at it.""
Mr Rodgers, who has invited the medical staff who cared for him to the gig at Greystones pub in Sheffield on Saturday night, said he ""owed his life to the heroic efforts of NHS staff"".
""Saying thank you doesn't seem enough, I have a life again now,"" he added. 
""It will mean everything to perform again, it is me.""

He will have to reveal his ITV fee in a future edition of the register.
He filmed the Channel 4 show before flying out to the Australian jungle, but it will be screened next year.
Mr Hancock's controversial appearance on I'm A Celebrity ended on Sunday, when he came third. Footballer Jill Scott was crowned queen of the jungle, after a public vote.
West Suffolk MP remains suspended from the Conservative Party for taking time off from his MP duties for I'm A Celebrity.

politics	Unions will fight government over workers' rights, vows TUC	"In her final speech as TUC leader, Frances O Grady criticised government policies over workers' rights.
unions are ready to take on the government if it attempts to strip away workers' rights, the head of the Trades Union Congress has said.
government has promised to change the rules on taking strike action.
UC general secretary Frances O'Grady said it as ""a cynical move to distract from the chaos they have caused"".
But a government spokesperson said it wanted to ensure the public did not pay the price for ""disproportionate strike action"".
Ms O'Grady said the TUC had taken legal counsel over whether the government's plans to change rules governing industrial action breached the law.
""Read my lips: We will see you in court!"" she told the TUC annual conference in Brighton.
Ms O'Grady was giving her final speech as leader of the TUC - the umbrella movement for the UK's major unions. She is stepping down after almost a decade in the post. 
She used the opportunity to highlight the ""longest wage squeeze since Napoleonic times"" which she said had left UK families at breaking point,
Workers were facing two decades with no real wage growth, once inflation was taken into account, she said.
union body is warning that the anger felt by workers over falling real wages is likely to lead to hundreds of thousands joining the picket line this winter. Nurses, doctors and teachers are already being balloted on action.
week at the TUC conference unions are expected to vote in favour of co-ordinating any strikes. 
re has already been a wave of strike action affecting postal, communication and rail services. Barristers and dockworkers have also been on strike.
government has said it will do what it can to minimise disruption, and said it is confident its proposals are compliant with the UK's domestic and international legal obligations..
It said it ""makes no apology for taking action so that essential services are run as effectively as possible, ensuring the British public don't have to pay the price for disproportionate strike action"".
Under Prime Minister Liz Truss, the government has proposed requiring unions to put pay offers to a member vote before calling a strike. It also aims to introduce legislation to ensure transport companies maintain a minimum level of service during industrial action. 
government said strike action should be the result of a positive decision by union members and that those who do not support strike actions should be able to continue working through any industrial dispute.
New rules on allowing employers to hire agency workers during strikes have already been passed.
Ms O'Grady defended the right of workers to strike at a time when wages were failing to keep pace with prices.
""Just when the citizens of this country are in despair, when key-workers' kids are going to school with holes in their shoes, and young families are worried sick about taking on a mortgage - Liz Truss' top priority is to make it harder for workers to win better pay. 
""If ministers cross the road to pick a fight with us then we will meet them halfway,"" she said.
Ms O'Grady also told the conference the Business Secretary Jacob Rees Mogg wanted worker's rights derived from EU laws to be ""stripped from the statute book"" including ""holiday pay, time off for mums and dads and limits on safe working hours"".
UC estimates that real wages - which take rising prices into account - will not return to their 2008 level until 2028.
would mean a further loss in real terms of £4000, on average over the next three years, as a result of price rises outstripping wage growth. The TUC used Bank of England and Office for National Statistics data to make the calculations.
Public sector staff were quitting ""in droves"" because of poor pay rates, Ms O'Grady added.
In response, the government said it was ""determined to make work pay"" and said it had already increased the minimum wage.
A government spokesperson said it was supporting people with bills due to the impact of rising costs. 
""In the long-term, we are committed to building a high-skilled, high-wage economy that delivers on our ambition to make the UK the best place in the world to work,"" they added.
In an interview ahead of the conference Ms O'Grady said there was a ""moral and economic argument for making sure people's pay packets at least keep up with inflation"".
""The economy has become skewed,"" she told the BBC's Today programme.
""Shareholder dividends have been rising much, much faster while real pay has been falling.
""We need people to have money in their pockets to spend in pubs local shops to keep our High Streets open."""	/news/business-63287456

Steve Wright has signed off from his final daily BBC Radio 2 programme after 23 years as a fixture in the station's weekday schedules.
DJ delivered a heartfelt speech during the last edition of Steve Wright in the Afternoon on Friday.
He said: ""I want to say thank you to you for your appreciation, our dearest listener smashing and loyal, for all the reaction and all the nice words.""
He stressed that he was not retiring, and will keep his Sunday morning show.
Wright will also launch his Serious Jockin' podcast on 4 November, and will present special programmes on the station including for National Album Day on 15 October and at Christmas.
""Thank you if you've ever seen your way to listening to us over 23 years at any time,"" he told listeners. ""Thank you, thank you and thank you again.
""Corny though it sounds, I quite like the way that we've all helped each other get through some of our ongoing problems together - the pandemic, the financial downturns, the ups and downs of life in the UK. Sometimes it's been very difficult for everybody.
""[We] tried on this programme to bring just a little bit of light relief, a good genuine atmosphere, uplifting tunes, good conversation, a little bit of satire. We tried to make the show unique and just be good company. I can only hope that we've done that some of the time.
""I'm also really aware there are more things to think about than a radio show ending so I don't want to be too self indulgent. What I do want to do is celebrate the show's success and long run, and also mention that I'm not retiring!""
When the end of his ""big show"" was announced in July, the 68-year-old revealed that the head of Radio 2 had told him she wanted to do ""something different"" in his slot. He said: ""That's OK. I understand that.""
Former Radio 1 host Scott Mills will move into Radio 2's 14:00-16:00 slot later this year, with drivetime presenter Sara Cox's show extended to begin at 16:00 instead of the current 17:00.
In a statement on the Radio 2 website, Wright said: ""I know I've been extremely lucky to do this work and have never taken it for granted.""
He joked: ""There is no truth in the rumour I'm planning to open my own artisan bakery, and I've turned down twice the chance to open my own nail bar. So it's all good.
""Please do listen to Scott Mills and Sara Cox when they take over afternoons. They are both brilliant broadcasters and I truly wish them well when they start.""
Wright made his name on Radio 1 with the original incarnation of Steve Wright in the Afternoon from 1981, bringing energy, comedy and his trusty posse - and pioneering the ""zoo"" format on the UK airwaves.
He moved from afternoons to the breakfast slot from 1994 to 95 before joining Radio 2 the following year, initially on Saturday mornings before resurrecting Steve Wright in the Afternoon in 1999.

Former Radio 1 colleague Nicky Campbell earlier paid tribute to Wright on his Radio 5 Live show, describing him as a ""proper genius"" of radio.
""Just to know him and to watch him work was extraordinary,"" Campbell said. ""He's a conjurer, he's a magician, he's a high wire artist, and he's a communicator extraordinaire. He is, I'll say it again, a radio genius, and he will always be a radio hero.""

business	Airports told to stop failing disabled passengers	"Airports must stop failing disabled passengers or they could face legal action, the UK regulator has warned. 
Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said it understood the recruitment challenges facing the industry but some recent incidents were ""unacceptable"". 
In some cases disabled passengers had been left waiting hours on planes for help to get off, it said. 
ustry has been struggling with staff shortages in recent months. 
Airlines and airports cut thousands of jobs during the pandemic, when Covid restrictions virtually shut down international travel. 
However, since the demand for flights has returned they have found it difficult to recruit and train new staff quick enough, leading to delays and cancellations. 
In a letter to airports, the CAA said assistance was continuing to be provided in a timely manner ""for the vast majority of passengers"". 
But the regulator said it was ""disappointing"" there had been a ""dip in performance at some airports"" in recent months, with more disabled and less mobile passengers having to wait longer for assistance than usual. 
It said it was ""very concerned"" about increased reports of ""significant service failings"", including passenger's wheelchairs not being unloaded in a timely manner and disabled individuals being helped off planes hours after other flyers. 
CAA added that a higher proportion of passengers at some airports were also using assistance services, although the cause of this increase in demand was not clear.  
regulator said it would be asking all airports with a high number of passengers using assistance services to set out by 21 June what measures they had taken to stop ""significant service failures happening in the future"".
""We will continue to closely monitor the quality of service provided and if these significant service failures continue, we will consider what further action is needed, including using enforcement powers,"" it added. 
CAA has powers to investigate and prosecute breaches of aviation rules and some breaches of consumer protection requirements. 
Earlier this week, one disabled passenger, Victoria Brignell, said she was left on a plane at Gatwick for more than an hour and a half after it had landed, despite booking assistance three months in advance.
Another wheelchair user said he waited more than two hours for someone to help him disembark at Manchester Airport. 
Both airports apologised, with Manchester blaming staff shortages. 
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, who uses a wheelchair, said such situations were becoming ""depressingly familiar"".
""The airports seem to be slipping back. The level of investment and effort that goes into making money at these airports isn't matched by the effort and money that needs to go into getting disabled passengers off the plane at the same time as everybody else,"" he said earlier this week.

technology	Canadian admits to hacking spree with Russian cyber-gang	"An ex-Canadian government IT worker has admitted to being a high-level hacker with a Russian cyber-crime group.
Sebastien Vachon-Desjardins, from Quebec, Canada, has agreed to plead guilty in a Florida court.
34-year-old was affiliated to the NetWalker ransomware crew, which has attacked companies, municipalities, hospitals, schools and universities.
When he was arrested, police discovered he was in possession of $27m (£22.2m) in Bitcoin.
represents a rare example of a successful arrest and prosecution of a hacker working for a Russia-based cyber-crime group.
US court documents state that the Canadian was one of NetWalker's most prolific affiliates.
Evidence gathered by police shows he went on a hacking spree between April and December 2020, attacking 17 Canadian companies and many others around the world. 
NetWalker operated a ransomware-as-a-service criminal business, offering its malicious software and extortion website to hacker affiliates. 
rs, who are still at large, communicate in Russian online and ensure that their malware does not infect Russian computer systems, or those of former Soviet countries which are now members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
Affiliates like Mr Vachon-Desjardins are responsible for identifying and attacking high-value victims with the ransomware.
NetWalker developers and affiliates split the ransom or, if the victim refuses to pay, a share of the money made from selling the stolen data.
Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work?
Mr Vachon-Desjardins was arrested in Canada in January 2021 and subsequently extradited following a US investigation into the cyber-crime group, which dismantled its online operation and uncovered a database of affiliate details.
It revealed the NetWalker group had roughly 100 members, including affiliates, who extorted at least $40m from victims.
In one incident, the group extorted $1.14m from a US university trying to develop a Covid-19 vaccine.

health	Cruise ship with 800 Covid cases docks in Sydney	"A holiday cruise ship carrying about 800 passengers with Covid-19 has docked in Sydney, Australia. 
Majestic Princess cruise ship arrived at Circular Quay, having sailed from New Zealand.
About 4,600 passengers and crew were aboard the ship when it docked - meaning around one in five had Covid.
utbreak is reminiscent of the Ruby Princess cruise ship Covid outbreak of early 2020, where at least 900 people tested positive and 28 died.
Marguerite Fitzgerald, the president of cruise operator Carnival Australia, said a large number of cases started to be detected about halfway through the 12-day voyage. 
All cases were either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, she said. 
Staff would be assisting all guests who have tested positive ""with accessing private transport and accommodation to complete their isolation period"", she said. The ship will soon depart for Melbourne.
Asked about comparisons between the Majestic Princess and the Ruby Princess - which also belongs to the same operator - Ms Fitzgerald said: ""Since then, we as a community have learnt a lot, a lot more about Covid.""
utbreak comes as Covid cases rise across Australia. 
In New South Wales, 19,800 new cases were detected in the seven days to Friday. "	/news/world-australia-63605824
politics	Suspended Tory MP David Warburton breached code of conduct	"An MP breached Parliament's code of conduct over a £150,000 loan from a Russian-born businessman, a watchdog has ruled.
David Warburton failed to declare a loan given to him by Roman Joukovski via an off-shore trust while lobbying for the businessman.
He will avoid punishment after apologising for breaking the rules.
Mr Warburton lost the Conservative party whip in April after he was accused of sexual misconduct.
He previously told the BBC he had done nothing wrong.
An investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards found Mr Warburton received the loan from a foundation based in the Seychelles linked to Mr Joukovski on August 2017.  
Mr Warburton said the money was a commercial loan provided on ""non-preferential terms"", which he paid back by March 2022.
Mr Warburton told the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Stone, that he did not register the loan at the time because it was ""entirely unconnected with either my role as an MP or any parliamentary activities"".
""in no way"" ever ""influenced my words or actions as a Member"" he added in his submission to the commissioner.
After taking the loan, Mr Warburton wrote to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), urging the regulator to reconsider its assessment of Mr Joukovski after refusing to certify him as a fit or proper person.
Ms Stone said she was satisfied the loan had ""not influenced"" Mr Warburton words or actions as an MP - but ruled that it should still have been declared in the register of members' interests.
She found there had been two breaches of the MPs Code of Conduct. But the breaches were rectified after Mr Warburton wrote to the commissioner ""acknowledging and apologising for the breach"", Ms Stone ruled.
He has also agreed to add the loan to the MPs Register of Financial Interests.
Mr Warburton, who is 57, was first elected as the MP for Somerton and Frome in 2015."	/news/uk-politics-63706016
health	Isle of Man mental health scheme set to help more young people	"More young people on the Isle of Man will receive mental health treatment than anticipated as part of new support scheme, Manx Care has said.
rator has funded a charity to provide therapies as it aims to slash waiting lists for its Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service.
umber helped is now expected to rise 14%, a Manx Care spokeswoman said.
rise was due to some people not requiring as much one-to-one therapy as initially prescribed, she added.
Recent figures revealed those aged under 18 waited about six months for a routine assessment.
waiting times for children outstrip those for adults aged 18 and over seeking mental health support, who on average secure a routine appointment within two weeks. 
Local charity MCH Psychological Service has treated 148 children and young people as part of its Manx Care-backed initiative Minds Matter.
Funding was originally agreed to treat 140 people but the charity now expected to help 160 children with the resources it has available.
Manx Care's general manager of integrated mental health services Ross Bailey said he was pleased more people could access the support.
Feedback from those who had been seen had highlighted ""just how supportive and effective their therapy has been"", he added.
Andrea Chambers of Minds Matter said long waiting times were ""detrimental"" and the charity was encouraged by the ""continued focus"" on bringing them down.
In a statement, Manx Care said it was ""looking at the funding required to continue to address mental health waiting lists"".

sports	Azeem Rafiq: Hate crime inquiry after man defecates in cricketer's garden	"A hate crime investigation has been started by police after a man defecated in the garden of former Yorkshire cricketer Azeem Rafiq.
Earlier this month, the ex-bowler told MPs he had become a target of abuse since speaking out about racism.
During the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee hearing, the 31-year-old described being abused and spoke of a man ""defecating"" in his garden.
Police said they believed the incident was racially motivated.
South Yorkshire force said it was reported a man had defecated in the front garden of an address on Gawber Road in Barnsley just before 18:20 GMT on 5 October.
ued a CCTV image of a man they want to speak to in connection with their investigation and urged anyone who recognised him to contact police.
Last year, Rafiq was found to have been the victim of racial harassment and bullying while he was a player at Yorkshire County Cricket Club.
He told MPs that English cricket was ""institutionally"" racist, sparking the scandal that has dogged English cricket for much of the past two years.
His testimony led to changes in Yorkshire's leadership, Headingley being temporarily stripped of hosting international matches, and reprimands for several current and former players and coaches.
It also led to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) putting together a 12-point plan to tackle racism in the game.

sports	English Open: Ronnie O'Sullivan compares opponent to Mr Bean after fight back to reach last 32	"World number one Ronnie O'Sullivan compared Thai opponent Dechawat Poomjaeng to Mr Bean after coming back from two frames down to reach the last 32 of the English Open.
-time world champion won the match 4-2.
O'Sullivan said he was amused by Poomjaeng's ""funny faces and his mannerisms"" as he compared him to Rowan Atkinson's character.
""He should go into comedy, he'd be a great character,"" O'Sullivan said.
Speaking to wst.tv, the Englishman, 47, added: ""He's like a Mr Bean type character.
""I was enjoying just going for my shots and trying to make something happen.""
Poomjaeng, 44, is the lowest-ranked player in the world at number 130 and has returned to the tour after a five-year absence.
O'Sullivan, who made a break of 104 in the penultimate frame, added: ""I thought there was no point just trying to play straightforward snooker, let's just have a laugh.
""I went for some doubles and trebles, some of them went in, crazy things can happen when you go for it.""
fightback came after O'Sullivan suffered a scare in the first round of the tournament as 18-year-old Belgian Ben Mertens came back from a three-frame deficit to send the match to a decider.
O'Sullivan will play Martin Gould in the next round on Thursday.
In the pick of Wednesday's last-32 matches, Northern Ireland's Mark Allen produced another stunning comeback to once again get the better of Ding Junhui.
Allen, who battled back from 6-1 down to defeat Ding 10-7 in last month's UK Championship final, recovered from 3-1 behind on this occasion, securing the final three frames with breaks of 86, 94 and 113.
Last year's runner-up John Higgins pulled off a similar comeback in his 4-3 victory over Robert Milkins, while 2020 champion Judd Trump opened with a knock of 118 as he eased past Fraser Patrick 4-0, and Mark Selby overcame Wu Yize 4-1.
Australia's defending champion Neil Robertson beat Elliot Slessor 4-0 but world number seven Kyren Wilson lost 4-1 to Welshman Jamie Jones.
Elsewhere in the last-64 matches, Jack Lisowski, Barry Hawkins, Shaun Murphy and Luca Brecel were among those to join O'Sullivan in progressing.

entertainment	PnB Rock: Father and son pair charged with rapper's murder	"A father and son have been charged with the murder of rapper PnB Rock. 
musician, 30, was shot dead at a Los Angeles waffle house on 12 September.
Authorities say Freddie Lee Trone, 40, and his 17-year-old son were each charged with one count of murder, two counts of second-degree robbery and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery.
Mr Trone's wife Shauntel has also been arrested and charged with one count of being an accessory after the fact.
PnB, real name Rakim Hasheem Allen, rose to fame with the release of his 2016 hit Selfish and had collaborated with artists including Ed Sheeran.
He was having lunch with his girlfriend on the day of the shooting when a gunman approached the pair at Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles in south LA.
Police said the suspect demanded they hand over valuables shortly before he opened fire, removed items from the victim then fled in a waiting getaway car.
PnB suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead in hospital 45 minutes later.
ger, who name was not published in the charge announcement, made his initial appearance in a juvenile court and is scheduled to return on 19 October for a pre-trial hearing.
Los Angeles's top prosecutor, District Attorney George Gascón said PnB's killing had ""dimmed a bright light in the lives of his fans, friends and most importantly his family. 
""The accused individuals' alleged actions in this case were heartless and cruel and robbed the world of Mr Allen's talents.""
ributes flooded in for PnB after his death, from artists including Drake, who posted a photo of the two together on his Instagram story.
Rapper Offset posted a Twitter tribute urging followers to pray for PnB's two children, with Nicki Minaj calling him ""a pleasure to work with"".
PnB Rock was born in Philadelphia in 1991, going on to record two studio albums, Catch These Vibes and Trapstar Turnt PopStar.
He released his final song, Luv Me Again, just two days before the shooting.

business	Redundant Aberdeen paper mill workers set to take legal action	"Workers at an Aberdeen paper mill who suddenly lost their jobs last week are set to take legal action.
Stoneywood paper mill - which has operated for more than 250 years - went into administration last Thursday with the loss of more than 300 jobs.
Unite union said workers were not properly consulted over the decision.
It organised a mass meeting with solicitors on Tuesday afternoon to also cover areas such as redundancy pay outs and unpaid wages.
Staff said workers were told on Thursday afternoon to attend a meeting an hour later and were then informed administrators had been appointed.
Scottish Enterprise has given the mill owners more than £12m worth of support over the last three years.
In 2019, the business was sold to a new parent company, securing the jobs at the mill.
However, administrators have now been appointed at the Arjowiggins Group mills at Stoneywood, as well as Chartham, Kent, with 368 of the group's 463 UK-based employees made redundant immediately.
A total of 301 out of the 372 members of staff in Aberdeen were made redundant.
Across the two sites 95 staff were retained to continue limited activity while the administrators explore the possibility that the mills and assets could be sold.
Paul Kissen, from Thompsons Solicitors, briefed those present on Tuesday afternoon.
He told BBC Scotland: ""They were dismissed without any consultation whatsoever, and there's a duty on employers to carry out what's called a collective consultation where they are proposing to dismiss 20 or more people from a single workplace.
""In this case the redundancies came completely out the blue, and that means the employees are all entitled to claim a protective award, of up to 90 days' pay per employee.""
joint administrators did not wish to make any comment on any legal action that may be taken.

technology	Your next job interview could take place in virtual reality	"Going for a job interview is the stuff of nightmares for many people, while for others it is a chance to shine.
Either way you are typically still interviewed by other human beings, either after walking into a scary office with one or more bosses sitting behind a desk, or via an equally nerve-wracking Zoom call.
Yet thanks to advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) technology, you may soon be interviewed for that job you really want... by a computer. 
Earlier this year students at Sandwell College in West Bromwich put on VR headsets to do some mock interviews.
r avatars - cartoon-like, 3D representations of themselves - were put through their paces by another talking avatar representing the AI software system.
""I'd never had an interview before in my life,"" says engineering student Ayyan Ahmed. ""But because there was no human judging me, and it was all online, I could actually express myself.
""And then, at the end of the process, he [the VR interviewer] told me what I did wrong, and what I did right. It really helped me to know what to do in my next interview.""
VR system the students were using is made by London-based company Bodyswaps.
Questions and requests that the interviewees get asked range from the straightforward ""tell me about your greatest achievements"", to the more challenging ""do you prefer to be loved or feared?""
user then gets feedback, not just on what they said, but how they say it, whether they are maintaining eye contact with the interviewer avatar, and even their posture.
Bodyswaps' chief executive Christophe Mallet says the idea is that people can keep practising with the simulated job interviews until they feel ready for a real-life one.
He believes that the technology has the chance to level the playing field for candidates from less well-off backgrounds who might not otherwise have the opportunity to practise for job interviews in a professional setting.
""Things like communication, empathy and leadership are the secrets to success [in interviews], but how can you practise those? If you are rich, you can get a coach. Otherwise you have e-learning [such as watching videos on the topic], but that doesn't work as you are lacking immersion.
""Using VR and AI we now have a way to immerse you safely in a simulation where you can practise interview conversations.""
Bodyswaps launched its interview simulations last year, and says it is mainly targeting schools, colleges and universities, so their students can practise before they enter the jobs market. Its business model is subscription based, with the amount an institution has to pay each year being dependent on how many people use the system.
While Bodyswaps is currently focused on mock job interrogations, the AI technology of Swedish firm Tengai is already allowing firms out in the real world to get a computer to do their initial job interviews.
AI software is represented as a talking cartoon head that appears on the screen of a candidate's computer or smartphone. It asks a set list of questions, and then the recorded answers are used to help recruiters draw up shortlists for jobs.
gai's chief executive Elin Öberg Mårtenzon says that a central aim of the software is to avoid making wrong assumptions, such as judging someone on their appearance.
""We wanted to create a situation where you could actually look at objective data instead, by putting some sort of filter between the candidate and the recruiter,"" she says.
""And that filter is supposed to mitigate bias in the process… so that they know that they are not being judged by things other than those relating to the job description.""
But while it might be tempting to see AI and VR technology as the magical solution for selecting the right candidate for a job, employment lawyer Susan Thompson says we need to be cautious.
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
""AI doesn't eliminate risk, and it's not without risk itself,"" says the partner at London law firm Simkins. ""So I think that's the most important thing employers need to be mindful of.
""We have to remember, AI is actually still fundamentally created by a human. [So], first and foremost, I'd be saying to any employer who's thinking of using it, be it at the interview stage, or even at the exit stage, 'do you understand it, and to what extent have you spoken to the developer about what data points it uses?'
""And, has it been stress tested to eliminate bias? Does it eliminate gender bias? And how does it do that?""
Ms Thompson adds: ""I would be hesitant in advocating that AI is used exclusively in the interview process. I think there should be some sort of human intervention somewhere."""	/news/business-63311886

entertainment	Vtubers: India's virtual stars whose real faces you won't see	"JoqniX has silver-platinum hair, wears spectacles and loves meeting new people.
He livestreams - or broadcasts - himself playing popular video games on his YouTube channel for up to 12 hours. His few hundred followers enjoy watching him play or speak about the action unfolding in the game.
But JoqniX isn't real. He is a digital avatar created and managed by a student based in southern India who is not comfortable revealing more details about his location and offline life.
JoqniX is among a fast-growing niche group of virtual YouTubers, or VTubers, in India - digital personalities that have been created by online entertainers and content creators who mostly wish to keep their identities secret.
VTuber avatars usually have distinct Japanese anime-style features and they stream games, participate in internet trends, make art or music and engage in other activities online that are fun to watch. Creators say that part of the popularity of these digital personalities is that their real identities remain shrouded in mystery.
According to reports, the trend originated in Japan in 2016 with Kizuna AI, widely considered to be the first VTuber, using the term for the first time. Since then, the trend has grown in popularity with several content creators setting up quirky digital VTuber avatars, some of whom have amassed a huge fan following.
Venu G Joshi, founder of the Indian VTuber talent agency, Project Starscape, says the trend gained popularity in India during the Covid 19 pandemic. Joqnix's creator, who wished to be known only by the digital avatar, estimates that there are more than 90 VTubers in India at the moment. 
He maintains a list of Indian VTubers on Twitter and is a moderator of Discord servers - an online space for like-minded people to interact with each other via video and text chats - for the community.
menon is yet to gain mainstream popularity in India, but participants hope this could change soon. The BBC spoke to some creators of Indian VTuber accounts to better understand the trend, its appeal and purpose.
For the creator behind VTuber Suzuki Zuriko, VTubing allows her to escape the vicious trolling content creators are often subjected to online.  ""I feel it has enabled many of us, especially women, to try out content creation without feeling unsafe,"" she says. ""I don't have to worry about people making fun of my real body or making sexist comments.""
For Virtual Sakura's creator, on the other hand, the appeal of VTubing lies in the scope for creativity the trend offers. Creators can give their avatars interesting backstories - Virtual Sakura, for instance, is a 200-year-old girl with magical powers. ""Here we can make our own realities and it's beautiful,"" says the Delhi-based creator.
Creators either design their avatars - also called ""models"" - or commission artists and animators to design and create 2D or 3D versions of these models. Most models are Japanese anime-style designs, while others are modelled after other creations such as mythical creatures. A slew of apps are used to design them and their movements are controlled using face and body tracking software.
19-year-old creator of VTuber Mio - an avatar that is half cat demon and half human - has designed 10 such models so far. ""I've earned roughly $2,000 (£1,700) from making models and art commissions over the past two years,"" she says.
JoqniX's creator says that his digital avatar speaks in his own voice, even though most creators choose to use voice modulation software to give their avatars a unique voice. JoqniX speaks in a sing-song voice and often sprinkles his conversations with Japanese words. 
reator describes himself as being a ""shy and silent"" person, but says that JoqniX brings him out of his shell, at least online. ""When I started streaming, I promised myself that I'll speak up and make friends,"" he says.
While Japanese VTubers are immensely popular - many of them have millions of followers on their YouTube channels and several others are part of paid ad campaigns and launch events - Indian VTubers are yet to enjoy this level of commercial success.
reators the BBC spoke to recall how Nijisanji - a popular VTuber agency based in Japan - announced its India branch in 2019 and launched three VTubers, including Noor, who raked up more than 60,000 subscribers - only to suspend operations in 2021. Observers speculate this was due to ""failed marketing"". AnyColor Inc, the entertainment start-up which owns Nijisanji, declined to answer the BBC's questions.
Most Indian VTubers start out on YouTube but are now active on streaming platforms like Twitch as well. Their videos rarely cross 1,000 views on YouTube and the creators work independently. But experts in the space say that the niche is slowly expanding.
Project Starscape has launched two batches - popularly called ""gens"" - of VTubers so far. The agency held auditions to shortlist candidates and helped them set up their YouTube channels.
""We received a total of around 260 applications,"" says Mr Joshi. So far, the company's VTubers are all women but he says he plans to launch a batch of all-male VTubers soon.
""Female VTubers tend to do better because gaming has a majority male fan base,"" says Mr Joshi, adding that he has just closed an angel round of funding with a Japanese investor.
An introductory video by Zucci Agasura, one of the agency's VTubers, has 52,000 views on YouTube. ""Depending on your engagement, you can earn money through YouTube's Channel Membership - where fans pay for access to exclusive perks and content,"" says the creator, but declines to divulge more details about her earnings from the platform.  
Last year, the 25-year-old creator behind VTuber MeowCatMax founded Virtualism - a company that offers a platform for upcoming VTubers to showcase their skills and build their fanbase.
""We put out news, podcasts and are also conducting auditions to launch our first gen of VTubers,"" he says.
Harsh, who maintains a page for the Indian VTubing community on Reddit - a social news aggregation and discussion website - says that Indian VTubers haven't gained traction yet because ""the concept of living for your hobbies is still budding here"".
But he remains a huge fan. ""Watching a VTuber is like watching a friend and when VTubers collaborate, it can feel like watching a reality show."""	/news/world-asia-india-63298243
health	John Radcliffe Hospital: Patients using A&E hits record high	"umber of people being treated or waiting for treatment at a major hospital's A&E department has hit a record high. 
Lily O'Connor, Oxfordshire's urgent care director, said 157 patients were in the John Radcliffe Hospital's emergency department in Oxford on Monday evening. 
She said despite the ""unprecedented"" demand staff had coped well.
But they were working under ""persistent pressure"", she added. 
While she said demand ""fluctuates"" at the county's other hospital, the Horton General in Banbury, staff at the A&E there have regularly been placed ""under significant pressure"" over recent months. 
John Radcliffe has been ""under significant pressure since August"" across all ages, and demand for children's services has got ""particularly bad"" over recent weeks.   
""When we hit 100 [patients] it's pretty tough on everybody because we have got a large volume of people to see at a single point in time and [are] trying to ensure that everyone who needs immediate care gets it. 
""To get 157 in the early evening [on Monday] was unprecedented at the John Radcliffe,"" Ms O'Connor told BBC Radio Oxford.
Care Quality Commission said last month that the health and care system across England is gridlocked because patients cannot access the support they need. 
Its annual report said the problem was resulting in long waits for ambulances and in A&E departments. 
Pete Macgrane, Oxford Health's clinical director for community services, said that trust is also seeing increased demand. 
""Everything that we are doing is trying to make sure that we can support patients where at all possible and where it's clinically the right thing to do to remain within their own homes,"" he said.

sports	Amir Albazi: Iraqi MMA fighter dreams of becoming first Arab UFC champion	"Amir Albazi's journey to become the first Iraqi man fighting for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) may have been tougher than any of his bouts to date.
rising talent in professional mixed martial arts (MMA) was born in Baghdad but grew up in Sweden, after his family fled Iraq to escape Saddam Hussein's authoritarian regime.
Albazi arrived in the Nordic country as a boy who could not speak a word of Swedish - and he experienced severe culture shock in his new surroundings.
""In school, I couldn't understand what people were saying, but I could tell they were making fun of me,"" he told the BBC. 
""The only way I could express myself was with my fists.""
29-year-old said his world was transformed when, by chance, he found MMA on TV. It was love at first sight.
MMA combines techniques from different disciplines of martial arts, including kickboxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing and wrestling.
rt was conceived in the early 1990s as a way to find the best combat style. It now boasts millions of fans worldwide, and the UFC is its biggest promoter.
Albazi immediately sought the nearest gym in Stockholm where he could learn the sport.
At the time, MMA was viewed as too brutal for adolescents, so the young refugee could only train in jiu-jitsu, a martial art based on ground fighting and submission holds.
rt gave him confidence and steered him away from the troubles that surrounded him in the tough Stockholm suburb of Bredang.
He won several major jiu-jitsu titles as a teenager and travelled around Europe for MMA bouts, lying about his age so he would be let into the cage.
He moved to London to study sports science and then relocated to Las Vegas, where the UFC is based.
As a professional, Albazi is known by his ring name, ""The Prince"" - a translation of his Arabic first name.
He now has almost 15 years of experience in the sport and wants to become the first Iraqi and Arab champion in the UFC's history. 
""I feel a great responsibility on my shoulders being the only Iraqi in the UFC. I feel as if I am representing my country and the whole Arab world,"" he said.
Albazi competes in the flyweight weight category (53-57kg; 116-125lbs) and boasts an impressive record of 15 wins and only one loss, with the majority of his victories coming by way of choke holds.
He will next appear in the ring in Las Vegas on 17 December to face Alessandro Costa of Brazil.
""My plan is the same as always. I will take him down, wear him out and get the choke,"" he said.
Albazi explained that he eventually plans to return to Iraq and develop MMA there.
""All Iraqis are champions at heart, so it will come naturally for them. All they need is the support and facilities to train,"" he said.
Following his last UFC win, Albazi met with the spokesman of the Iraqi military to discuss ways to evolve the sport.
His dream is to inspire a generation of young athletes in the Arab world - just as the Russian fighter Khabib Nurmagomedov and the Cameroonian star Francis Ngannou have done elsewhere.
Despite growing up abroad, Albazi has remained close to his culture, and always enters fights with the Iraqi flag draped over his shoulders.
""Many Arabs in the West shy away from their heritage, but it should be the opposite,"" he said. ""Arab traditions and values make me who I am and give me strength.""
In a recent documentary, he extolled the health benefits of pacha, a traditional dish made from slow-boiled sheep heads and other innards.
Albazi credits much of his success to his Islamic faith.
""I have seen many of the top fighters stressed before they fight. Because of my belief in God I always remain calm. I know everything has been written for me,"" he said.
But his work ethic also helps him excel, he said. ""My whole career if people did 10 reps, I would stay after training and do extra,"" he said.

World Without And The World Within, Sunday Talks With My Children by Nathan Coley has been installed in Cutlog Vennel. 
Perth and Kinross Council said the cost of the artwork and its installation was approximately £115,000 and came from its lighting strategy capital budget. 
uncil said the artwork runs on electricity and has a daily running cost of about 80p, or £292 a year.
It is currently lit from 07:00 until 02:00, but the times will change as light levels change with the season, the council added.
It is part of the council's ambition to create a permanent light art trail within the city centre. 
words in the artwork reference a quote from Sir Patrick Geddes, a Scottish polymath perhaps best known as a town planner. 
Artist Nathan Coley said: ""I'm delighted to be launching a new permanent sculpture in Perth - a city geographically and historically in the centre of Scotland, now the home to a new illuminated text work with the word 'world' in the middle.
""It's an ambitious new sculpture that places Perth in the centre of Scotland and illuminates the city-centre with ideas and thoughts of our public and private self.
""Patrick Geddes attended Perth Academy, and I'm sure he would been delighted and intrigued to find me appropriating his words to this end.""
Mr Coley is from Glasgow and he was nominated for a Turner Prize in 2007. 
Nick Williams, chief executive of Horsecross Arts, which runs Perth Concert Hall and Theatre said: ""Sharing a wall with our Victorian auditorium, Cutlog Vennel has a long and historic association with Perth Theatre.
""The words are particularly appropriate - we hear tales of years past when locals without tickets would hold glasses up against the wall to try to hear what was happening in the theatre. 
""Illuminating the vennel with such an impactful artwork gives it some much-deserved profile in the city. We're delighted to be involved in the project.""
A spokeswoman for Perth and Kinross Council said very low energy bulbs have been used in the artwork. 
""This is a significant piece by an important Scottish artist that adds to the cultural offer in Perth and will do so for many years to come,"" she added. "	/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-63205802
business	Mortgage rate rises set to put pressure on house prices, says Halifax	"UK's housing market is showing signs of slowing and rising interest rates are set to exert ""significant downward pressure"" on prices in the months ahead, the Halifax has said.
mortgage lender said house prices had been ""largely flat"" since June.
Prices rose at an annual rate of 9.9% in September, the Halifax said, the slowest rate since January.
Interest rates on typical two- and five-year fixed rate mortgages hit their highest for a decade this week.
And on Friday they rose further still. The rate on a typical two-year fixed rate mortgage hit 6.16%, according to Moneyfacts, the highest for 14 years.
rate on a typical five-year fixed rate mortgage deal has also topped 6% this week for the first time in 12 years, with the rate now at 6.07%.
Mortgage rates have been rising for months but saw a sharp increase following the mini-budget last month.
Uncertainty over future interest rates after the mini-budget also led lenders to pull more than a thousand mortgage deals from the market.
Halifax said that house prices dipped slightly in September, falling 0.1% from the month before, with the typical UK property now costing £293,835.
Kim Kinnaird, director at Halifax Mortgages, said that even before the fallout from the mini-budget, its figures suggested that the housing market ""may have already entered a more sustained period of slower growth"". 
""Predicting what happens next means making sense of the many variables now at play, and the housing market has consistently defied expectations in recent times,"" she added.
""While stamp duty cuts, the short supply of homes for sale and a strong labour market all support house prices, the prospect of interest rates continuing to rise sharply amid the cost of living squeeze, plus the impact in recent weeks of higher mortgage borrowing costs on affordability, are likely to exert more significant downward pressure on house prices in the months ahead.""
Earlier this week, the Halifax, which is UK's biggest mortgage lender, raised its rates on a range of deals for new borrowers to well over 5%.
On Thursday, the bosses of major UK banks met the Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, and the latest developments in the mortgage market were discussed.
It was reported that the chancellor is considering extending the mortgage guarantee scheme beyond December, when it is due to end, after banks raised this at Thursday's meeting.
me - which was launched in April 2021 during Covid - is designed to help people get on the property ladder, as it allows homebuyers to buy a property with only a 5% deposit.
It is available to anyone buying a home costing up to £600,000, unless they are buy-to-let or second homes.
Under the scheme, the government offers a partial guarantee, generally of 15%, to compensate lenders if the borrower defaults on repayments."	/news/business-63170108
politics	Prince of Wales has no plans for investiture, Kensington Palace confirms	"Prince of Wales has no plans for an investiture, Kensington Palace has said.
William made his first visit on Wednesday to the Welsh Parliament since his father made him Prince of Wales.
King's decision triggered a debate about whether or not there should be a repeat of Charles' 1969 investiture in Caernarfon.
While there was support for that event at the time, it also faced protests.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said it ""easy to see"" why a different approach was being taken ""during tough times"".
Meanwhile the prince said he is supporting both England and Wales at the World Cup, following controversy over his support for the former.
Deputy presiding officer David Rees said William accepted a Welsh bucket hat during the visit.
William met the First Minister Mark Drakeford, Presiding Officer Elin Jones and party leaders.
He arrived at the Senedd by car and entered through a side-entrance for the meeting in Cardiff, which is free of the pomp or crowds of recent royal events in the capital.
Prince of Wales was given his title by the new King the day following the death of Queen Elizabeth II.
It was William's second official visit to the country as Prince of Wales, after he and the Princess of Wales visited Anglesey and Swansea in September.
role of Prince of Wales has faced criticism - the Plaid Cymru Senedd group said the title of has ""no formal place or responsibility within Welsh life"", following their meeting with the royal.
But the visit was welcomed by the Welsh Conservatives.
Kensington Palace said the meeting aimed to ""deepen his understand of the issues and opportunities of greatest importance to the Welsh people"".
BBC Wales was told that the prince understands he is at the start of a long period of association with Wales' political system, and was keen to express his desire to deepen the trust and respect of people of Wales over time.
He planned to tell them that there are no formal plans for an investiture ceremony, aware of the political controversy that surrounded the event in 1969.
Kensington Palace said an investiture is ""not on the table"".
ure ceremony for the then-Prince of Wales took place in Caernarfon Castle in 1969
On Wednesday the prince was given a brief tour of the Senedd building and debating chamber led by the Llywydd, Elin Jones.
He met politicians from the four parties represented in the Senedd - Welsh Labour, the Welsh Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Liberal Democrats.
William concluded his visit by meeting the Welsh Youth Parliament.
meeting follows controversy about his support for the English football team, ahead of the World Cup.
On Tuesday evening, Welsh actor Michael Sheen questioned whether William's role as Prince of Wales was appropriate given his support of the England football team.
Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru MS, said on Twitter: ""He's an Englishman, so of course he supports England,"" but added: ""I'm clear there shouldn't be a Prince of Wales. But this football thing must be embarrassing for him too. Just highlights the nonsense.""
After Elin Jones raised the World Cup group match between Wales and England, he said: ""I'm telling everyone I'm supporting both, definitely. I can't lose.
""I've supported England since I've been quite small, but I support Welsh rugby and that's my kind of way of doing it.
""I happily support Wales over England in the rugby.
""I've got to be able to play carefully with my affiliations because I worry otherwise if I suddenly drop England to support Wales then that doesn't look right for the sport either. So I can't do that.""
Prince Charles, as he was then, was 20 when he was crowned at the investiture ceremony at Caernarfon Castle.
While it had no formal constitutional role, the ceremony presented Charles with the symbols that marked him as Prince of Wales: the sword, coronet, ring, rod and mantle.
In addition to the 4000 guests present in the castle, 19 million saw it at home and another 500 million watched around the world.
was watched by a TV audience of millions. Street parties were held across the country, but it polarised opinion in Wales amid a backdrop of protests and bombings.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""I think it's a decision for him to make. He will have thought carefully about it. I always believed myself that taking 1969 as a template for Wales in 2022 would not be a reliable guide to the best way to proceed."" 
""In tough times, I think everybody who is in a position of making decisions about how public money is spent, and the sort of messages that it sends to the wider population, will be thinking hard about that and I think it's very easy to see why the prince himself, and those who advise him, will come to the conclusion that a different approach is the right one to take in 2022.""  
King Charles' decision to make William Prince of Wales triggered discussion among some politicians over whether an investiture would be suitable.
But in a Walesonline article, written in October, the presiding officer said investitures ""should be consigned"" to the 20th century.
Plaid Cymru MS Elin Jones, who is among those meeting William on Wednesday, wrote her republicanism remained ""unshaken"" following her involvement in the events marking the death of Queen Elizabeth at the Senedd and at St James' Palace, for the Accession Council.
In September Kensington Palace said there were no plans for Prince William to have an investiture ""anything like his father had"" as Prince of Wales.
Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price were among those who met William on Wednesday.
Mr Davies said it was a ""pleasure to welcome the Prince of Wales"".
He added: ""After the King and Queen's recent visit, it is fantastic to see the bonds between Wales and our Royal Family becoming stronger still. There is a huge amount of goodwill towards the Prince and Princess in Wales, and I know there will always be a warm welcome for them whenever they visit.
A spokesperson on behalf of the Plaid Cymru group said: ""The Plaid Cymru group have been clear that we believe the title of the ""Prince of Wales"" to be antiquated and out of touch with a modern, equal, and democratic Wales.""
""Furthermore, given the exacerbating cost of living crisis and the historical sensitives, an investiture should not take place in any circumstance - nor should any service that could be interpreted as a lesser form of an investiture,"" the group said.
It added: ""We look forward to seeing the Prince use the platform he has already, that isn't necessarily reliant on him being Prince of Wales, to promote good causes and positive change across Wales and the world including tackling child poverty, inequality, and the climate crisis.""
Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds, said: ""It was an honour to welcome His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to the Senedd this morning and I am extremely grateful for him taking the time to have a one-on-one meeting with me.
""It is very clear that His Royal Highness cares deeply about the people of Wales and it was fantastic to hear of his commitment to mental health causes, particularly his interest in mental health provisions for rural areas and farmers."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63635177
entertainment	Harry and Meghan: What to look out for in the Netflix series	"first three episodes of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's new documentary have dropped - they cover how Harry and Meghan met, their first dates, and include insights into their family life. Here are some of the moments to look out for.
After the dramatic opening credits and music, one of the first scenes in episode one shows Prince Harry filming himself inside the VIP Windsor Suite at London's Heathrow airport. He is waiting to board a flight to Canada. 
It's March 2020. The Queen had agreed that her grandson and his wife could stand down from their roles as senior royals, and Harry has just finished his last stint of engagements. It's a personal and pivotal moment - and it's the first time we've seen it.
""What on earth happened? How did we end up here?"" Harry says. 
Footage of newspaper front pages expressing shock at the couple's dramatic decision to resign from the institution then cuts to Vancouver Island in Canada, where Meghan is filming herself on a mobile phone, with a towel wrapped around her hair.
""H is in London, and I'm here,"" Meghan says, shaking her head. ""I don't even know where to begin."" 
Later in episode one we get an intimate look into the Sussexes family life at their home in California. As a vivid red sunset appears across the screen, we hear Meghan asking her eldest child, Archie, how he would describe it. 
""Well, it's all done beautiful,"" the toddler, now aged three, responds. 
udio is accompanied by footage - filmed by Meghan on her mobile phone - of Archie toddling down a path outside their Montecito home, while Harry pushes a pram, in which we assume is daughter, Lilibet.
Episode one also sees Harry and Meghan set out how their romance began, in 2016. The pair had only met twice before when Prince Harry invited Meghan to join him on a five-day trip to Botswana. They slept in a tent with no access to a bathroom, no mirrors, and no mobile phone reception.
""I'm getting on the plane and going to the middle of the bush? What am I doing?"" Meghan says. ""What if we don't like each other?"" 
Meghan admits things felt a little awkward when she first arrived. ""I remember he handed me a chicken sandwich,"" she says, laughing. ""Thankfully we really liked each other.""
It doesn't take long to realise that while they might be the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to you and I, much like any other couple, Harry and Meghan have pet names for one another.  
And there seem to be a lot of them. She's M, Meg and Meghan, while he's H. At one point the camera shows Harry FaceTiming Meghan, and his name appears to be saved on her phone as Haz.
Episode two focusses on Meghan and her childhood and she talks candidly about both racism and being mixed race. ""People don't talk about what it's like to be mixed race. So much of my self-identification was trying to figure out where I fit in. And I think a lot of that is, you're not white enough or you're not black enough. But I don't see the world that way.""
Meghan is seen driving past the Hollywood Bowl, in Los Angeles, and talks about the last concert she went to there with her mum. 
As they were exiting the car park after the show, Meghan remembers her mother impatiently honking her horn at someone blocking their way. 
""And the woman turned around and screamed the N-word at my mom,"" Meghan says.
Her mother gripped the steering wheel so tightly her knuckles turned white, Meghan says. 
""She was just silent the rest of the drive home, we never talked about it."" 
In the same episode, Harry says that although he thought he ""had an awareness"" of racist issues, his relationship with Meghan has made him realise he's been ""blissfully sleepwalking through life"". 
""My children are mixed race and I'm really proud of that,"" he says.
In episode two, Meghan also recalls the first time she met other senior Royals and admits she hadn't anticipated the levels of formality that would be required - even behind closed doors.
She says she was barefoot and wearing ripped jeans when Prince William and his wife, Catherine, came over for dinner - and she went in for a hug. 
""I have always been a hugger,"" Meghan says, ""I didn't realise that that was jarring for a lot of Brits.""
Later, she describes the moment Harry asked if she knew how to curtsy, moments before her ""surreal"" first meeting with her boyfriend's grandmother - the late Queen.
""I just thought that was a joke,"" Meghan says. ""It was so intense.""
When the Queen left the room, Meghan was congratulated by Princess Eugenie and her mother, Sarah, Duchess of York. 
""I didn't know what I was doing,"" Meghan admits.
In the same episode, Harry describes when he proposed to Meghan. It was late 2017 and Meghan had been roasting a chicken at their home, when Harry decided to open a bottle of champagne. 
Having already asked for his grandmother's permission, Harry then got down on one knee to pop the question in the gardens of Kensington Palace, surrounded by 15 electric candles.
Although an official announcement would not be made for some weeks, the couple had an engagement party for friends at which all the guests dressed in animal costumes.
""Meghan and Harry were in matching penguin onesies - because penguins mate for life,"" their friend, Lucy Fraser, recalls. ""They were so sweet."" 
While the Queen was famous for her colourful, co-ordinated outfits, in episode three, Meghan explains why she was often seen dressed in muted tones - including white and beige - while in the UK.
""You can't ever wear the same colour as Her Majesty,"" she explains, ""but then you also shouldn't be wearing the same colour as one of the more senior members of the family.""
She says she did everything she could ""to blend in"".
""I don't want to embarrass the family,"" she adds."	/news/uk-63902533

EU Scrutiny Committee said full application EU rules would leave potentially half of all veterinary medicines facing discontinuation.
But the government said that while talks on the protocol continue, it does not intend to apply the EU regulations. 
rotocol means Northern Ireland is still inside the EU's pharmaceutical regulatory system.
However, it gets most of its medicines from Great Britain, which is not.
Earlier this year the EU changed its laws in an effort to help guarantee supplies of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, but that arrangement does not cover veterinary medicines.

entertainment	Eurovision 2023: Liverpool honour bittersweet, says Lord Mayor	"Liverpool will host Eurovision on behalf of Ukraine
Lord Mayor of Liverpool said winning Eurovision was ""bittersweet"" and vowed to do his utmost to honour the Ukrainian sister city.
Councillor Roy Gladden has written to the Mayor of Odesa after Liverpool secured the right to host the 2023 European Song Contest last week.
won a competition to hold the event after it was decided last year's winner Ukraine was unable to host.
He said it will celebrate Ukraine's culture with a ""scouse twist"".
It comes as BBC director general Tim Davie praised Liverpool for its ""energy"" and ""warmth"" and ""record of delivering great events"", after meeting the city's culture team to discuss the forthcoming show.
Ukraine's entrant Kalush Orchestra won May's contest and the winning country normally hosts the following year's contest.
However, the event will not be staged in the country because of the war in Ukraine, so Sam Ryder's second-placed finish led the UK to step in.
In his letter to Mayor of Odesa Gennadiy Trukhanov, the Lord Mayor of Liverpool said he was ""proud"" the city would host in Ukraine's place on 13 May, reported the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
""When it was announced that we were the winner, it was a bittersweet moment.
""We know this is your event - it should be you and your colleagues across your country working together on plans to host the competition in 2023 - but sadly that is not to be. 
""Ukraine is at the heart of our Eurovision plans - we will do our utmost to celebrate your culture, your people and your country - giving it a scouse twist which we're sure you'll approve of.""
Mr Davie said it was a ""real honour"" and ""joyous"" for Liverpool to be able to stage the contest on behalf of Ukraine. 
""Liverpool has a great record of delivering great events,"" he told BBC Radio Merseyside.
""There is a soul to this place; the history of this place; the energy.
""This is going to be a properly integrated production where we are doing real justice to Ukrainian culture,"" he added.
""Warmth comes up a lot when you are talking about Liverpool and there is that sense of bringing people together and boy do we need it; these are not easy times.
""Being part of something that brings us close to Ukraine is very, very important to this event,"" he added.
During the bidding process, Odesa and its mayor gave their full backing to Liverpool, saying it ""perfectly reflects the brightness of the event and demonstrates the true diversity within unity,"" adding: ""Let the songs of the entire Europe ring over the River Mersey."" 
Liverpool first struck up links with Odesa in 1957 when it was still part of the Soviet Union. 
City officials maintained an active policy of twinning with other cities following World War Two where links were forged with the Black Sea port.

politics	Matt Hancock suspended as Tory MP for joining I'm a Celeb cast	"Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been suspended as a Conservative MP after joining the cast of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!
Mr Hancock will swap representing his constituents at Westminster for eating bugs in the jungle in Australia.
But Tory party managers have taken a dim view of the West Suffolk MP's decision to take part in a reality TV show while Parliament is sitting. 
ry chief whip said it was ""serious enough"" to warrant suspension. 
Simon Hart, who is in charge of Tory MP discipline, said he had taken the decision after speaking to Mr Hancock.
Andy Drummond, deputy chairman of the West Suffolk Conservative Association, said he was looking forward to seeing Mr Hancock ""eating a kangaroo's penis"".
mpaign group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice called Mr Hancock's decision ""sickening"", and called for ITV to remove him from the programme.
group tweeted: ""Matt Hancock isn't a 'celebrity', he's the former health secretary who oversaw the UK having one of the highest death tolls in the world from Covid-19 whilst breaking his own lockdown rules.""
Rishi Sunak's official spokesman said: ""The PM believes that at a challenging time for the country, MPs should be working hard for their constituents, whether that is in the House or in their constituency.""
kesman said it was ""unlikely"" Mr Sunak would be watching the programme.
When MPs have the whip suspended, they are kicked out of the party within Parliament but remain an MP and continue to be paid.
Conservative MP Tim Loughton said Mr Hancock had been an ""absolute prat"" and losing the Tory whip was ""the least he deserves"".
""I'm completely disappointed and disgusted that he's put himself and his so-called celebrity career ahead of serving his constituents,"" he told Times Radio.
He added that if Mr Hancock's local Conservative association ""have got any sense they might deselect him as well"" - a move that would prevent him standing as a Tory candidate at the next election.
Some West Suffolk constituents told the BBC they thought Mr Hancock should be focusing on local issues, not jetting across the world for a reality show.
One said it was a shame he thought it was a better use of time than serving his constituents, while another objected to him going to the jungle as bills go up, people are losing jobs and there's not enough money.
Kezia Dugdale, who was a member of the Scottish parliament when she went into the jungle in 2017, warned it was a risky decision for Mr Hancock but could be empowering and comforting to lots of people if he talks about his own dyslexia.
Sources close to Mr Hancock said: ""Matt doesn't expect to serve in government again, so it's an incredible opportunity for him to engage with the 12 million Brits who tune in every single night.
""Matt has told the whips in Parliament and he will use his time in the jungle to promote his dyslexia campaign.""
He will be a late addition to the ITV show, which returns to Australia this year and will star Euro 2022 winner Jill Scott, ex-rugby star Mike Tindall and singer Boy George, among others.
BBC understands Mr Hancock has been working on several reality TV projects in recent months. 
MPs are paid a salary of £84,144 but they're effectively self-employed and allowed to do paid work beyond their role as an elected representative.
Consultancy and legal work can bring in significant sums for some, but reality TV is not unheard of as a sideline for those keen to boost their profile.  
Matt Hancock will have to disclose his earnings from I'm a Celebrity..., some of which he's said he'll donate to charity.  
Since resigning as health secretary he's made several attempts to reboot his political career - but now seems to have accepted he's unlikely to return to government in the near future and may have an eye on life beyond parliament.  
His decision to enter the ITV jungle has mainly attracted criticism and ridicule. 
But it's ensured one thing: lots of people are talking about Matt Hancock. 
former health secretary joins a long list of politicians to have braved the Bushtucker Trial, including former Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries.
Ms Dorries, who was the first celebrity to be eliminated in the 2012 series, tweeted: ""At least he doesn't have to worry about George Osborne in No 10 waiting to remove his whip when he gets back!""
She had the whip suspended for six months after failing to notify party bosses she was appearing.
Former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik and the former leader of the Scottish Labour Party Kezia Dugdale have also made appearances in the jungle-set reality contest.

He had been running to chair the powerful House of Commons Treasury committee, but dropped out of the race on Monday.
Liberal Democrats are calling for Mr Hancock to ""forego his MP's salary for the duration"" of his time on I'm a Celebrity.
Labour MP Chris Bryant, who chairs the Commons standards committee, has gone further, calling for Mr Hancock to face a by-election. He called Mr Hancock's decision ""deeply unpleasant"".

politics	Teachers' union 'hopeful' of new offer to avert strike	"EIS general secretary said they are hopeful of a new pay offer.
Scotland's largest teaching union is confident a new pay offer will be made to avert a teacher's strike on Thursday but is still preparing to take action that will close most schools.
rs across the country are due to stage a 24-hour walkout after rejecting a 5% pay increase, calling for 10%.
EIS general secretary Andrea Bradley said the union was ""hopeful"" of a new offer and was prepared to negotiate.
""We are ready to consider a new offer as soon as it comes to us,"" she said.
Deputy First Minister John Swinney previously said there was no more money to fund public sector pay rises.
It followed Scotland's largest nursing union voting to go on strike for the first time ever in a dispute over pay.
Further EIS strike dates have been set for 10 January in primary schools and 11 January in secondary schools. The Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association (SSTA) is also considering taking strike action in the week beginning 5 December.
Ms Bradley told BBC Scotland's Sunday Show she was very hopeful there would be a new offer having been in informal discussions with the Scottish government.
But she said that as things stood, there had not been any new offer since the previous one was rejected in September so the strike would be going ahead as planned.
""As things stand, the EIS continues to plan for a day of national strike action on Thursday which is likely to close almost all schools in Scotland,"" she said.
""We are hopeful however, that over the course of this weekend Scottish government and Cosla colleagues will have been able to have arrived at an agreement around a more substantial offer than the 5% that was rejected in the the middle of September.
""We are ready to consider a new offer as soon as it comes to us at the beginning of the working work.""
Ms Bradley said the union's salaries committee had scheduled a meeting for Tuesday and another meeting of its executive committee planned for Wednesday.
""So we are more than ready to consider any offer that comes forward from the Scottish government and Cosla over the course of the next couple of days,"" she said.
""Of course we are prepared to negotiate. We have been negotiating around this since April.""
She pointed out that when the EIS claim for a 10% increase was lodged, inflation was at 7% but was now at 11.1%.
""So a 10% pay award would be a 1.1% real terms pay cut and that's against the backdrop of teachers salaries being eroded to the tune of 25% since 2008,"" she said.
She told the programme the union would not like to see any cuts to the education budget.
""Should that occur the responsibility for that will very much lie with the Scottish government, not with teachers and not with the EIS who are quite rightly looking to protect the living standards of teachers as hard-working public sector workers,"" she said.
""When you underfund education it is ultimately the children and young people who will be disadvantaged.""
She said that as teachers had not received any pay increase yet they were struggling to meet the cost of food, fuel, energy and housing and some members were now using food banks.
John Swinney announced £615m of spending cuts in his emergency budget review earlier this month.
It came on top of £560m cuts to public services in September.
Ms Bradley said the EIS understood the position the Scottish government was in but said it had known well in advance that there was going to be a substantial teacher pay claim coming this year.
""They knew to expect this and yet they haven't planned adequately for it so the responsibility rests with the Scottish government,"" she said.
Scottish government has said it is  ""committed to supporting a fair pay offer"" through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers - the body that negotiates pay and conditions of service.
Education Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ""We are absolutely committed to supporting a fair pay offer for teachers through the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers, the body that negotiates their pay and conditions of service.
""I spoke to trades union representatives on Friday and restated that I am keen to work with Cosla, as the employers, to allow them to make a revised pay offer and avoid unnecessary strikes.
""I have been clear, however, that the Scottish government has a fixed budget and if we are looking to fund public sector pay offers, then that money must come from somewhere else in the budget.""
Scottish Conservatives education spokesman Stephen Kerr said: ""Teachers are clearly sending out a message that the SNP have failed to prepare, and now they are preparing to fail as strikes will shut nearly every school in Scotland on Thursday.
""Our young pupils suffered enough disruption during the pandemic and missing out on more classroom time is the last thing they need. The buck for this imminent strike action stops with the SNP government.
""They claim education is their top priority but have failed to address these threats with any sort of urgency. There is still time for Shirley-Anne Somerville to show some leadership, get back round the table with the unions, and avoid the school gates being closed this week which will cause huge disruption across the country.""
Scottish Liberal Democrats education spokesman Willie Rennie said: ""There is no doubt that these strikes will be hugely disruptive but teachers can only be pushed so far.
""Shirley-Anne Somerville should have been front and centre for months hammering out a deal between educational authorities and teachers. Instead, she hides away in St Andrews House and blames everyone but herself for these strikes.""
""A pay deal needs to be reached in the next few days. If these strikes go ahead she will owe parents, teachers and pupils a public apology.""
EIS said 96% of its members backed a teachers' strike on a 71% turnout.
rospect of the teachers' strike on Thursday will revive memories of the long-running programme of industrial action in the 1980s.
wo main teachers' unions - the EIS and the SSTA - were involved in a pay dispute which lasted for two years and which often seemed like a war of attrition between the unions and the Conservative government of the time. 
Across Scotland, this dispute is often remembered because of the devastating impact a work-to-rule had on school sport. 
But for some young people at the time, the impact was much more severe. As well as a few national strikes, there was a rolling programme of action targeted at secondary schools in the constituencies of government ministers.
regular strikes at schools in some Conservative constituencies had a huge effect on the education of some young people and the school community.
EIS members at some schools went on strike regularly on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.
It is perhaps impossible to truly quantify the impact of these regular strikes on some students - some may even have failed exams because of lost teaching time.
Each side was acutely aware of the impact the action was having on young people and tended to blame the other for it.
memory of this lengthy dispute - and its impact on some schools and young people - is one reason why many teachers still regard striking as a nuclear option and hope the mere threat of action now will be sufficient. "	/news/uk-scotland-63694057
technology	Ethereum change cut cryptocurrency power demand	"A change in the way the cryptocurrency Ethereum works may have cut its power consumption by country-sized amounts.
mount of electricity saved is similar to that used by Ireland or even Austria, work published in the data-science journal Patterns suggests.
Bitcoin, the largest crypto, is thought to use more electricity than Finland.
It has even been suggested emissions from Bitcoin could exceed the global savings currently made by driving electric vehicles, the article notes.
Like all cryptocurrencies, Ethereum relies on a blockchain, a giant, constantly updating database, logging every transaction.
Previously, this was maintained and verified by a system called Proof of Work, used by many cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.
Companies and volunteers whose computers helped to run the network were rewarded with new cryptocurrency coins. 
more work they completed, the greater the chance of creating new coins.
uraged businesses to set up massive warehouses of computers running 24-7, often on energy derived from fossil fuels, the article suggests. 
But on 15 September, in an event known as The Merge, Ethereum switched to a system called Proof of Stake, where the chance of creating a new coin no longer depends on the amount of computing work completed.
mplexity of the switch was compared to rebuilding a skyscraper's foundations while it remained standing.
But it cut Ethereum's electrical energy consumption by at least 99.84%, the peer-reviewed ""perspective"" article suggests.
How cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin work
Ethereum blockchain also supports hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of other coins and crypto products such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
But the paper's author, Alex De Vries, a data-science and economics researcher at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, warns the computers may simply have switched to creating other cryptocurrencies.
In September 2022, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy said legal limits on energy-intensive cryptocurrency mining should be considered.
Mr De Vries said: ""The Bitcoin community has been very anti-change - but the Ethereum community has shown that despite concerns and resistance, it is possible to make the necessary changes on a live blockchain, which means that the Bitcoin community may need a little bit of a nudge from the outside to actually make things happen.""
Gavin Brown an associate professor at the University of Liverpool, told BBC News: ""Sustainability is an essential problem to resolve in the crypto space. To achieve this, the prospect of new regulation is an important lever.""
But it was in the interests of for Bitcoin and Ethereum enthusiasts to clean up their own act to attract money from institutional investors such as banks or pension funds.
""Much of that money may presently want to invest in crypto but is unable to do so until or unless crypto becomes more sustainable,"" he said.
And Mr De Vries warned it would be premature for the Ethereum community to declare a ""complete victory"" over the environmental concerns facing crypto assets ""as the blockchain-based system remains relatively inefficient compared to more centralised alternatives""."	/news/technology-63872983

sports	Winter Olympics: What now for Russia's Kamila Valieva after failed drugs test?	"If Kamila Valieva wins Olympic gold this week, there will be no medal ceremony, no anthem and no flag.
what happens when an athlete who has failed a drugs test is allowed to compete at a Games where her country is already banned for a doping scandal.
medal is on hold until a decision has been made on Valieva - before she has even competed.
Alongside the outrage and the questions about who is responsible for the fact a 15-year-old Russian figure skater has tested positive for a banned substance are those who are disappointed and disillusioned by the processes that have led to this scenario.
So, how did we get to this point?
When the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) received word on 8 February that Valieva had failed a drugs test, it provisionally suspended her in line with Wada rules.
Valieva appealed against the decision - on what grounds, it is so far unclear - and Rusada agreed to lift the suspension the following day.
International Olympic Committee (IOC), World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and the International Skating Union (ISU) then launched an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) to get the provisional ban re-imposed.
Cas hearing was only ever about the provisional ban - it was not considering the positive test or the circumstances around it.
It decided that because of Valieva's age and the ""untimely notification of the results"" of the failed test - in the middle of the Games and nearly six weeks after she gave the sample - that it would do her ""irreparable harm"" if she were not allowed to compete.
So, she can take part in the women's event which starts on Tuesday and which she is favourite to win.
But the issue of the failed drugs test will still need to be resolved and no time frame has been given for this.
Under Wada rules, if an athlete's A sample is positive, then they may request that the B sample is tested. It is not yet known whether Valieva has asked for this.
Wada said it was ""disappointed"" by the ruling, saying it had appeared that Cas had not applied Wada's anti-doping code which does not allow for exceptions for minors in the case of mandatory provisional suspensions.
IOC, meanwhile, said it ""had to follow the rule of the law"" and ""will therefore have to allow"" her to compete.
It would be impossible not to hear the tone of reluctance in that statement.
It went further by saying there would be ""dignified medal ceremonies"" only once the anti-doping case was resolved if Valieva wins a medal, and it also said it was adding a 25th skater into Thursday's 24-woman free skate ""in case Ms Valieva is ranked in the first 24 of the short programme"".
Former skaters were among those to criticise the decision to let her complete, with 1998 Olympic champion Tara Lipinski saying: ""Regardless of age or timing of the test/results, I believe this will leave a permanent scar on our sport.""
And United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) chief executive Sarah Hirshland said athletes were being denied the right to know they are competing on a level playing field and former Wada director general David Howman said ""this is now embarrassing for all"".
Meanwhile, Russian Sports Minister Oleg Matytsin said it had been a ""right and fair decision"" to allow Valieva to carry on competing. 
""I consider it important that the Cas arbitrators showed integrity, professionalism and carefully considered all the circumstances of the case,"" he said.
Valieva arrived in Beijing as the bright, young talent who had been breaking world records ever since bursting on to the senior scene less than six months ago.
Last week she became the first female skater to land a quadruple jump at an Olympics - a rotation of four times in the air - and wowed the judges with the perfect package of incredible technical ability alongside beautiful artistry.
wo days later, she was a child who had failed a drugs test.
Under the spotlight of the world's media, she continued to train, sometimes looking tearful and embracing her coach Eteri Tutberidze, or hugging a soft toy.
Barely half an hour after the court ruling that settled her immediate Olympic fate, she was back on the ice to practise.
roughout the events of recent days, the central theme has been that at the heart of the matter is a child who needs protecting.
""We do not know how many tears and what moral strength this whole crazy situation has cost Kamila,"" the Russian Olympic Committee said. 
""To go out and train every day with a decision hanging over you, not knowing what will happen tomorrow... To force yourself to appear calm in public, allowing your feelings to show only when no-one is watching ... We don't know. It's very personal.""
Wada has said it will be investigating her entourage, including coaches, doctors and other adults surrounding her.
Before that, though, she will have to go out and compete under the spotlight not even knowing whether she will be given any medal she might win.
will take remarkable mental strength at any age. 
No matter how this case ends up being resolved, Russia has once again found itself associated with a story related to doping.
Already being sanctioned after an investigation found in 2016 it had run a state-sponsored doping programme for four years, any hint of another doping scandal further damages Russia's reputation. 
""This appears to be another chapter in the systematic and pervasive disregard for clean sport by Russia,"" USOPC chief Hirshland said.
United States Anti-Doping Agency chief executive Travis Tygart added: ""For the sixth consecutive Olympic Games, Russia has hijacked the competition and stolen the moment from clean athletes and the public.
""In addition to athletes and the public, this young athlete has been terribly let down by the Russians and the global anti-doping system that unfairly cast her into this chaos.""
Russia denies running a state-sponsored doping programme but has acknowledged some shortcomings in its implementation of anti-doping rules.
Its ban from international competition runs until December, but before these Games Wada president Witold Banka warned Russia it should not assume the sanctions would automatically be lifted at that time.
""At the end of the year we will need to say 'yes, Rusada can be compliant',"" he said. ""It is not the end of this process. It is too early to say definitely that they are compliant.""
Before the Games three Russian skaters, including Valieva, were tipped to sweep the podium in the women's event. 
If that happens when the event concludes on Thursday and there is no medal ceremony in one of the Winter Olympics' most prestigious events, there will be no starker reminder that this case is far from over."	/sport/winter-olympics/60372671
politics	Qatar World Cup: Welsh government boycotts Wales-Iran game	"A Welsh government minister who was expected to attend Wales' World Cup match with Iran will stay at home due to recent protests in the country. 
It was the only group match in Qatar Deputy Sport Minister Dawn Bowden was due to go to. 
First Minister Mark Drakeford and Economy Minister Vaughan Gething are still attending other World Cup ties.
Qatar has faced criticism in the build-up to the tournament for multiple human rights concerns. 
ude its laws against same-sex relationships, as well as how it treats women and foreign workers. 
Welsh government said it will still attend matches with the US and England, where they say ministers can ""share our interests and values""
BBC Wales was told the decision was due to the recent events in Iran and was not related to the wider debate about whether the entire visit to Qatar was appropriate.
Ms Bowden could attend future matches if Wales advance beyond the group stage, but it is not confirmed.
match against Iran is taking place at 10:00 GMT on 25 November in Al-Rayyan. 
Iran has been criticised internationally for its response to protests sparked by the death of a young woman arrested by the country's morality police.
Welsh government said: ""Welsh ministers will be attending the Wales games against the USA and England, as these represent the most significant opportunities for us to raise the profile of Wales and make connections where we can share our interests and values.
""Ministers will have a full programme of events and meetings to take advantage of this unique opportunity. 
""Welsh ministers will not be attending the Iran game and will be supporting Wales from home.""
Mr Drakeford is expected to attend the fixture against the US, while Mr Gething is planning to go to the England game.
Some gay Welsh fans have said they will stay away from the tournament, and earlier this week Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey criticised Mark Drakeford's decision to go to the tournament.. 
His comments sparked a robust Twitter response from Plaid Cymru MS and Senedd presiding officer Elin Jones, who said it was ""absolutely"" right for Mr Drakeford to attend.
""Our football team is there, so should he be. None of us wanted Qatar to host,"" she said.
As well as supporting Wales' first World Cup appearance since 1958, the Welsh government wants to use the event to raise the country's profile on the world stage.
Mr Drakeford's stance contradicts that of UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, who is boycotting the event.
In September, Mr Gething told the Senedd that he, Mr Drakeford and Ms Bowden would attend a ""range of events"", as well as ""each of Wales' group games against the USA, Iran and England"".
Asked if he had considered a boycott, he said: ""We've considered all options, but we think it's the right thing for ministers to go, to support our team, and to make the very best of the opportunity that it is, both in terms of what it does for Wales on the stage, but also in that positive point about projecting and being proud of our values today.""
On Thursday a senior Welsh Labour MP, Rhondda's Chris Bryant, retweeted a report extremely critical of the treatment of LGBT people in Qatar, said: ""This is why no UK officials should be going to the World Cup.""
He did not name any of the Welsh ministers attending.
One Labour politician told BBC Wales they thought Mr Drakeford should not be attending: ""But I get why he is going for Wales"".
But they criticised the planned attendance of two other ministers as a ""pointless waste of money"".
Another Labour elected politician said while as a football fan they were happy that Mr Drakeford was attending, as someone who cared about human rights they were not.
Some Labour backbench Senedd members defended the trip.
Hefin David, Caerphilly MS, said while the event should have never been held in Qatar ""there are good reasons for Wales' government"" to be at the tournament.
John Griffiths, MS for Newport East, said: ""This is an opportunity that might not come along again for some time.""
Welsh Conservative sport spokesman Tom Giffard said: ""The Labour party can't quite decide whether or not they are going to be attending the Qatar World Cup. The hypocrisy is clear for all to see.""
He added that he hoped Mr Drakeford would still go to Qatar: ""It is right however, that the Welsh team are fully supported in their first World Cup since the 1950s.""
Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: ""Iran's human rights record is atrocious and we welcome this [decision]. 
""However, Qatar's is equal as abysmal and the Welsh government shouldn't be sending any Ministers to Qatar itself."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63500563
business	Global firms are boosting baby formula supplies in the US	"Global firms are boosting supplies of baby formula in the US as the country grapples with a shortage.
Gerber-maker Nestle said it was flying additional shipments to the country from the Netherlands and Switzerland.
UK-based Reckitt Benckiser, which makes Enfamil and has factories in the US, has also said it has ramped up production by 30% this year.
move comes as US officials warned that resolution of the shortage remained months away.
On Monday, Abbott Laboratories, the biggest US supplier of powder infant formula brands such as Similac, reached a deal with regulators on steps needed to restart production at a key Michigan factory. It will take weeks for products to hit shelves after reopening, officials said.
Sturgis has been closed since February after bacteria was found in the facility, prompting recalls of several products.
utdown and recalls worsened a shortage that had been percolating for months due to supply chain and logistics delays and spiralled further after parents rushed to the stores to stock up.
White House has been under pressure to respond to the problem.
Worry and fear as baby formula shortage continues
On Monday, the US Food and Drug Administration said the US was working to address the issue, including easing rules to allow increased foreign shipments.
""With increased production by other manufacturers, forthcoming import actions and the potential for Abbott Nutrition's Sturgis facility to resume production in the near-term, the FDA expects supply to continue to improve over the next couple of months,"" it said. 
FDA said sales of infant formula rose 13% in April compared to January, before the recall, and some indicators suggested that the out-of-stock rates had been over-stated.
""Increased sales are a good indicator of formula available to the general population,"" it said."	/news/business-61484639
politics	UN expert warns men could 'abuse' Scottish gender reforms	"Scottish government's proposals to reform gender recognition laws could allow violent males to ""abuse"" the system, a UN expert claims. 
rganisation's special rapporteur on violence against women and girls said the legislation could increase potential safety risks.
Scottish ministers argue the current process to change a person's legal gender is too difficult and invasive. 
re is ""no evidence"" women and girls will be harmed by the bill.
A Scottish government spokesperson said many of the issues raised by the UN rapporteur have been addressed by parliament. 
Under the terms of the proposed new laws, people will no longer need a diagnosis of gender dysphoria to apply for a gender recognition certificate.
Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill will also reduce the time required for an applicant to live in their acquired gender. 
In a letter to the UK government, UN special rapporteur Reem Alsalem shared fears that the legislation ""would potentially open the door for violent males who identify as men to abuse the process of acquiring a gender certificate and the rights that are associated with it"".
She added: ""This presents potential risks to the safety of women in all their diversity (including women born female, transwomen, and gender non-conforming women).""
rapporteur's letter also argued that the proposals ""do not sufficiently take into consideration the specific needs of women and girls in all their diversity, particularly those at risk of male violence and those who have experienced male violence, as it does not provide for any safeguarding measures to ensure that the procedure is not, as far as can be reasonably assured, abused by sexual predators and other perpetrators of violence"".
She added: ""It is vital that service providers in Scotland continue to be able to provide both single-sex and gender-based services, and funding must be ring-fenced for a certain proportion to be single sex, balancing the needs of the different demographics without placing them in conflict.""
During stage two proceedings of the bill on Tuesday, MSPs approved an amendment which means the legislation has no impact on the Equality Act.
ws for exemptions to rules allowing trans people to access single-sex spaces such as domestic abuse refuges or changing rooms.  
roughout the process, the Scottish government has said the bill would not change the current exemptions for single-sex spaces, but the amendment places such an assertion on the face of the bill.
rapporteur called for clarity on the bill, arguing that the Scottish government has failed to set out the impact of self-identification ""for the exceptions under the Equality Act that are provided based on sex"".
She appealed for the Scottish government to set aside ""sufficient time"" to consider the consequences of the reforms and ensure it is compatible with the Equality Act. 
r states: ""In finalising this bill and for future legislation, the Scottish and the UK governments must also make sure that current and future amendments to laws that have an impact on women and children are in conformity with the UK's international human rights obligations, particularly in relation to the prevention of violence and the provision of services for victims of such violence.""
Former SNP minister Ash Regan, who quit last month over its gender recognition reforms, has echoed such concerns.
In a column for The Times on Wednesday, she wrote: ""Women's single-sex spaces for privacy, safety or therapeutic purposes are enshrined in the Equality Act 2010. These important protections will be impossible to uphold when anyone can decide they are a woman and have a GRC to prove their legal status.
""If this bill is to be enacted, there needs to be clear guidance for institutions and business to ensure they operate within the law. There are so many unanswered questions.""
Scottish government said it would respond to Ms Alsalem in detail on the issues, many of which had been addressed during stage one and two of the bill. 
""We have always been clear that the bill does not conflict with our continued strong commitment to uphold the rights and protections that women and girls currently have under the 2010 Equality Act and we have accepted an amendment to put that position beyond doubt,"" a spokesperson said.  
""There is overwhelming support for the principles of the bill - which aligns with the stated position of the UN Human Rights Office that being trans is not an illness and trans people should be recognised legally 'through a simple administrative process based on self-identification'.
""Over two-thirds of the parliament and members of all five parties voted in favour at stage one. We have also noted the evidence given to the Equalities Committee in support of the Bill by the UN Independent Expert on Protection from Violence and Discrimination based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity.""

During An Audience with Adele, the singer was asked questions by celebrities inside the London Palladium, with Harry Potter and Love Actually actress Emma Thompson asking her who had inspired her when she was younger.
She replied with a story about Ms McDonald, saying: ""She was cool and so relatable and likeable, that I really looked forward to my English lessons.""
""She left in year eight but she got me really into literature, I've always been obsessed with English and obviously now I write lyrics,"" Adele explained.
""She was so cool, so engaging, and she really made us care, and we knew that she cared about us and stuff like that.""

""You're amazing darling, I am so proud of you,"" she told Adele, bringing her to tears, so much so that she had to get her make-up fixed before carrying on with the show.
Adele graduated from the Brit School of Performing Arts & Technology before beginning her climb to the top of pop star career ladder.
Other stars who returned to their studies after finding fame
After postponing her widely discussed Las Vegas residency earlier this year to her fans' dismay, due to delivery delays and Covid, Adele - who now resides in LA and doesn't like touring - is finally set to perform in Sin City from next month.
Ahead of the shows, the singer this week released a new music video to accompany her (latest) soulful break-up ballad, I Drink Wine, taken from her fourth studio album - the biggest-selling album of 2021.
Joe Talbot-directed video finds her floating down a river in a rubber ring, while holding a glass of wine in one hand and an almost-empty wine bottle in the other.

She performed the track at February's Brit Awards, where she won album of the year for 30 and single of the year for another track, Easy On Me.
Adele has had four number one albums, entitled 19, 21, 25 and 30.

Flying drones will cut delivery times between hospitals by more than an hour and speed up pathology results, the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust (UHMBT) said.
Electrically-charged drones will slash the trust's carbon footprint, it added.
Phil Woodford from UHMBT said the £1.4m project will cut out traffic delays and pollution.
It is part of the government's Future Flight Challenge to develop greener ways of flying.

Mr Woodford told BBC Radio Lancashire: ""This is electrically charged and runs on batteries by utilising solar and wind back at the landing pads we can get this to net zero and any surplus by solar or wind we can put back to the grid.""
He said it was ""unnecessary"" to add to pollution and have someone sitting in traffic ""when we have a machine that can do it for us safely"".

health	How Covid has dealt the NHS a lasting blow	"NHS in England has more funding and staff than before the pandemic - but in many types of care, it is treating fewer patients. Why? A leading think tank has tried to come up with some answers.
Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says this is a puzzle with no simple explanation - but the pandemic has dealt a lasting blow to the NHS and it could be costing more to treat patients, on average, than before.
Despite higher staff sickness rates, compared with pre-pandemic levels, the NHS has available to work:
But - not counting those filled by patients who have tested positive for Covid, even though they may be there mainly for something else -  there were 5% fewer beds available in the third quarter of this year than in 2019, the IFS says. The impact of the virus has lasted longer than expected. 
It is also harder to discharge medically fit patients because of problems with community care.  
And evidence, such as rising numbers of disability-benefit claimants, suggests there are more ill patients needing complex care.
monthly data shows 4% more GP appointments in England than in the same month in 2019, which is ""particularly striking"" as the number of fully qualified general practitioners has fallen, the IFS says.
re were also more first cancer hospital outpatient appointments - but fewer overall and the number of patients treated from the waiting list, currently 7.2 million in England, was down 11%.
f NHS finances has been well documented and the report says the real value of the current spending plans has been reduced by inflation.
IFS research economist Max Warner says: ""The NHS is showing clear signs of strain heading into the winter and is treating fewer patients than it was pre-pandemic, across many types of care. 
""The real risk, almost three years on from the start of the pandemic, is that the Covid hit to NHS performance is not time-limited. 
""Going forward, we need to grapple with the possibility that the health service is just able to treat fewer patients with the same level of resources.""
A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""As the IFS report acknowledges, Covid had a significant impact on the NHS, and we are focused on delivering the biggest catch-up programme in health history"".
NHS had reduced waits of 18 months by 60% in a year and ""virtually eliminated"" waits of more than two years.
""We're allocating an extra £500 million to speed up hospital discharge, getting ambulances back on the road more quickly, and increasing the number of NHS call handlers.""
f a series of IFS reports. 
first found the NHS was doing less than before the pandemic, despite more staff and funding.
But this one is designed to highlight the complexities and mitigating factors, concluding there are significant long-term changes to the health and care landscape worthy of further investigation."	/news/health-63962629
entertainment	Rosie Cooper: MP at centre of murder plot criticises 'stupid' ITV drama	"A Labour MP who was the target of a far-right murder plot has delivered a stinging criticism of ITV over a drama about how the plan was foiled.
Rosie Cooper told the House of Commons she had been ""used as a marketing tool"" for five-part series The Walk-In.
Referring to previous death threats, she said: ""How many more will come from this stupid, stupid, stupid series?""
ITV said the show was ""overwhelmingly in the public interest"" and had been made ""carefully and responsibly"".
rama, which started last month, stars Stephen Graham as former National Front member-turned-Hope Not Hate activist Matthew Collins, who got a tip-off in 2017 about the threat to Ms Cooper.
rrest and jailing of a neo-Nazi who had bought a machete to kill the West Lancashire MP.
Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday, Ms Cooper said: ""I'm appalled at ITV's recent treatment of the threats to MPs. I've been used as a marketing tool by both Hope Not Hate and ITV.
""What excuse is there for a press release that says, 'Who is Rosie Cooper and who wanted to murder her'? There is no defence to that.""
ITV, which also broadcast a documentary about the real story on Monday, said it was ""very sympathetic to the horrific ordeal Rosie Cooper MP has experienced"".
""But we'd like to point out that this has never been the emphasis of our press and marketing around the series, The Walk-In. The series has never been described in this way in any ITV press release."" 
However, an explainer link on the ITV website titled ""Who is Rosie Cooper and who wanted to murder her?"" is still live.
'An important story'
In the Commons, Ms Cooper requested that ITV and Hope Not Hate donate ""all monies and profits"" from the series to the Jo Cox Foundation, set up following the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in 2016.
Ms Cooper said she had received numerous threats, ""all piggybacking on the original threat"", adding: ""In fact, there is one case with the Director of Public Prosecutions right now. And how many more will come from this stupid, stupid, stupid series?""
She also recalled how she had been granted a government car at the end of one related trial at the Old Bailey because ""ITV's despicable cameraman chased me up and down the road"".
In its statement, ITV said: ""From Hillsborough, Bloody Sunday, Appropriate Adult, Little Boy Blue and A Confession to The Lost Honour of Christopher Jeffries, ITV has a long record of broadcasting factual dramas based on or representing real events. 
""Like these, The Walk-In is an important story which we believe it is overwhelmingly in the public interest to broadcast. We always conduct the making of these series carefully and responsibly.""
A Hope Not Hate spokesperson said: ""We sympathise with Rosie Cooper for everything she has been through in recent years. No-one should endure murder threats simply for doing their job.
""Clearly, we are disappointed to hear Rosie's words in the chamber today. In 2017, several members of our organisation worked tirelessly and at tremendous sacrifice to themselves to foil the murder plot against Rosie Cooper.
""This ITV drama and documentary highlight the very real danger of far-right extremism - especially for those in public life. 
""Since the broadcast, we've had several current and former members of the organised far right get in touch to seek support leaving the far right as well as concerned members of the public who have asked for support for family members who have been radicalised.
""We cannot change what has happened to Rosie Cooper but we can continue to work to tackle far-right extremism.""
Ms Cooper's comments came after the Conservative chair of the Foreign Affairs committee raised the issue with the the Commons Speaker.
Alicia Kearns said: ""ITV has made a drama series about the heinous plan to murder the honourable lady for West Lancashire, whose permission I have to make this point of order.
""What advice can you give to members in this situation to ensure that the facts are fairly presented, that threats on the lives of our colleagues are not treated as entertainment... and that these series do not risk re-victimising those of us still living under significant threat from life?""
Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, replied that the safety of MPs, their families and staff was ""one of my highest priorities"".
""Like all members of this House, however, I would have thought that any depiction of threats made against parliamentarians is undertaken responsibly based on the facts and mindful of the impact of those subject to those such threats.""
He added that ""we all stand in awe of the bravery"" that Ms Cooper had shown.
She recently said she was standing down as an MP, explaining that ""events I have faced have taken their toll""."	/news/entertainment-arts-63487213
politics	Rupert Murdoch pays £11,000 for Boris Johnson to visit	"Media tycoon Rupert Murdoch paid more than £11,000 for Boris Johnson to visit him in the US last month, the latest list of MPs' financial interests shows.
Mr Johnson and two staff members were flown to Montana on 11 and 12 October - with internal US flights, accommodation and hospitality paid for by Mr Murdoch.
r held a private meeting, the BBC understands. 
ws Mr Johnson was paid £276,000 for a speech five weeks after leaving Downing Street.
On 14 October - a few days after visiting Mr Murdoch - Mr Johnson spoke to the Council of Insurance Agents and Brokers in Colorado Springs. He gave a 30-minute speech and a 45-minute ""fireside chat"" at the event.
former PM worked for eight-and-a-half hours, meaning he was paid an hourly rate of more than £32,400. Mr Johnson and two members of staff also received free transport and accommodation.
Register of Members' Financial Interests is published twice a month and shows MPs' outside income, gifts, visits and other benefits - anything they receive which could influence their actions, speeches or votes in Parliament.
Mr Johnson's visit to Mr Murdoch - who reportedly bought a ranch in Montana last December - came just over a week before Liz Truss resigned as UK prime minister. Her resignation sparked a leadership race which saw Mr Johnson win support to run, before dramatically withdrawing from the contest.
It is not the first time Mr Johnson and Mr Murdoch have met. The pair held several meetings while Mr Johnson was prime minister - according to Cabinet Office records - and also met when Mr Johnson was mayor of London. 
Mr Murdoch's News Corp owns several newspapers including the Wall Street Journal in the US, and the Sun and the Times in the UK. 
For decades the billionaire was a force in politics at the highest level. But after the phone-hacking scandal and the closure of The News of The World in 2011, his political allies deserted him and his reputation was knocked.
However his influence began to rise again when political hopefuls such as Nigel Farage and former US President Donald Trump approached Mr Murdoch for help.
week, news outlets that are part of Mr Murdoch's empire appeared to ditch support for Mr Trump. On Tuesday night, Fox News cut away during Trump's announcement of his new White House campaign, the Wall Street Journal editorial board called Trump a ""loser"" and the New York Post covered the news with the headline: ""Florida Man Makes Announcement"".

business	Energy bills: Half of UK households face fuel poverty, EDF warns	"EDF Energy boss Philippe Commaret warns without more help households face a tough winter
Half of UK households are facing fuel poverty this winter unless the government does more to help with energy bills, EDF has warned.
Philippe Commaret, a senior executive at EDF Energy UK, said without further support, people face a ""catastrophic winter"".
Energy bills are predicted to be nearly three times higher than last winter.
A household is considered to be in fuel poverty if it has to spend 10% or more of its income on energy.
From October, all UK households will start receiving payments providing a £400 discount on their fuel bills, with eight million low-income households set to receive an additional £650.
But the Liberal Democrats, Labour and most major energy suppliers are calling for further support for households, including for the energy price cap to be frozen at current levels.
government has said no further measures will be announced before a new prime minister is in place from 5 September.
Mr Commaret, EDF Energy UK's managing director for UK customers, told the BBC the current level of support was ""much too low"" and called for additional help to be provided, including short-term help with bills and longer-term solutions such as better insulation for homes.
EDF had seen a 30% rise in calls from customers under stress and struggling to pay their bills, he said.
""All ideas to keep bills for customers flat should be considered,"" Mr Commaret said.
""Without further support from the government, more than half of UK households will likely be in fuel poverty by January.""
""By way of context, I have to mention that we face, despite the support that the government [has] already announced, a dramatic and catastrophic winter for our customer,"" he said.
Energy bosses are becoming increasingly vocal with their ideas for staving off an energy price emergency.  
Keith Anderson, the boss of Scottish Power, is going to present his £100bn plan at a meeting with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon later. 
It's a scheme that he has already run past Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who is tipped to be the next chancellor if Liz Truss is prime minister. 
So how would it work? The plan would involve the government guaranteeing loans to the energy companies, enabling them to keep bills frozen while still forking out higher prices for wholesale gas. The so-called deficit fund would be repaid through bills over the next 20 or so years.  
Energy companies want to see more action on this. They are urging members of the next government to treat the energy crisis as it did the Covid pandemic, requiring similar levels of intervention. The furlough scheme, for example, paid the wages of 11 million people and cost around £70bn.  
On Friday, the new energy price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy - will be announced.
for an average household is expected to rise to more than £3,500 from October, up from the current figure of £1,971.
Last winter, the typical bill for homes was £1,277.
A sharp rise in wholesale gas prices this week means bills are likely to rise even further next year, to as much as £4,650 from January.
On Monday the price of gas soared after Russia said it would close down a key pipeline for maintenance work. Experts fear the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which delivers Russian gas to Germany, may not reopen, making further price rises in the spring more likely.
But it is not just energy prices that are putting the squeeze on households. Overall, inflation reached 10.1% in July, pushed higher by rising food costs, especially for staples such as bread, milk, pasta and butter. Investment bank Citi predicts that inflation could pass 18% next year.
Mr Commaret said any customers concerned about their bill should contact EDF for further support.
Plans to enable households to get discounts on electricity bills if they cut use at peak times are set to be announced by the National Grid in the next two weeks.
Mr Commaret said EDF was providing additional help and advice to its 3.4 million UK customers via an app to help customers identify ways to save fuel.
For example, he said UK households could save £60 a year by switching off appliances that were not being used.
EDF, which supplies gas and electricity to UK households, is 84% owned by the French state, but will soon be fully nationalised."	/news/business-62643934
entertainment	Murder, She Wrote star Angela Lansbury dies at 96	"Dame Angela Lansbury, who won international acclaim as the star of the US TV crime series Murder, She Wrote, has died aged 96. 
ree-time Oscar nominee had a career spanning eight decades, across film, theatre and television.
Born in 1925, she was one of the last surviving stars of the Golden Age of Hollywood cinema. 
Dame Angela died in her sleep just five days before her 97th birthday, her family said in a statement. 
""The children of Dame Angela Lansbury are sad to announce that their mother died peacefully in her sleep at home in Los Angeles,"" the family said.
Born in London, Dame Angela later moved to New York and attended the Feagin School of Dramatic Art.
She was noticed by a Hollywood executive at a party in 1942, and given her first role as a maid in the 1944 film Gaslight, based on the 1938 play of the same name. Her portrayal earned her an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress the following year.
rm ""gaslighting"" originated from Patrick Hamilton's play, which was about a young woman whose husband slowly manipulates her into believing she is going crazy.
British star went on to land two more Oscar nominations as Sibyl in The Picture of Dorian Gray in 1945 and Laurence Harvey's manipulative mother in The Manchurian Candidate - opposite Frank Sinatra - in 1962. 
After a move on to Broadway in the 1960s she won several Tony Awards, including one for her turn as Nellie Lovett in Stephen Sondheim's 1979 musical play Sweeney Todd.
She appeared in the Disney hit Bedknobs and Broomsticks in 1971, and later featured in other children's films, providing the voice for Mrs Potts in the animated Beauty and the Beast; and more recently Mary Poppins Returns. 
But it was her portrayal of sleuth Jessica Fletcher in the television series Murder, She Wrote which gained her millions of fans across the world. 
She took up the role in 1984, and continued for 12 years and nine seasons. 
w made her one of the wealthiest women in the US at the time, with a fortune estimated at $100m.
""I worked much harder on a character in the theatre than I do playing Jessica,"" Lansbury said in a TV interview in 1985. 
""Jessica's much closer to home for me. She's an easy-going woman. 
""It's just that I can relate to her,"" she added.
Her later accolades included an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement in 2013 at the age of 88. 
During the ceremony, fellow actor Geoffrey Rush praised her as the ""living definition of range"". 
It followed a lifetime achievement award from Bafta in 2002, as well as a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
She was made a Dame in 2014 for services to drama, charitable work and philanthropy. 
Dame Angela Lansbury speaks to the BBC's Andrew Marr in 2014
ributes following her death lauded a ""legend"" of Hollywood. 
Actor Josh Gad wrote on Twitter: ""It is rare that one person can touch multiple generations, creating a breadth of work that defines decade after decade. Angela Lansbury was that artist.""
Fellow actor Harvey Fierstein added that Dame Angela was ""everything"". 
Actress Mia Farrow, who starred in the 1978 film Death on the Nile alongside Dame Angela, wrote that it was ""an honour"" to have worked with her.
Oscar-winner Viola Davis wrote that she thought the late star ""would live forever"". ""What an absolutely beautiful legacy you've left,"" she posted. ""You have influenced generations of actors to aspire to excellence.""
Seinfeld actor Jason Alexander tweeted that ""one of the most versatile, talented, graceful, kind, witty, wise, classy ladies I've ever met has left us"", adding: ""Her huge contribution to the arts and the world remains always.""
Comedian and actress Kathy Griffin wrote: ""I cannot tell you how many ladies and gays are crushed, moved and feeling nostalgic about something in the past with the news of the passing of the fabulous Dame Angela Lansbury.""
Many tributes mentioned Dame Angela's work to raise awareness and money for Aids in the 1980s and 90s, fronting a TV information campaign and headlining fundraising events. 
Dame Angela was married twice, briefly to the actor Richard Cromwell when she was 19, and later to the British actor and producer Peter Shaw.

business	Government must help with energy costs, businesses say	"Businesses in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire have said the government ""must step in"" and help with soaring energy costs or firms will go bust.
Ofgem has announced the average household energy bill will hit £3,549 from 1 October but businesses are not covered by a price cap.
Fish merchant Nathan Godley said his bill would more than quadruple from £21,000 to £91,000 later this year.
government has been contacted for a comment.
Mr Godley, who owns Premier Seafoods in Grimsby, said it would be ""very difficult"" to manage without government help.
""If I could magic an extra £70,000 out of the air I would have done it last year and had some fancy holidays,"" he said.
Mr Godley's business uses a number of walk-in refrigeration and freezing units, and displays need to be left on 24 hours a day. 
He said he was facing pressure to pass on the costs to customers.
""If you do put the prices up too much then you're alienating the customers [who] have got bills to pay as well,"" he told the BBC.
""Without help, without the government stepping in and helping us independent, small businesses, then there will be trouble ahead.""
Independent retailer Debra Pye, who owns an antiques shop in Hull, said she had been forced to take some of the lightbulbs out of her premises to cut costs. 
She told the Local Democracy Reporting Service pressure was mounting on small businesses like hers because customers were scaling back on ""small luxuries"" amid rocketing living costs.
""Rising costs are affecting our customers as well. If you asked any other business they'd tell you the same thing.""
Ms Pye said other local businesses had recently closed.
""I don't think things have been this bad since at least around the time of the miners' strike in the 1980s,"" she said. 
""The big retailers will be fine, it's the small guys like us who will suffer."" 
Lucy Wilkinson, who runs a tanning studio in Lincoln, said her annual energy prices had increased from £18,500 to £73,000.
£54,500 hike resulted in two of her staff being made redundant in order to keep the business going.
Ms Wilkinson said a third of her income was going to be spent on electricity, leaving her no choice but to pass on the increase to her customers from September.
""I feel awful about my girls. I'm very scared. Are we going to lose customers? Yes probably,"" she added. 
""I'm going to have to make cutbacks. I want to survive, being 18 years in the business, but I don't know if we can.""

technology	Sharing pornographic deepfakes to be illegal in England and Wales	"A planned new law would make sharing pornographic deepfakes without consent a crime in England and Wales.
kling the rise in manipulated images, where a person's face is put on someone else's body, is part of a crackdown on the abuse of intimate pictures in the Online Safety Bill.
w would also make it easier to charge people with sharing intimate photos without consent.
Prosecutors would no longer need to prove they intended to cause distress.
In some cases under the existing law, men have admitted sharing women's intimate images without consent, but have not been prosecuted because they said they did not intend to cause any harm.
government says around one in 14 adults in England and Wales say they have been threatened with their intimate images being shared against their will. 
It also says there are growing global concerns about technology being used to create fake pornographic images and video, with one website which creates nude images from clothed ones receiving 38 million visits last year.
In August, BBC Panorama exposed a network of men on the social media site Reddit who traded women's nudes online - including some which had been faked - as well as harassing and threatening the women.
Law Commission said reporting such as this, along with campaigners' calls for stronger laws, helped to make a ""compelling case"" to government for reform.
It outlined recommendations earlier this year to ensure all examples of deliberately taking or sharing intimate images without consent are illegal.
government said some of these - including specific laws against ""downblousing"", installing hidden cameras, and threatening to share someone's intimate images - would be dealt with in future legislation, but it did not offer any timescale.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had promised to criminalise downblousing, a term for taking photos down a woman's top without her consent, in this summer's Tory leadership contest. The move would bring it in line with an earlier law against ""upskirting"".
Announcing the measures, Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said the government accepted there were gaps in the law and it needed to adapt to the changing use of technology.
He said he wanted to ""give women and girls the confidence that the justice system is on their side and will really come down like a ton of bricks on those who abuse or intimidate them"".
Ayesha - not her real name - told Panorama in August how videos secretly filmed by a partner and faked images of her were being shared on Reddit, driving her to try to take her own life.
She told the BBC that the new announcement gave her hope that police could take action and the harassment she experienced would finally end.
""It will make a massive change to my life and to many other lives as well. We'll be actually able to live and to breathe in peace without having to be scared,"" she said.
Kate Isaacs, who told a BBC documentary last month how she was targeted by deepfake creators after campaigning against non-consensual porn, says tackling the issue requires more than a change in the law.
""I think it's deeply rooted in society at this point. We don't have time. The technology is running 1,000 miles quicker than we are,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday.
She said even for an seasoned campaigner on this issue, having her own image and her identity violated by deepfakers had been a frightening experience.
""I had given advice to so many survivors on what you should do if you become a victim of this crime. But I just froze, and didn't follow any of my own advice. I think it was just too scary to comprehend and process at the time,"" she said.
Georgie has been campaigning to change the law around intimate image abuse
One deepfake porn creator told the BBC earlier this year that the risk of prosecution could make him stop.
""If I could be traced online I would stop there and probably find another hobby,"" he said.
Ministry of Justice also said it was looking at whether it could give the victims of intimate image abuse the same anonymity as the victims of sexual offences are granted, in line with the Law Commission's recommendations.
Prof Clare McGlynn at Durham University, an expert in image-based sexual abuse, told the BBC the changes were ""a testament to the courage of women who have been speaking up"", but added that it was ""absolutely vital that anonymity is granted immediately"".
""Victims tell us that not being able to be anonymous means they are more reluctant to report to the police and it means cases are more often dropped,"" she said."	/news/technology-63669711
health	Ambulance patient's 20-hour wait at Worcestershire Royal	"A patient had to wait 20 hours in the back of an ambulance as NHS pressures saw acute handover delays at hospitals.
Sunday's ordeal at Worcestershire Royal came amid West Midlands backlogs that one ambulance worker called a ""car crash"".
Meanwhile, the average response time for ambulances to reach emergency patients hit nearly 11 minutes locally. Guidelines say it should be seven.
region's ambulance service said it was working hard to prevent delays.
Worcestershire Royal Hospital - which has recently opened a new multi million-pound extension to its emergency department - was forced for more than seven hours on Sunday to divert ambulances to Alexandra Hospital in the same county.
rust which runs the sites has been contacted for comment.
Elsewhere in the region, on Monday morning, 80% of the ambulances in Shropshire's fleet were outside Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Princess Royal Hospital, Telford.
One ambulance had been waiting at Shrewsbury since 13:39 GMT the day before, with a total of eight patients collected on Sunday still not admitted.
Scores of patients across the region have had to wait outside hospitals for more than one hour - with 37 such delays at Royal Stoke alone.
A spokesperson for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: ""The ambulance service relies on each part of the health and social care system working together so that our ambulances can get to patients in the community quickly.
""Sadly, the pressures we are seeing in health and social care lead to long hospital handover delays, with our crews left caring for patients that need admitting to hospital rather than responding to the next call.  The result is that our crews are delayed reaching patients.
""We are working incredibly hard with all of our NHS and social care partners to prevent these delays; looking at new ways to safely hand over patients quickly so that our crews can respond more rapidly and save more lives.""
Sara Biffen, acting chief operating officer for Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, which runs the Royal Shrewsbury and Princess Royal sites, said: ""We along with other hospitals continue to experience severe pressure.
""We are sorry that patients are having to wait long times as we continue to prioritise patients with the most critical needs.
""We are doing everything we can, alongside partners, to improve flow in and out of hospitals for all our patients.""

technology	Isle of Man undersea internet cable work completed	"Work to install an undersea internet cable in Manx waters to strengthen the island's connections with Ireland and the UK has been completed.
47-mile (75km) of fibre optic cable has landing points at Port Erin and Port Grenaugh.
k will increase the resilience and reliability of the island's web connections, a government spokesman said.
f minister said that was ""critical"" to future economic growth.
It takes the number of undersea cables connected to the Isle of Man to seven.
kesman said having several cables would allow continued connectivity should one be damaged.
was part of the wider Celtix-Connect 2 project by Aqua Comms, which works to improve links between the UK, Ireland, mainland Europe and America.
Chief Minister Alfred Cannan said: ""Businesses place great importance in the quality of our off-island connectivity so I welcome the investment by Aqua Comms and its partners and am delighted to see the cable go live.""
with the government's National Telecommunications Strategy, which aims to improve the island's connectivity with global markets and services.
Richard Oliphant, of government agency Digital Isle of Man, said cable was ""critically important for the island's communications in the decades ahead"".
He added: ""From people using the internet to someone swiping their credit card in a shop, to businesses of all shapes and sizes, it will play a vital role in delivering that connectivity.""

politics	Rishi Sunak calls for stability and unity as he wins contest to be PM	"Rishi Sunak, who will become the next UK prime minister within hours, has issued a plea for unity in the face of a ""profound economic challenge"".
He won the Tory leadership contest  after rival Penny Mordaunt failed to secure enough backing from MPs.
In his first speech, Mr Sunak said bringing his party and the UK together would be his ""utmost priority"".
Mr Sunak, 42, will be the UK's first British Asian prime minister and the youngest for more than 200 years.
Mr Sunak - a practising Hindu - is expected to take office later this morning after being formally appointed by the King.
He replaces Liz Truss, following her resignation just 45 days into her tumultuous premiership last week.
After chairing her final cabinet meeting at 09:00 BST, the outgoing prime minister will make a statement outside No 10 before travelling to Buckingham Palace for her final audience with the King.
will be followed by Mr Sunak's first audience with the monarch, during which he will be invited to form a government. 
He will then travel to Downing Street to make a statement at about 11:35, before entering No 10.
President Joe Biden has said he plans to call Mr Sunak to ""offer his congratulations"" after his meeting with the King, the White House Press Secretary said.
Mr Sunak takes office as the third Conservative prime minister since the party won the last general election in 2019 - prompting Labour to lead calls for an early general election as a result.
In his speech on Monday - which took place behind closed doors - Mr Sunak told Tory MPs this was going to be a tough period and ruled out an early general election, MP Simon Hoare said.
former chancellor said the Conservative Party, trailing Labour in the polls by huge margins, was facing an ""existential threat"", but could win the next election by uniting.
ree MPs in the room told PA Media news agency Mr Sunak's message to the party was ""unite or die"", as they focus on delivering on the public's priorities during a cost of living crisis.
Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith, who backed Liz Truss in the summer leadership contest, said it would be ""really dangerous"" for the party to continue internal rows.
""It's time to make sure we govern and get the decisions right again,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.
Later, in a TV address that lasted less than two minutes, Mr Sunak promised to serve with ""integrity"" and thanked outgoing Prime Minister Liz Truss for leading the country during ""exceptionally difficult circumstances"".
""The United Kingdom is a great country but there is no doubt we face a profound economic challenge,"" he said. ""We now need stability and unity and I will make it my utmost priority to bring our party and our country together.""
Mr Sunak's coronation, in effect, as Tory leader caps a rapid political comeback by the former chancellor after he lost out to Ms Truss in the last leadership contest during the summer.
Ms Truss - whose tax-cutting agenda Mr Sunak dismissed as ""fairytale economics"" - tweeted to congratulate him and offer her ""full support"".
Her successor will take office at a time of economic crisis and pressure on public finances, exacerbated by Ms Truss's mini-budget, most of which has been scrapped.
Watch: Rishi Sunak makes first public address since winning Tory leadership contest
Mr Sunak's leadership rival Penny Mordaunt withdrew from the latest contest minutes before the result was announced, admitting it was ""clear that colleagues feel we need certainty today"".
""This decision is an historic one and shows, once again, the diversity and talent of our party,"" Ms Mordaunt said. ""Rishi has my full support.""
Ms Mordaunt took the leadership race to the wire, but came under pressure to unite behind Mr Sunak after former Prime Minister Boris Johnson withdrew from the contest on Sunday.
Mr Johnson - who resigned as prime minister only seven weeks ago - claimed he had enough support to stand but acknowledged now was ""not the right time"".
Sources told the BBC that Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson met on Saturday as Tory MPs decided who to back in the second Tory leadership contest in four months.
Mr Sunak was chancellor in Mr Johnson's government and within weeks of taking the role had to steer the UK economy through the Covid-19 pandemic.
But he quit as chancellor in July after the government was dogged by scandals, giving momentum to a cabinet mutiny that forced Mr Johnson from office.
First elected as an MP for the constituency of Richmond in North Yorkshire in 2015, Mr Sunak has experienced a meteoric rise to the apex of British politics.
Before becoming an MP, Mr Sunak worked in finance and is thought to be one of the richest MPs.
But his family's finances came under intense scrutiny earlier this year, when the tax affairs of his wife, Akshata Murty, were placed in the spotlight.
Age: 42
Place of birth: Southampton
Home: London and Yorkshire
Education: Winchester College, Oxford University, Stanford University
Family: Married to businesswoman Akshata Murty with two daughters
Parliamentary constituency: Richmond (Yorkshire)
Opposition parties have been clamouring for a general election, arguing that Mr Sunak does not have a democratic mandate to become prime minister.
Mr Sunak will be the fourth consecutive prime minister - after Theresa May, Mr Johnson and Ms Truss - to take the role of leader without a general election, although Mrs May and Mr Johnson both won general elections as PMs in 2017 and 2019.
xt general election is not due to take place until January 2025 at the latest, after the Conservatives won a landslide majority in 2019.
Mr Sunak is under no obligation to call an early election under the UK's parliamentary political system. 
Labour's Pat McFadden, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the Conservative Party has brought ""instability and chaos"". 
""The party [Mr Sunak] represents is part of the problem, not the solution,"" he told BBC Breakfast. 
He argued the country needed a ""proper, new government"" rather than a ""game of musical chairs at the top of the Tory Party"". 
Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey reiterated his calls for a general election, though accepted it was unlikely right now. 
""It's increasingly clear the Tories don't trust the British people,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme.
Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Sunak should call an early general election and must not ""unleash another round of austerity""."	/news/uk-politics-63375281

politics	Rwanda: PM Rishi Sunak refuses to be drawn on Rwanda figures	"Asked how many people the UK government planned to send to Rwanda by the end of next year, Rishi Sunak declined to give an exact figure.
He says the government expected further legal challenges, which it would pursue ""as necessary"". But pushed for a figure, he said he could provide one as the scheme was a ""commercial contract"". 
Labour's Dame Diana Johnson also asked him about the cost of the Rwanda plan when he appeared before the Liaison Committee of senior backbench MPs.

entertainment	Ealing Studios: Iconic London film facility set for makeover	"One of the world's oldest film studios, which has played an iconic role in British film and television, is set to get a makeover that will mean it can compete with Hollywood once more.
Ealing Studios in west London has made movies such as Bridget Jones, St. Trinians' and The Theory of Everything.
However, it is now small and outdated compared to other working studios. 
Plans approved by councillors last week want to transform it into ""the most advanced studio in the world"".
udio has been making films since 1902 and hosted stars like Audrey Hepburn.
works will see a new 14,000-sq-ft stage (1300-sq-m) installed, which the developers say will take 18 months to build, as well as new workshops and additional office space.
w glossy building has been designed to honour the distinctive Art Deco aesthetic of the original 1930's Grade II listed sound stages that still exist at the studio, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
udios also want to play their part in preserving the planet, as the developers will aim to make Ealing Studios the first Net Zero Carbon stage in the UK.
As major streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime continue to grow, councillor Anthony Kelly said the plans would enable Ealing studios to compete.
Councillor Anthony Kelly said: ""There is an inherent challenge about keeping specific film stuff in film studios, but one of the ways of overcoming that is to actually have the right type of stage and studio space.
""Ten miles away there's the second biggest film stage in Europe, the 007 stage in Pinewood is massive - it's the size of three football fields - that's not what they do at Ealing [currently].
""We mustn't second guess the industry, they are the type of studios they want, they are the type of studios they've applied for, so we've got to take them at what they want.""
udios were previously owned by the BBC, and became home to famous series such as Porridge and Doctor Who.
After being sold by the BBC in 2000, the studios continued to host several blockbusters, including The Darkest Hour and Bridget Jones.
Barnaby Thompson, partner at Ealing Studios, welcomed the approval of the development: ""This is the next stage in our evolution, responding to a need for greater studio space as well as recognising the need to become a more sustainable industry.
""We want the studio to be a home for talent for generations to come.""

health	Empty Southend care beds are criminal says health boss	"A care home manager said it was ""criminal"" that more hospital patients were not being discharged into empty beds within the community.
Michael Daley, who is also chair of the South Essex Care and Health Association, said he did not understand why some homes were not being used.
's records showed there were 45 empty beds across 17 care homes in the area.
Southend Hospital said it worked ""closely with partners"".
""If you are in hospital for weeks on end, I think it's pretty criminal to be honest,"" said Mr Daley, resident manager at Cavell Lodge in Leigh-on-Sea, speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
""I don't understand why they are not being placed in some of these [care homes].
""We're in a crisis situation. Surely it would be better to move somebody elderly into a warm home, which is more homely than keeping them in an acute area blocking the bed for somebody that needs it.""
Southend-on-Sea City Council is reluctant to place patients in care homes rated inadequate or requires improvement by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).
's register showed that Melrose House in Southend, rated requires improvement, had 15 unoccupied beds. Abbeyfield care home in Westcliff is rated good but has nine empty beds. 
Latest figures from the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust showed that Southend, Basildon and Broomfield hospitals had an average of 93 patients at the end of each day, during October, who ""no longer met the criteria to reside"".
Southend Hospital CQC inspection, however, concluded that the discharge of surgery and medical care patients was ""in line with good practice"".
Kay Mitchell, the council's Labour cabinet member for adult social care and health integration, said homes rated requires improvement, or below, were found ""to not be delivering good quality care"".
She added that the council kept in contact with homes to find beds for the ""small number"" who needed them.
A spokeswoman for the Mid and South Essex Integrated Care System, on behalf of the Trust, said it ""continues to work closely with partners across the wider health and care system to ensure our patients are discharged safely and when they are clinically ready"".

business	Homeowners 'tearing their hair out' over rising rates and rents	"During the financial crisis in 2008, Philip Wilson says he became a somewhat reluctant landlord.
roperty market had slowed considerably so he decided to rent out, rather than sell, two properties - a flat and a house in North and West Yorkshire. 
Now, the upheaval in the mortgage market means he is being forced to push up the rent for his tenants, and is considering whether he will eventually have to sell up.
""I really feel for my tenants,"" the 64-year-old says. ""One of them is really struggling, she pays her rent in parts when she has the cash. But now I'm going to have to tell her that her rent is going up. She has been [paying] £395 a month, and it's now looking like it will go up to £450. That is quite an increase.
""But I've swallowed several interest rate rises this year without increasing rents. Now I have to pass them on. 
""Hand on heart, once this crisis is over, I'll be selling both properties. I feel sorry for my tenants but I can't be a charity.""
He is one of many people pointing out that the rising costs of mortgages affects more people than just the 100,000 or so homeowners a month whose existing fixed-rate deals are expiring.
Landlords, like Mr Wilson, are having to pass on higher costs to tenants if they are on variable rates, which have seen consistent increases throughout the year, or more expensive new fixed deals.
most obvious change in the last fortnight, following the mini-budget, has been with fixed-rate deals.
On Wednesday, the interest rate on the average two-year fixed rate mortgage hit 6% for the first time for 14 years, according to the financial information service Moneyfacts.
following day, a typical five-year fixed rate product had a rate over 6% for the first time for 12 years.
ft many people unsure and uneasy about what to do next.
Alice Heywood, a digital curator from Edinburgh, has been looking at what the increases mean for her when her current deal expires in June.
""I've been overpaying my mortgage by £100 as I'm really keen on reducing the overall term. I was doing well with my current deal. I knew interest rates would go up, of course they would, but I thought it would be an incremental hike, not an overnight jump,"" the 47-year-old says.
She is facing repayments on a new deal that are £200 a month higher than she had expected. 
""It's so gut-wrenching because I'd been doing all the right things - really trying to reduce my mortgage debt, getting a permanent and stable job. I just feel like the rug has been pulled from underneath my feet.""
While Ms Heywood's stomach has been churning, Michael Bird says he and his girlfriend have been tearing their hair out.
45-year-old from Sheffield was expecting to get close to a house purchase any day, but that is now at risk because first-time buyers down the chain have been unable to secure a mortgage at the higher rates.
""The whole process was taking ages. Now waiting to hear from our solicitors if anything can be done,"" he says.
""It's very frustrating. We have an 11-month-old sleeping in our room and were hoping to have her in her own room by now.
""Now we just have to wait again.""
Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng met with officials from the major mortgage lenders on Thursday to discuss the situation.
A Treasury statement following the meeting said that ""while it is the responsibility of the sector to provide the best value for mortgage rates"", the chancellor confirmed the Treasury would ""continue to work closely with the sector"" in the weeks and months ahead.
During her speech at the Conservative Party conference, Prime Minister Liz Truss said that the government ""will do what we can"" to support homeowners. 
However, she said that the benchmark interest rate was set independently by the Bank of England."	/news/business-63160377
business	What will be closing for the Queen's funeral?	"Daily routines will come to a halt for many people in Scotland as the Queen's state funeral is held on Monday.
A UK bank holiday was approved by King Charles III for the day of the funeral of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, at Westminster Abbey in London. 
In Scotland, schools, colleges and universities will close along with many shops and visitor attractions. 
Essential services provided by councils will continue, but some health services will be put on hold.
A period of national mourning will end on Monday after the state funeral for the Queen, Britain's longest reigning monarch, who died at her Scottish estate in Balmoral last week.
Across Scotland's 32 local authority areas, non-essential services such as sports facilities, museums and libraries will be closed on Monday, along with primary and secondary schools and council nurseries.
Essential council services including waste collection will continue, although actual collections times may vary and recycling centres will be shut in most areas.
Home care services provided by councils will continue. 
Gardens of remembrance will also remain open. Arrangements are being made to facilitate weddings, burials and cremations that have already been booked to take place on Monday.
Council staff will be paid their normal bank holiday rates. In Edinburgh, where council staff and schools were already scheduled to be off for a local holiday, workers have been told they will be entitled to another day of annual leave.
Scottish Courts confirmed that no courts or tribunals would sit on Monday, but arrangements were being made for all sheriffdoms to hold custody courts on Saturday.
NHS Scotland said measures were being put in place to enable vital healthcare services to continue, with some planning being made on a local level by Scotland's 14 health boards.
GP surgeries, community pharmacies, and dental and optometry practices have been left to decide whether to open or not and will contact affected patients.
Planned treatments, including surgery, are expected to proceed as scheduled. However, patients who wish to cancel a procedure on Monday will be allowed to do so without it counting towards their two reasonable offers of appointment. 
Appointments for the winter Covid vaccination programme will go ahead with clinics offering the opportunity to reschedule.
Dr Lailah Peel, chairwoman of the BMA Scotland junior doctor committee, urged people to be ""as patient as possible"". 
She told BBC Scotland: ""This is a short notice bank holiday so we've not been able to put the planning in place like we normally would. 
""It is a little bit chaotic in that some things will be running normally and other things will not be, and it will be different in every board area and even department.
""Services will be running where they can because, for example, there's no point in us running a clinic if none of the patients are going to turn up.""
Shops, including the main supermarkets, will be closed across the country, with many UK-wide chains already confirming they will not open on Monday.
Sainsbury's said they would open their convenience stores at 17:00. Morrisons stores will be closed all day. WH Smith's shops at railway stations and airports will be closed for the duration of the funeral service.
Fast food companies have started announcing changes to their operating hours, with McDonalds announcing it would not open its restaurants until 17:00. Domino's told the BBC its stores would open at 12:00 on Monday, after the ceremony has finished.
Some pubs and restaurants are expected to alter their opening hours for the duration of the funeral. Brewdog has confirmed its bars will be closed until 14:00.
In Livingston, most of the 120 retailers in the town's Centre shopping centre will be closed. 
Royal Mail will suspended its postal services on the day.
UK government advises on its website that the additional bank holiday ""will allow individuals, businesses and other organisations to pay their respects to Her Majesty and commemorate Her reign, while marking the final day of the period of national mourning.""
Although it says that some businesses ""may wish to consider closing or postponing events"", there is no obligation to do so and no statutory entitlement to time off for workers.
Scottish government advised: ""Not everyone is entitled to paid leave on bank or public holidays. If in doubt, check the position with your employer.""
Many visitor attractions and heritage sites will be closed on Monday and visitors are advised to check before travelling. 
National Galleries Scotland, Historic Scotland and National Museums Scotland are among those that have announced that all their sites will shut to mark the funeral. 
Palace of Holyroodhouse, one of the Royal residences, and The Queen's Gallery in Edinburgh have been closed since the Queen's death and will not reopen during the period of mourning.
National Trust for Scotland buildings and gardens will be closed all day but countryside locations will remain open to visitors.
Other nature reserves, such as those managed by NatureScot and the RSPB, will remain open for walkers while visitor centres are closed.
Several Forestry and Land Scotland sites will remain open, including The Lodge Forest Visitor Centre and Go Ape activities at the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park, Aberfoyle.
Some theatres and cinemas, such as the Cineworld chain, will be closed. Edinburgh Playhouse and Capital Theatres will shut, but Pitlochry Festival Theatre will remain open. 
Cineworld, Empire, Odeon, Showcase and Cameo cinemas will be closed. 
Bank holiday DIY enthusiasts will have to buy their supplies in advance if they plan to stock up at one of the bigger chain stores with B&Q and Homebase saying they will be closed. 
rains will be running as normal across Scotland, as will Edinburgh Trams.
Bus companies may be running to a different timetable. Lothian Buses told the BBC it would be operating a Sunday service on Monday.
Airports in Scotland will be staffed as usual on Monday but some airlines have advised passengers to check their websites before travelling. 
BA said their flights were ""very, very busy"" on all routes. 
CalMac and P&O ferry services will operate as normal.
While most of the public spaces in Scotland will be closed for the funeral, some community spaces plan to open to allow people to watch the funeral together. 
Nine hours of live BBC footage will be broadcast on a big screen in Holyrood Park in front of the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh from 08:00. Entry is free and un-ticketed.
funeral service for Her Majesty The Queen will be broadcast live on a big screen in Holyrood Park in front of the Palace of Holyroodhouse.Veteran's charity Legion Scotland will open the doors to their clubs for members and the public on Friday morning. 
Some churches will also screen the service at Westminster Abbey, including Fettercairn Church, near Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire and the Tron Church on Bath Street, Glasgow. According to protocol, no church can hold an official remembrance or thanksgiving service for the Queen until ""some time"" after the funeral.
Most cinemas across Scotland will be closed all day on Monday, but some cinemas will live stream the funeral. Vue cinemas across Scotland and the Arc Cinema in Peterhead have offered free bookable tickets to a live screening of the ceremony in London. 
A statement on the Vue Cinemas website said: ""The Queen was renowned for her support of the UK's creative industries, having been patron of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, the Royal Variety Charity and the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund.""
Only bottled water would be available to buy on Monday and no films will be screened."	/news/uk-scotland-62902950
entertainment	An Cailín Ciúin: 'A breakthrough moment' for Irish language films	"Irish language cinema is having ""a breakthrough moment"" after An Cailín Ciúin (The Quiet Girl) became the highest-grossing Irish language film of all time.
rding to executive producer for the film, Máire Ní Chonláin.
film recently surpassed UK and Ireland box office records and has been submitted as Ireland's entry for Best International Feature at the 2023 Academy Awards.
Directed and written by Colm Bairéad, the film is based on Claire Keegan's 2010 novella, Foster.
""It has universal themes, it's a simple story about how you can grow up to be happy as a person,"" Ní Chonláin told BBC News NI.
Ní Chonláin said there was great difficulty in casting the lead role.
Producers actively searched Gaeltacht areas and approached Irish language schools before being introduced to Catherine Clinch.
film is set in 1981 and follows nine-year-old Cáit, who is withdrawn and neglected, as she is sent to live with her distant relatives in County Waterford and finally finds herself in a loving home for the first time.
It has won over critics at numerous festivals after premiering at Berlinale (Berlin International Film Festival), and had the largest Irish-language box office opening to date, eventually grossing more than €1m.
An Cailín Ciúin was produced for Cine4, a film initiative between Screen Ireland, Irish-language broadcaster TG4 and the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.
for live-action feature-length drama film projects with budgets of up to €1.2m (£1m).
Five applications annually are offered development budgets of up to €25,000. Two of these films are then selected for full production, receiving a festival and theatrical release prior to being broadcast on TG4.
""It's so important that the Irish language is being developed for films and television - we're trying to grow the independent sector,"" says Ní Chonláin.
""We want to normalise the language. You'd have often seen a French film before an Irish language film.""
Ní Chonláin has worked as commissioning editor with TG4 for more than 20 years and says Irish productions are currently gaining momentum through word-of-mouth.
Cine4 has financially backed several other productions - notably 2019's Arracht, which was set during the Great Famine of Ireland and was selected as Ireland's entry for the 93rd Academy Awards.
Arracht went on to win the prestigious Audience Award at 2020's Glasgow Film Festival, as well as further honours in America, Luxembourg, Greece and Ireland.
For many film buffs, An Cailín Ciúin acts as their entry-point to Irish language cinema, but the category has existed from as far back as 1935 with Robert J Flaherty's Oidhche Sheanchais (A Night of Storytelling). 
Produced alongside his more famous docufiction, Man of Aran, the short film opened in a small number of cinemas in Dublin and Cork on St Patrick's Day. 
At 11 minutes long, the film consists of four islanders sharing folklore around a hearth.
Critics loved it, audiences not so much and the film was quickly withdrawn from general release with all original copies presumed destroyed in a 1943 fire.
It wasn't until 2012 that a copy of the ""talkie"" mysteriously found itself re-catalogued at Harvard University's Houghton Library after being discovered in a filing cabinet. 
A nitrate print of the ﬁlm had been purchased by the university in 1935 at the request of their Department of Celtic Languages and Literatures.
A restored 35mm version premiered in 2015 before receiving its first television broadcast on TG4 in November 2016.
Irish Gaelic later made its Hollywood debut in 1952's The Quiet Man with Dubliner Maureen O'Hara, arguably Ireland's first leading lady, introducing the language to silver screens stateside. 
O'Hara treated audiences to further, fleeting moments as Gaeilge with 1955's The Long Gray Line.
Over the years the language has crept into dozens of productions. Never before has there been as much support for Irish film, but some are calling for more.
Delivered as part of Northern Ireland's New Decade, New Approach agreement, additional funding to the Ulster Scots and Irish Language Broadcast Funds have helped develop numerous film productions. 
A ""one-off uplift"" was provided by the UK's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport in 2021/21, however Northern Ireland Screen's business plan for 2022/23 said the uplift in funding was ""not to be sustained"" in future years. 
""A one-year increase in production funding is challenging to manage as it increases demand for the funding from the production companies which cannot be met in future years,"" it said.
""The reduction in funding from DCMS will impact the number of projects that can be supported and the number of training places and skills development that can be supported in 2022-23.""
Chief executive of NI Screen Richard Williams recently told BBC's Good Morning Ulster he was ""very disappointed"" by the decision.
Aine Walsh, head of the Irish Language Broadcast Fund, said while they were aware this ""hugely appreciated"" uplift was intended as a one-off payment, it remained oversubscribed.
""We've always recognised how accessible the Irish language is,"" she added.

Food, fuel and energy bills are rising faster than they have for thirty years, and many people are responding by cutting back.
BBC talked to people in Birmingham and Kent to find out how they're adapting their day-to-day spending.
Paul and Amanda are both in work, and until recently didn't really have to watch what they were spending week to week.
""Now we're doing it on a daily basis,"" says Paul.
get takeaways and go out for meals, but not as often as they used to. And when they do go out they order a jug of tap water to keep the bill down.
""We never used to do that,"" says Amanda. ""We're just more mindful now, of expenditure.""
At the supermarket, instead of buying branded products like they used to, they are looking at own-brand items, and are looking for deals.
""We can't just go in there and buy what we like now, we have to think, 'Well, hold on a minute,'"" says Paul.
""We have to look at: What do we really want? What do we really need? Do we really need that luxury? Do we really need those sweets?""
re also shopping around, and buying in bulk, ""just to make sure that if we buy this now, that will last a month or two,"" says Paul.
Paul and Amanda are not alone in cutting back on food expenditure. The survey for BBC News indicates that about two thirds of people have been eating out less, while more than half are buying fewer takeaway meals.
More than half of the survey respondents had reduced the amount of food they had bought. And more than half said they had skipped meals in the past six months to save money, with one in 10 saying they often did so.
After the shock of recent rises in her gas, electricity, and food bills, Rebecca says she decided it was time to change tack when it came to the family's shopping habits.
""We're having to make steps, clawing back a bit of money,"" she says. ""We know there's going to be [further] rises in gas and electricity coming in October, so we're just trying to get into good habits now.""
Rebecca says she has never been a ""big spender"" when it comes to fashion, but her daughter Jess does want new things.
""We're having to rein back the amount of money that we're spending on clothes. 
""We're having to make sure we're making the most of what we've got, as opposed to going out and buying new,"" she says.
She was relieved to find the secondary school Jess is due to go to is providing free school uniforms.
Over the past six months, three quarters of people have spent less on clothes for themselves, and almost half have spent less on clothes for their children, the BBC cost of living survey suggests.
Georgia is also budgeting to cope with price rises, and one way she can save money, she says, is by spending a day out at Cannon Hill Park in Birmingham, rather than taking her daughter Harper-Faye to a visitor attraction.
""I haven't got the money to go to Sea Life Centres and stuff. That's like, £25 a ticket,"" she says.
She is also cutting back on using her car. 
""The diesel [price] is absolutely crippling me,"" she says. ""I can't go out as much as I used to, not a chance. I can't afford it.
""I need to make sure I can get to work and back, and that's my priority at the moment.""
In fact overall she is not doing as much ""fun stuff"" as she used to, says Georgia.
Lisa, a disabled powerchair user who lives near Ashford in Kent, is also cutting back on her car use, due to the rise in fuel prices.
""I am having to choose whether I can afford to go out,"" she says. 
""I have a wheelchair accessible vehicle, but obviously, fuel is really expensive, so I'm having to make choices on how often I can afford to go shopping - just to get to the shops, let alone affording the price rises once you get there as well,"" she says.
""My main concerns are food and energy, so I'm having to cut back in every area of my life, just to be able to afford those two things.""
Rising bills have an impact on life, she says. ""It's not just a case of: I'll drop a brand. When you're already on the lowest brand because you couldn't afford the more expensive ones, when you were already limiting how much you could go out because of the costs, it's really bad.""
Nearly two-thirds of people in the BBC survey said they had gone on fewer days out, and roughly the same proportion said they had cut back on trips taken in the car."	/news/business-61831485
health	China Covid: France, Spain, S Korea and Israel tighten rules	"France and Spain have announced Covid testing on visitors from China, following a similar decision in Italy.
French government said passengers flying from China to France would have to present a negative Covid test less than 48 hours old before embarking.
Arrivals in Spain can skip the tests if they are fully vaccinated - and Spain does accept some Chinese vaccines.
Beijing has said it will fully reopen its borders next week for the first time since March 2020.
Its current Covid surge has caused wariness, with reports of hospitals filling up and waves of illness.
UK, South Korea and Israel also announced new testing rules on Friday, while the US and India have already imposed restrictions.
""At the national level, we will implement controls at airports and require travellers from China to present a negative Covid test or be fully vaccinated,"" said Spanish health minister Carolina Darias.
Neither France nor Spain have specified when the measures will come into force.
However, the French health and transport ministries said the government would publish a decree and notify EU member states.
On Thursday, the EU's disease prevention agency has said such measures were not justified in Europe, because of the levels of immunity and the fact that variants spreading in China were already present on the continent.
World Health Organization, however, has said it was ""understandable"" that some countries had decided to impose restrictions and urged Beijing to be more forthcoming about its Covid numbers.
China's foreign ministry said earlier this week that its ""epidemic situation"" overall was ""predictable and under control"".
But the true toll of daily cases and deaths in China is unknown as officials have stopped requiring cases to be reported, and changed classifications for Covid deaths. 
South Korean Prime Minister Han Duck-soo said that travellers from China would need to have a negative PCR or antigen test before boarding flights to South Korea. 
will also need to undergo a PCR test within the first day of their arrival in South Korea.
Israel, meanwhile, has ordered foreign airlines not to allow people to travel from China unless they have tested negative - and asked its own citizens to avoid unnecessary travel there. 
Not all countries have announced controls. Germany has joined Australia, France, and Portugal in saying there will be no new rules yet.
However, Germany's health minister has said the country is seeking a co-ordinated system to monitor variants across European airports.
China's decision this week to reopen its borders on 8 January marks the last stage of the country's controversial zero-Covid policy, which President Xi Jinping had personally endorsed.
As the rest of the world transitioned to living with the virus, Beijing maintained an eradication policy involving mass testing and stringent lockdown.
In November, the frustration spilled on to the streets in rare protests against Mr Xi and his government. A week later, Beijing began to roll back the restrictions."	/news/world-asia-china-64127917
technology	Cole Anderson-James says TikTok is way better than his sales job	"A TikTok star has said being made redundant was ""one of the best things"" that had happened to him.
Cole Anderson-James, from Colchester, Essex, was working in sales before losing his job during the pandemic.
25-year-old started doing lip syncing videos on TikTok in lockdown before creating his own sketches.
He has 1.6m followers on the platform and was cast in the Netflix show After Life after Ricky Gervais saw his videos.
""I got made redundant and it was probably one of the best things that has actually happened to me because I had way more time to spend doing the videos,"" Mr Anderson-James said.
He said he was ""bored"" and ""didn't even know what TikTok was"" when he first downloaded the app and started with the lip sync videos.
""Eventually people liked them, they started racking up views and I put them on Twitter and then moved to my own original stuff maybe six months down the line,"" he said.
Mr Anderson-James would often lip sync to sketches from The Office, which eventually caught the eye of creator Ricky Gervais.
He was given a role as a yoga teacher in the third series of Gervais' Netflix series After Life and hopes to continue acting.
""I'm carrying on with the videos,"" he said. ""They're doing good online - it's paying my wage.
""I like acting, so I'd like to do more.""
Mr Anderson-James said although the videos are short in length, they were ""actually quite time consuming"" to make.
""They take me like two or three hours with filming and editing,"" he said. ""But it's way, way better than my sales job.""

business	Food price inflation sees traders and charities struggle	"Bank of England has warned inflation might reach 11% within months, as prices put pressure on household budgets. Food businesses have seen a rapid escalation in prices, while food bank charities say donations are down as a result. So how is everyone managing?
Inflation stands at 9.1% but when it comes to food inflation, that appears to be much more brutal.
One food industry boss has warned that food prices could rise by up to 15% this year - and with average pay increases not keep pace, many people are noticing the impact to their budgets.
Savoy Catering, in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, is a wholesale supplier to the offshore gas industry, hospitals, restaurants and care homes. 
re proving to be a useful barometer of changes in prices.
A year ago the wholesalers were selling catering bags of flour at £11 a bag; it now costs £17. 
Eggs are also up from £14 to £30, and a box of butter was £34 but is now commanding £84.
Mark Harris, from the company, says ""it's the hardest we've ever seen things - it's tough out there"".
He says the ""costs have risen so far that we've got no choice"" but to pass the increases on to his customers, and agrees it would be by a considerable amount.
""Unfortunately the price hike from our suppliers has been so much that it's going to have a significant impact on the cost to our customers.
""Clearly no one's happy about the situation. Everyone's struggling nationally so it's difficult for everyone, but unfortunately we have no choice.""
Mr Harris says help with fuel costs are needed. ""With regards to fuel, obviously there's VAT and duty costs that we're not in control of. Surely the government can look at that and help small businesses?""
For its part the government says it is spending £37bn to help families as energy, food and fuel bills soar.
food price rises are affecting charities and foodbanks, which have seen demand for their services grow while donations fall off. 
Louisa Hobbs says the rises have led to more demand for services at MK Foodbank.
rations manager says the numbers coming in for food are like the numbers witnessed in January and February when heating bills are high. 
""We don't normally see anything like this in June and we suspect that's due to rising prices of food and of course fuel energy, petrol prices etc.""
mpact of increased prices has resulted in a rapid decline in donations.
""Our donations have really, really dropped. About two thirds of what is going out of the door is coming back in donations,"" she says.
rity makes up the shortfall by buying food, which increases its costs ""enormously"".
She says the situation is not sustainable, adding: ""We're not going to be able to carry on doing that forever. 
""We're trying really hard to raise extra funds, to get people to donate one or two things more, but realistically if it carries on this way, we're not going to be able to help everybody.""
Miranda Wixon is volunteer coordinator of Rural Community Larders.
She says she works with other volunteer ""food activists"" in local communities in rural parts of Northamptonshire.
rganisation started out during the pandemic delivering 40,000 boxes of groceries to people in 91 villages.
""Coming out of lockdown we realised people were not able to source the food for lots and lots of reasons, probably for reasons that existed before lockdown,"" she says.
""A massive change has happened at a very, very fast rate.
""Families are finding it increasingly difficult to provide food for their children. 
""It started off with schools telling us about breakfast needed and we provided food for schools to run breakfast clubs.""
But Ms Wixon says pensioners living in rural communities are also struggling.
""If you have no transport to get anywhere and you have to fill up an oil tank to be able to heat your home, you just don't have enough money to buy food as well.
""Food insecurity is massive everywhere.""
Alex Copeland is the chief executive of the Hope Centre, at a branch of the Salvation Army in Northampton. 
rity runs a social supermarket where people pay £10 a month for £100 of groceries.
It was set up as a charity for homeless people but since Covid has expanded to ""help with the wider poverty agenda"".
Mr Copeland says food provided tends to be essentials such as bread, eggs and milk, with lots of tins. 
""Their money just doesn't go as far,"" he says.
""Demand has really grown over the last three months, week on week. At the Hope Centre we used to see about 100 families a week, we're now looking at nearer 200.""
rity used to deliver food across four areas and is looking to expand to 10 locations.
Mr Copeland says as an organisation they are ""getting stretched so thin"".
During Covid the council provided funding, which it distributed across all the food banks in Northamptonshire.
""That money has decreased dramatically and we need both money and food.
""We've seen less donations because everyone's money is so stretched. 
""We've seen less money coming in from the council, but they're trying their best to help us.""

business	India tycoon Adani in hostile bid for news channel NDTV	"Asia's richest man Gautam Adani is seeking to take over Indian news broadcaster New Delhi Television, which is widely known as NDTV.
It comes as the multi-billionaire moved to take a majority stake in the firm.
NDTV says this ""was executed without any input from, conversation with, or consent"" of the company's founders.
Mr Adani's bid for NDTV, which operates TV channels and websites, has drawn attention because he is seen as being close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
In a statement on Tuesday, AMG Media Networks Limited (AMNL), a unit of Adani Group, said it planned to buy RRPR Holding - which owns owns 29.18% of NDTV - for an undisclosed amount.
AMNL added that it would also launch an open offer for another 26% of NDTV, which if successful would give it a majority stake of the news outlet.
keover was ""a significant milestone in the journey of AMNL's goal to pave the path of new age media across platforms,"" AMNL chief executive Sanjay Pugalia said.
""AMNL seeks to empower Indian citizens, consumers and those interested in India, with information and knowledge,"" Mr Pugalia added.
""With its leading position in news and its strong and diverse reach across genres and geographies, NDTV is the most suitable broadcast and digital platform to deliver on our vision,"" he added.
Responding to the bid, NDTV said it was only made aware of Mr Adani's intentions on Tuesday.
""NDTV has never compromised on the heart of its operations - its journalism. We continue to proudly stand by that journalism,"" the company said in a statement. The group operates three national channels and news websites. 
Adani Group did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment on Wednesday.
Mr Adani has a net worth of $135bn (£114.3bn) and is the richest man in Asia, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Analysis by Archana Shukla, India business correspondent
In a television news market which has increasingly been taken over by corporates, NDTV has stood its ground. 
Founded by media barons Radhika Roy and Prannoy Roy, who are journalists themselves, NDTV is seen as one of the few media groups that often takes a critical view of Mr Modi's government and its policies.
Unsurprisingly, NDTV has often been in the crosshairs of Mr Modi's administration and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Since he came to power in 2014, NDTV has faced a number of charges - from money laundering to tax evasion.
untry's investigative agencies - the Enforcement Directorate, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the income tax department - have slapped multiple cases against the broadcaster and its founders. Most of these are still unresolved.
NDTV has also been criticised of cosying up to the opposition political party, the Congress.
BJP representatives have at times refused to participate in interviews and panel discussions on NDTV to protest against its editorial policies.
Mr Modi, who has not held a press conference since he became prime minister, has given rare interviews to select media channels, but has never appeared on NDTV.
Mr Adani is considered close to the prime minister and his party. That has raised questions as to whether there is more to the takeover plan than just expanding his business empire.

first minister spoke to the prime minister on a video call ahead of the British-Irish Council summit of ministers from the two countries.
Mr Drakeford is not attending in person after testing positive for Covid.
Mr Sunak tweeted that it was ""great to meet"" Mr Drakeford and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
""Teamwork, absolute focus and collective effort will be required to deal with the shared challenges faced by people across the UK,"" he tweeted.
Welsh government officials said Mr Sunak and Mr Drakeford also discussed relations between their governments, which both sides have signalled they want to improve.
Liz Truss did not formally meet Mr Drakeford during her short time in office and Mr Drakeford had let it be known he thought Boris Johnson was ""awful"".
Before the meeting, a Welsh government spokesman said he ""welcomes the return of constructive dialogue with the prime minister"".
warned its huge Welsh steelworks could close unless there is a deal with the UK government to subsidise the cost of reducing carbon emissions.
Mr Sunak - who phoned the Welsh and Scottish first ministers on his first day in Downing Street - has said he wants the UK and devolved governments to ""work together in our shared interest"".
He and Mr Drakeford also discussed the ability of the Westminster parliament to intrude on devolved affairs.
Under what is known as the Sewel Convention, Westminster asks the Senedd for permission to legislate on policies that are normally controlled by Cardiff.
But it has been a source of tension and the Welsh government wants the convention to be legally binding.

politics	Rishi Sunak: What might the new Tory leader do as PM?	"Rishi Sunak is set to become the UK's next prime minister, after winning the race to replace Liz Truss as Conservative Party leader.
former chancellor did not make any policy pledges during the truncated four-day contest, or give any speeches or media interviews.
It means his unsuccessful battle against Ms Truss to replace Boris Johnson over the summer remains the best indication of his policies.
But after Ms Truss's tumultuous six-week premiership, big questions remain over his plans for office.
During the summer leadership contest, Mr Sunak dismissed Ms Truss's plans for instant tax cuts as ""fairytale"" economics that would push up inflation.
He cautioned that her plans risked higher government borrowing costs - a warning that resurfaced after financial turmoil following September's mini-budget did just that.
Although he said he wanted to see tax cuts in the long-term, he said bringing inflation first under control should be the priority.
As chancellor he raised National Insurance by 1.25p in the pound, a policy he defended throughout the campaign as necessary to fund health spending.
Following Ms Truss's mini-budget, the rise is due to be reversed on 6 November. Mr Sunak has not said whether this cut will still go ahead.
He also committed to raising corporation tax from 19% to 25% next April, a policy that remains on course after Ms Truss U-turned on her promise to scrap the rise.
One area where he did commit to cuts, however, was income tax - pledging to lower the basic rate by 4% before the end of the next parliament.
uded a 1% cut in April 2024, a reduction Ms Truss initially brought forward by a year before the commitment evaporated completely during her mini-budget U-turn.
How best to protect households and businesses from sky-high energy costs came to dominate the latter weeks of the summer leadership race.
Mr Sunak said he would scrap VAT on domestic energy bills for one year, a policy he had previously opposed as chancellor. He also said he would spend billions on further targeted relief for vulnerable groups. 
However, Ms Truss has since put in place a scheme to cap energy costs for both households and businesses, a policy predicted to cost £10bn a month.
me was originally due to run for two years - but as part of the U-turn on the mini-budget, will now be reviewed next April.
Whether to scale the programme back further, or replace it entirely, is one of the biggest decisions now confronting Mr Sunak as prime minister.
Over the summer, he did not follow Ms Truss in ruling out energy rationing this winter as part of plans to conserve supply.
Like his predecessor, however, he said he would resist solar panels being installed on ""our best farmland"" - and backed fracking for shale gas where it is supported by local residents.
He also said he was committed to the UK's target to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 
Health policy was not a key battleground during the summer campaign, but saw Mr Sunak make a number of important commitments.
w prime minister promised to eliminate one year waiting times by September 2024, and get the number of people waiting for non-urgent treatment in England falling by next year.
He pledged to do this by boosting the number of ""diagnostic hubs"" outside hospitals, including by repurposing empty High Street shops.
In a bid to reduce waste, he also said he would fine people £10 for missing a GP or hospital appointment.
He also pledged to reform dentists' NHS contract, and ringfence the annual £3bn NHS dentistry budget. 
ummer contest also saw Mr Sunak make a number of commitments on immigration, including keeping the UK's controversial scheme to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda. 
He also pledged to place an annual cap on the number of refugees the UK accepts, tighten asylum qualification criteria, and withhold aid from countries that won't take migrant returns.
Unlike Ms Truss, he did not pledge to raise defence spending to 3% of national income by 2030 - instead saying he wants the current 2% target to be seen as a floor.
On Brexit, another key area, Mr Sunak said he wanted to ""fix"" trading problems created by the Northern Ireland Protocol, and reform all EU laws still on the UK lawbook by the next general election."	/news/uk-politics-63374316
entertainment	Balenciaga campaign: Kim Kardashian 'shaken' by fashion house shoot	"Fashion house Balenciaga has been heavily criticised over a photoshoot showing child models posing with fetish-themed teddy bears.
It faced a huge backlash to the images, released as part of a campaign to promote its Objects range.
ressure on Kim Kardashian - an ambassador for the brand - who put out a statement in response. 
Balenciaga's removed the images and says it is taking action over one photoshoot.
Balenciaga is regarded as one of the ""world's hottest brands"" by some and its luxury goods are a favourite of A-listers and influencers.
But photos from two of its latest campaigns caused people to get angry.
first was a series of images showing child models posing with the company's plush bear bags.
r-inspired accessories look like soft toys - but appear to be wearing leather harnesses and other items associated with bondage fetishes.
wo of the pictures showed young children hugging the backpacks.
Critics then locked on to a second image from an earlier, separate, campaign promoting the brand's collaboration with Adidas.
One of the pictures showed a handbag sitting on top of some documents.
When people zoomed in on the text it revealed the papers were from a US Supreme Court ruling related to indecent images of children.
Balenciaga started posting the images to its social media feeds on 16 November.
rted to go viral, especially in the US among users who object to what they see as ""over-sexualising"" young children. 
As criticism built, a sarcastic tweet from YouTuber June Nicole Lapine gained a lot of traction and Balenciaga deleted all the images a short time later.
After this, some right-wing US media channels ran with the story, and accused the fashion house of ""endorsing child pornography"".
usation was fuelled by the campaign for its Adidas collaboration featuring the case notes referring to ""virtual child porn"".
Balenciaga posted an apology to its 14 million Instagram followers and said its plush bear bags ""should not have been featured with children"".
It said it had removed the items from sale and deleted the images from all web platforms.
Photographer Gabriele Galimberti - who shot the Objects campaign featuring the plush bear bags - also released a statement.
were supposed to mimic his Toy Stories series - photos of children around the world posing with their favourite things.
He told followers he had no control over the models or products used in the Balenciaga photos, and pointed out that they were not explicit.
Balenciaga also apologised for displaying ""unsettling documents"" in the Adidas collaboration campaign.
""The two separate ad campaigns in question reflect a series of grievous errors for which Balenciaga takes responsibility,"" it said.
mpany said it was carrying out investigations and strengthening checks and controls around its creative processes.
It added: ""We want to learn from our mistakes and identify ways we can contribute.""
Gabriele Galimberti also pointed out that he was not connected to the Adidas photoshoot.
Kim Kardashian was also criticised over the images - or, rather, for staying silent about them.
reality star is an ambassador for the brand and the two regularly work together - but she did not comment on the scandal until Sunday.
Posting to her Instagram stories and Twitter, she said she had been ""shaken by the disturbing images"" and ""any attempts to normalize child abuse of any kind should have no place in our society — period.""
She said her silence was not down to a lack of disgust and outrage, but because she wanted to speak to Balenciaga to ""understand for myself how this could have happened.""
Commending the brand for removing the campaigns and apologising, she said she was ""re-evaluating"" her relationship with the company.
But she told followers she believed the brand understood the seriousness of the issue and it would take steps to make sure it would ""never happen again"".

sports	Commonwealth Games: Was Birmingham 2022 Scotland's best-ever Games?	"The bare statistics say Birmingham 2022 was Scotland's second best Commonwealth Games ever. Scratch a little deeper and it might just be the best.
Scots finished with 51 medals, including 13 golds - two marks bettered only by the 53 and 19 won at Glasgow 2014. Add their 11 silver and 27 bronze and they end up sixth in the medal table.
But what of the detail hidden beneath those headlines? Did you know these Games were Scotland's most successful in the velodrome? That no meet has yielded more aquatics medal? That athletics enjoyed their largest haul in 40 years?
Neither did BBC Scotland until we delved deeper into the results of a frantic 11 days of competition. Here's what we've discovered...
Exceedingly well. Granted, the overall haul and tally of golds sits just shy of those gathered in Glasgow, but it's worth considering a few factors before making such a crude determination.
Obviously, being at home was significant, but 2014 also had the largest number of athletes Scotland has ever had at a Games with 313. Lop 50-odd off that amount for Birmingham and pitch is suddenly skewed.
In fact, it goes from one medal every 5.30 athletes in Glasgow to one for every 5.07 this summer. A small, but significant, improvement.
So Birmingham 2022 comfortably eclipsed every other Games outside Scotland's largest city, but could it have been even better? Indisputably yes.
Nowhere was this better exemplified that in the travails of diver James Heatly. He finished fourth in two individual events, as well as the men's synchro, before finally winning mixed synchro gold on the final morning of competition.
His were among 16 fourth-place finishes for Scottish athletes, some by the most agonisingly narrow of margins. 
A different bounce, step or lunge might have elevated those to medal-winning performances, just as it might have done for the 29 athletes who came fifth or even the 21 who were sixth in their events.
Yes, there was. Both in terms of different sports, different genders and different abilities.
Of the 19 disciplines in which Scots were entered, 10 yielded medals. That included record hauls in swimming and cycling, a first rhythmic gymnastics podium, and a sweep of the Para-bowls as Scotland claimed medals in five of the six Para-sports.
For the first time, the team comprised more women than men (134:125) and around 43% of the medals earned were claimed by female athletes, with Eilish McColgan's 5,000m silver Scotland's 500th Games medal.
Swimmer Duncan Scott, unsurprisingly. The six-time Olympic medallist claimed six in Birmingham to become Scotland's most decorated Commonwealth Games athlete.
25-year-old not only matched shooter Alister Allan's mark of 10 medals earned between 1974 and 1994, but he also ripped the record from the 78-year-old and nudged it on to 12 in a stellar showing. 
But Scott was not the only multiple medallist. Pool-mate Ross Murdoch and cyclist Neah Evans claimed three. Neil Fachie, Jack Carlin and Aileen McGlynn grabbed a couple each in the velodrome. As did Laura Muir and Eilish McColgan on the track. 
And Katie Shanahan, plus relay swimmers Stephen Milne and Evan Jones, claimed two each in the water."	/sport/commonwealth-games/62453252

But the line has hardened that more money is not available. 
re is a fear in parts of Whitehall that if the pay demands of one sector are accepted, everyone else will want the same.
may sound reasonable to some, but ministers believe is it unaffordable and could lead to an inflationary spiral.
So what do they do?
Well, part of the battle is for hearts and minds.
When it comes to transport strikes by the RMT union, the government strategy appears to be to hope that the public turns against them.
Cabinet ministers believe that may have started to happen in response to recently-announced strikes over Christmas. 
rgument, but some in government believes it weakens the hand of the unions.
It is not guaranteed to work - the RMT are keen to sell their message to the public too.
And it becomes a lot harder when it comes to NHS staff, who helped get the country through the darkest days of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Ministers are not going to budge on pay demands they regard as too high - but there is an acknowledgement in government that the public have a lot more sympathy for nurses and ambulance staff struggling with the cost of living. 
Some MPs want ministers to make one-off payments to help with current pressures. 
Watch: RMT chief Mick Lynch says union forced into Christmas strike action
What is noticeable is how the government's rhetoric on strikes  - and possibly its response, too - has hardened in a short space of time.
On Tuesday. Downing Street said that while they kept matters under review, there were no plans to extend embryonic legislation on minimum service levels on strike days beyond the transport sector.
wenty four hours on - and after action by ambulance crews was announced -  No 10 has confirmed that minimum service levels will be imposed in other parts of the public sector.
re yet to specify exactly where. They promise - or threaten - details ""shortly"".
Policy options are apparently being worked on within the Cabinet Office under Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Oliver Dowden.
And No 10 would not even rule out - at this stage - a ban on strike action amongst those emergency workers who currently allowed to take industrial action, such as ambulance crews.
Sources acknowledge that no new measures would be in place to mitigate the effects of the pre-Christmas strikes.
No timescale is being given but signalling a willingness to ""get tough"" may mollify angry Conservative backbenchers and usually supportive newspapers, while also drawing a dividing line with Labour, which will oppose new trade union laws and repeal many existing ones.
But perhaps sensing at least a diminution of public support for industrial action as the scale of strikes increases, a strategy of sorts appears to be emerging.
ummed up as not budging on inflation-proof pay increases; threatening tougher laws if the expected strike action goes ahead; actual legislation to curb a similar scale of strikes in future and contingency plans to deal with the current action.
PCS union says the government is training army personnel to stand in for striking border force staff and while there has been no formal request from the health department for military support in the ambulance dispute, informal discussions have already been held."	/news/uk-politics-63893158
health	Antibiotic supply gone from bad to worse, say pharmacists	"Pharmacists say supplies of key antibiotics to treat strep A have ""gone from bad to worse"" in the past week.
Association of Independent Multiple Pharmacies (AIMP) said the situation was ""unacceptable"" and it was time for the government to get a plan in place.
Four antibiotics, which treat different conditions, have been added to a list of products that the UK cannot export.
UK government says it is working urgently with manufacturers and wholesalers to speed up deliveries.
However, Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the AIMP, which represents 4,000 pharmacies in the UK, said the supply of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections including strep A and scarlet fever was ""very poor"".
She said the problem had been highlighted a week ago, but it was now getting worse, making it very difficult to get hold of any antibiotics.
""People are having to go from one pharmacy to another - it's chaos,"" she said.
""Supplies are not coming through to us and it feels like no-one cares.""
Dr Hannbeck said putting four antibiotics - three of which are go-to treatments for strep A - on the banned UK export list because of high demand was ""too little too late"". 
Amoxicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V), azithromycin oral suspension and cefalexin are used to treat a large range of bacterial infections, including throat, chest and skin infections.
Her message to worried parents is that pharmacists are working very hard to find alternatives, and also changing formulations from solid pills to liquid medicines.
But even the alternatives are running short, Dr Hannbeck says.
A spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care said manufacturers currently have supplies of antibiotics to treat strep A and they are trying to get that stock to pharmacies.
""We continue to work urgently with manufacturers and wholesalers to expedite deliveries, bring forward stock they have to help ensure it gets to where it's needed and boost supply to meet demand as quickly as possible, and support access to these vital medicines,"" they said.
GPs have been advised to prescribe antibiotics for children who may have worsening symptoms linked to strep A, a bacterial infection which can lead to scarlet fever and, very rarely, a serious and fatal invasive infection called iGAS.
Strep A: What you need to know, in a minute
Strep A infections tend to increase in the winter and peak in the spring, but this year cases are rising at an earlier point than usual - probably because of changes in the normal cycle of infections due to the pandemic.
Since September, 15 children in the UK have died after severe iGAS infections, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Figures for England show that 45 adults have also died from the same condition in the same period.
ghest number of deaths since the winter of 2017-18, when 27 children and 328 adults died with invasive strep A.
rade body which represents drug wholesalers, the Healthcare Distribution Association (HDA), said more stock of antibiotics was being delivered into warehouses now and would be with pharmacies in the coming days.
Martin Sawer, executive director of the HDA, said one national wholesaler had told him that demand for medicines had risen by 400-500% on last December.
""We are prioritising all the antibiotics amid huge demand for them, particularly liquid solutions,"" he said.
Pharmacists also say they are being charged up to £19 for a pack of drugs that normally costs a few pounds, after prices went up sharply amid a rise in cases of strep A.
As a result, they say they are losing thousands of pounds a week because only a fraction of what the drugs cost can be recouped from the NHS.
Competition and Markets Authority is now investigating the pricing of antibiotics by drug companies. It says it wants companies to be clear about their legal obligations.
""There should be no doubt that it is illegal for a dominant company to charge excessive prices, or for any companies to collude to drive up prices,"" the CMA said.

entertainment	Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas is You copyright case dropped	"Singer Mariah Carey is no longer being sued for copyright infringement over her hit song All I Want for Christmas is You, after country singer Andy Stone dropped his legal action.
Songwriter Mr Stone sued the popstar in June, claiming he co-wrote a song with the same name five years earlier.
He told the court he would dismiss the case - but legally he could refile it.
A must-have on any festive playlist, Carey's mega-hit is one of the best known Christmas records of all time.
Mr Stone, who performs under the name Vince Vance with the band Vince Vance and the Valiants, previously filed the lawsuit in a New Orleans federal court - where he also filed to have the case dismissed.
He was claiming at least $20m (£16m) in damages, arguing that Carey exploited his ""popularity"" and ""style"".
Despite sharing a title, the two songs are musically different, but Mr Stone claimed that Carey did not ask for permission to use the song name and had earned ""undeserved profits"" from it. 
It is not unusual for different songs to have the same name, and the United States Copyright Office lists 177 entries on its website under the title All I Want for Christmas is You.
Since appearing on the album Merry Christmas in 1994, the song has topped the charts in several countries and by 2017 had reportedly earned Carey more than $60m (£48m) in royalties.
It has been streamed over one billion times on Spotify.
In a recent memoir, Carey admitted to composing ""most of the song on a cheap little Casio keyboard"".

politics	Six month delay to Scottish short-term lets licensing scheme	"which hosts of short-term lets in Scotland need to get a licence has been delayed by six months.
me, which could see fines of up to £2,500 imposed on people who rent out property without permission, was set up by the government in October.
It is aimed at reducing the impact of Airbnb-style lets on local communities and the availability of housing.
Hosts had until 31 March 2023 to apply for a licence, but this has now been pushed back until the start of October.
Housing Secretary Shona Robison said the ""one-off"" extension was agreed due to the impact of the cost-of-living crisis, but stressed that hosts should continue to apply.
Hospitality groups had raised concerns about the impact of the proposals on the tourism sector, particularly over the summer in Edinburgh when many people travel to the city for the annual festivals.
g scheme was set up in a bid to ensure consistent safety standards across short-term lets, as well as making sure hosts are fit and proper people and giving councils more control over the number of rentals.
Some areas, such as Edinburgh and the Highlands, see a large number of properties let out on a short-term basis, leading to concerns about a lack of housing for permanent residents and some complaints about anti-social behaviour and noise.
Applications to the scheme - which are handled by local authorities - were opened in October, and new hosts have to obtain a licence before they can operate a rental.
Existing hosts were given a deadline of 31 March 2023 to apply, but Ms Robison confirmed in a letter to Holyrood's housing committee that this has now been pushed back to 30 September.
She said: ""This is a one-off six month extension, which recognises the wider economic circumstances of the cost-of-living crisis that is placing pressure on existing short-term let hosts and businesses.
""This is not a pause and we encourage hosts to continue to apply throughout this period. It will not make any changes in our primary aim of ensuring all short-term lets across Scotland meet consistent safety standards and are provided by fit and proper people.""
Association of Scotland's Self-Caterers welcomed the move.
Chief executive Fiona Campbell said: ""The ASSC has been pressing hard for a pause to the implementation of the scheme due to the cost-of-living crisis so it's good to know our voices are being heard.
""Our ongoing concern however is that it is not long enough to give our members the breathing space they need to get their licence applications approved in the current climate.""
UK Short Term Accommodation Association (STAA) said the scheme could have a damaging effect on Scotland's tourism economy.
CEO Andy Fenner said:  ""We are pleased that the Scottish government has made its decision for a six month delay.  
""We have heard from the likes of the Edinburgh Festival that its future could be severely compromised because this licensing scheme will effectively limit the amount of accommodation on offer.""
Councils also have a separate power to set up short-term rental control zones, where hosts would need to get planning permission in order to let out a property."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63916032

entertainment	Eurovision scraps jury voting in semi-finals	"Eurovision Song Contest has announced major changes to the voting process at next year's contest.
Professional juries have been scrapped from the semi-finals, meaning that viewers alone will choose who qualifies for the grand final.
Countries who are not competing in the contest will also be allowed to cast votes for the first time.
move comes after it was discovered that six juries traded votes at this year's contest in Turin, Italy.
Irregular voting patterns were detected from Azerbaijan, Georgia, Montenegro, Poland, Romania and San Marino, said the EBU, which organises the contest.
jury votes were discounted, and substituted with an aggregate score, calculated from the results of other countries with similar voting records.
In the end, the contest was won by Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra, with the UK's Sam Ryder taking second place.
Liverpool will host the event in 2023.
Professional juries, which comprise professional songwriters and music industry figures, have existed since at least the second Eurovision Song Contest in 1957 (the voting system for the first competition has never been revealed).
Under the current system, their scores are combined with the results of a public vote to determine the overall winner. 
ractice will continue in the final, said the EBU in a press release.
V presenter Nicki Chapman, who has served on the UK jury twice, welcomed the change, saying fans often know more than the professionals.
""There'll be lots of people breathing a sigh of relief, because real Eurovision fans are online months and months in advance. They know every single song, and they'll have their favourites.
""So when Ireland gets knocked out, for example, so many people are disappointed. This [change] gives everybody the chance to put their favourite through and, when it comes to the final, the juries will have 50% of the votes.""
Allowing non-participating countries to vote will reflect ""the global impact of the event,"" said Martin Österdahl, the contest's executive supervisor.
""Everyone watching the show, wherever they live in the world, can cast their votes for their favourite songs.""
Online votes from the ""rest of the world"" will be added together and converted to points that will have the same weight as one participating country in both of the semi-finals and the grand final, the EBU said.
""I love the idea it's going to go global,"" said Chapman, who worked with David Bowie, the Spice Girls and Amy Winehouse before moving into television.
""I wonder whether, say an artist such as Adele might suddenly think, 'Actually, I want to be part of this. This goes out to a global audience, I want to represent the UK'. Wouldn't that be wonderful?""
In the past, Eurovision viewers have frequently voted in opposition to the juries. This year,for example, Ukraine overwhelmingly won the tele-vote at the final, scoring 439 points, but came fourth in the jury vote, with 192.
Sam Ryder, meanwhile, was the jury members' favourite act, scoring 283 points, but came fifth with viewers at home.
rty-seven countries will take place in next year's contest, with Montenegro and North Macedonia pulling out due to the cost of participating.
Russia was expelled from this year's event after its invasion of Ukraine; and its suspension will continue in 2023.

politics	Proposal to keep MPs charged with violent or sexual offences away from Parliament	"MPs charged with violent or sexual offences would be banned from setting foot in the House of Commons, under new proposals.
If the plans are approved, any MP charged with these offences would need to stay away from the building until their case has concluded.
It would apply to MPs charged by police, not accused via media reports or Parliament's complaints system. 
ultation comes after fresh sexual misconduct claims against MPs.
ude a senior Conservative MP who is facing allegations of rape and sexual assault who, as first reported by The Sun newspaper, was reported to the police by Tory MP colleagues on 28 October.
unnamed MP still has the Conservative whip, meaning they can represent the party in Parliament. 
Conservative party chairman Nadhim Zahawi said on Sunday the party would act if police opened an investigation into the MP. 
Mr Zahawi said he was made aware of the allegations when he became party chairman in October.
He said he had immediately commissioned independent legal advice in addition to the advice from the party's in-house lawyers.
""If there is an investigation by the police, then we will obviously take action,"" he told Times Radio.
""But at the moment, I'm waiting for the legal advice on safeguarding on this. It's right to do this properly.""
In a statement, the Met said it had received allegations via a third party of ""serious sexual assault"" on 28 October and that officers were ""making inquiries"" into the allegations. 
It said the allegations were reported to have taken place on unknown dates at undisclosed locations. 
Mike Clancy, general secretary of Prospect, one of the unions that represent Parliamentary staff, said: ""The report that another MP has been accused of sexual offences raises important questions as to who knew what when, and what have they done about it.
""This MP remains free to visit the House of Commons and interact with staff despite these very serious allegations. This highlights yet again that there is no fit-for-purpose process in place to deal with this type of case and make Parliament a safe place to work."" 
We spoke to a former Parliamentary staff member who complained about an MP's behaviour through Parliament's Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), on condition of anonymity. 
was ""very concerning and damaging to see somebody who you have complained about walking around the estate especially if there is a sexual misconduct element to it"". 
MP they complained about was later found by an independent panel to have sexually harassed the staff member. 
When asked if the proposed ban should go further than MPs charged by police, they said those accused through the complaints scheme ""are still very much a threat to the safeguarding of staff"". 
""So it does show a disregard towards our safety and staff welfare not to exclude someone who has been accused of sexual misconduct [through the ICGS] from the estate,"" they added. 
""I know for a fact both me and quite a lot of other people would have felt a lot more comfortable if the person I complained about wasn't on the estate."" 
Parliament's priority ""should be the safety and welfare of staff, not the protection of the reputation of an MP"", they said. 
Separately, a different Conservative MP was arrested in May on suspicion of rape and sexual assault. 
In May, the Met Police said a man, aged in his 50s, was arrested on suspicion of indecent assault, sexual assault, rape, abuse of position of trust and misconduct in public office.
unnamed MP was taken into custody earlier this year and has been bailed pending further enquiries. 
It came after the Met received a report in January 2020 relating to alleged sexual offences having been committed between 2002-09 in London. 
Last week, the MP had his bail date extended until mid-February 2023 having previously been set for mid-November. 
gation into this MP is ongoing, led by officers from the Met Police's Central Specialist Crime team. 
When the MP was arrested earlier this year, the Conservative Whips office, which is responsible for party discipline, confirmed they had asked the MP to stay away from parliament during the investigation.
House of Commons Commission are consulting people who work in the building on their proposals, which include:
Commons Commission proposals would not apply if evidence of serious sexual or violent misconduct emerged in the media, through the ICGS, or if an individual was arrested but not charged. 
ral reasons for this, including their desire to protect the anonymity of individuals who have not been charged with any offence.
rliamentary authorities emphasised that cases that result in charges are ""rare"".
""Within the last six years there have been two Members charged with and convicted of sexual assault; and one convicted of harassment with threats of violence,"" the Commission said in its consultation document. 
""On several occasions, Members arrested or alleged to be under investigation for sexual offences have agreed voluntarily not to attend the estate. That voluntary commitment has not always been honoured. It has also been unclear whether it applies to Parliamentary-funded travel."" 
rgue that while some workplaces would take precautionary action if there is a ""reasonable suspicion"" that an employee has engaged in violent behaviour, MPs are not employees of the House of Commons so their options to respond to such cases are more limited. "	/news/uk-politics-63874606
health	Cavell Centre: 'Profound sense of fear' felt among staff	"A ""profound sense of fear"" existed among staff at an NHS mental health unit where leadership was described as dictatorial, a report has found.
An internal review into the culture of the Cavell Centre, in Peterborough, found staff who spoke up felt ""ostracised and alienated"".
It added that ""staff likened the Cavell Centre to a school playground where the school bully operates"".
NHS trust said it was ""deeply shocked and saddened by the findings"".
unit, run by Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Trust (CPFT), provides inpatient mental health care and specialist learning disability services.
CPFT commissioned the review in November 2021, but the reviewers said many of those they interviewed ""were extremely anxious"" about taking part, and were in fear of being identified.
Released to the BBC under the Freedom of Information Act after a request in September, the review said: ""A cyclical theme within the culture of the Cavell Centre was reported as autocratic, dictatorial, insular, and hierarchical."" 
It found that behaviour by ""key people in the hierarchy"" led to ""acts that could reasonably constitute bullying or harassment"".
Reviewers heard ""very distressing testimony relating to sexuality, of staff being confronted with extremely offensive and discriminatory messages"".
Other findings included claims of racism from both white and non-white staff, and concerns care was being compromised because of a culture of nurse-led, rather than consultant-led, decision-making.
Staff also described it as ""a place bereft of hope or enthusiasm"", and public humiliation ""came across as a norm of leadership"".
Reviewers, who conducted interviews between January and May, said staff ""required multiple reassurances that speaking with the reviewers was safe and confidential"". 
""The profound sense of fear expressed by some staff was tangible and real,"" the review said.
""Many explained how they or their colleagues had been ostracised and alienated for doing so, feeling that the only solution was to leave.""
In October, the same month the review was published, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspected the Cavell Centre and four wards at Fulbourn Hospital as part of an inspection into CPFT's acute wards for adults of working age and psychiatric intensive care.
In May, an inspection of one of those Fulbourn wards - prompted by an allegation of sexual assault - led to the CQC serving the trust a warning notice, which has been lifted since the most recent inspection.
But this inspection, in direct contrast to the trust's own review, also said ""staff felt respected, supported and valued... they could raise any concerns without fear"".
CQC said it had spoken to 11 staff across the five units and was ""satisfied the culture did not undermine patient safety"". 
But it added: ""After our inspection concluded, the trust made us aware of the independent review and it subsequently shared the associated report. 
""We are taking up the issues the review raises with the trust to seek assurances these concerns do not undermine the quality or safety of patient care.""
Anna Hills, CPFT chief executive, said: ""We commissioned the cultural review in response to concerns from our staff and are deeply shocked and saddened by the findings.
""I would like to thank colleagues who bravely came forward to speak up and I am truly sorry for what they have experienced.
""Since receiving the report we have spent time listening to and talking with staff, and together we are co-designing the next steps.
""The trust board is fully committed to addressing the issues raised.""
With respect to the CQC inspection she was ""pleased [it] acknowledged the improvements that have already taken place"", adding: ""We recognise there is still work to do but I am so very proud of the dedication of our staff.""

health	Grace Victory reunites with doctor after Covid coma cardiac arrest	"A YouTuber who went into cardiac arrest while in a coma with Covid has reunited with the doctor who saved her life.
Grace Victory, 31, from High Wycombe, was put in a coma on Boxing Day 2020, just after giving birth to her son.
Dr Viv Sathianathan was the lead consultant on shift when she went into cardiac arrest three weeks later.
Ms Victory, who is also an author, said she felt privileged returning to Northwick Park Hospital in London to give a talk with him for trainee staff.
""It was an honour to talk with Dr Viv about the good and the bad from my 98-day stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and to give advice on things that could be improved upon from a patient perspective,"" she said.
""Dr Viv said my heart stopped beating whilst I was laying on my front, which is literally a worst-case scenario, but he and a team of 10 nurses and doctors brought me back to life. And because of them I am here. Alive, breathing, living, thriving.""
Dr Sathianathan, clinical lead for intensive care medicine, said: ""We are all extremely pleased that Grace has made such an impressive recovery.
""We always strive to learn and improve and it was really informative to hear Grace talk to the team about the good and the bad during her time with us.""
Ms Victory, who was in a coma for three months, said the pair also spoke about the need for better psychological support for ICU patients and staff traumatised by the pandemic. She hopes to work on this idea with the charity Mind, for which she is an ambassador.
When the vlogger woke up in March 2021, she was finally able to meet her 10-week-old son Cyprus Sevyn for the first time. 
He was born by emergency C-section on Christmas Eve 2020, when Ms Victory was seven months pregnant, because she was so sick with coronavirus. 
Doctors have been amazed by her recovery, she said, after they initially only gave her a 5% chance of survival.
Ms Victory is now pregnant with her second child, a little girl, and is due to give birth next month.
""I'm now focusing on birth prep, relaxation and spending time with my bestie Cyprus Sevyn. I feel as if a chapter is closing and a new one is beginning and I could not be more excited,"" she added.

health	Covid in China: People rush to book travel as borders finally reopen	"Chinese people have rushed to book overseas travel after Beijing announced it would reopen its borders next month.
Passport applications for Chinese citizens wishing to travel internationally will resume from 8 January, the immigration administration said.
It follows an announcement on Monday that ended almost three years of strict quarantine rules for arrivals.
ravel sites have since reported a spike in traffic.
But Chinese tourists will not have unfettered access to all countries.
Officials in the US are considering new restrictions on travellers from China due to concerns about a surge in cases and a lack of transparency from the Chinese government.
""There are mounting concerns in the international community on the ongoing Covid-19 surges in China and the lack of transparent data, including viral genomic sequence data,"" US officials said in a statement quoted by news agencies.
""Without this data, it is becoming increasingly difficult for public health officials to ensure that they will be able to identify any potential new variants and take prompt measures to reduce the spread.""
Japan - one of the most popular destinations for Chinese travellers - has announced that all travellers from China must show a negative Covid test on arrival, or quarantine for seven days, because of the surge in cases there.
India has also said travellers from China (as well as some other countries) must show a negative Covid test when they arrive - though this was announced before Beijing's easing of restrictions.
g of travel rules in China - the last part of the country's zero-Covid policy - comes as the country battles a new wave of infections.
Resentment against the government's policy - which sparked rare public protests against President Xi Jinping in November - led to a relaxation of Covid restrictions across the country.
But an increase in Covid cases followed, with reports of hospitals overwhelmed and a shortage of drugs.
uncement on outbound travel on Tuesday came after Monday's news, which axed quarantine rules for travellers arriving in China. It also scrapped a cap on the daily number of flights.
On the same day, the National Health Commission announced that Covid would be formally downgraded to a Class B infectious disease on 8 January.
Before the relaxation of travel rules, people were strongly discouraged from travelling abroad. The sale of outbound group and package travel was banned, according to marketing solutions company Dragon Trail International.
Within half an hour of Monday's notice that China's borders would reopen, data from travel site Trip.com - cited in Chinese media - showed searches for popular destinations had increased ten-fold year-on-year. 
Macau, Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand and South Korea were the most popular destinations.
In addition, Chinese travel agency Qunar saw flight enquiries on its website increase seven-fold within the first 15 minutes after the announcement, the China Daily reports.
Before the pandemic, the number of outbound tourists from China stood at 155 million in 2019, according to Statista. This number dropped to 20 million in 2020.
r, some people in China will hope to visit family and loved ones during Chinese New Year, which begins on 22 January.
But inside China, there has been a mixed reaction.
""I'm happy about it but also speechless. If we're doing this [reopening] anyway - why did I have to suffer all the daily Covid tests and lockdowns this year?"" said Rachel Liu, who lives in Shanghai.
She said she had endured three months of lockdown in April - but nearly everyone in her family had become infected in recent weeks.
She said her parents, grandparents and partner - living across three different cities in Xi'an, Shanghai and Hangzhou - had all come down with fever last week.
Many have also expressed concern online about borders reopening as Covid cases peak.
""Why can't we wait until this wave passes to open up? The medical workers are already worn out, and old people won't survive two infections in one month,"" read one top-liked comment on Weibo.
People in cities like Beijing and Shanghai, which experience chilly temperatures in the winter, say they're running out of flu and cold medicine. 
It's feared that hundreds of deaths may be going unreported as crematoriums are overwhelmed. 
In the capital, Beijing, authorities say they are planning to distribute the Pfizer tablets, Paxlovid, in order to try to reduce the severity of infections. But health centres contacted by The Global Times on Monday said the drug had yet to be delivered.
On Monday, President Xi issued his first remarks on the changes, calling on officials to do what was ""feasible"" to save lives.
China's about-turn has put Mr Xi in a tough spot. He was the driving force behind zero-Covid, which many blamed for restricting people's lives excessively and crippling the economy. 
But having abandoned it, analysts say he now has to take responsibility for the huge wave of infections and hospital admissions. Many have questioned why the country was not better prepared.

business	Anglesey: Shop hit by bridge closure demands financial help	"Businesses affected by the closure of one of two bridges between Anglesey and the mainland ""need financial support now"", a shop owner has said.  
Menai suspension bridge was shut to all traffic last month over safety concerns.
A pet shop owner said it had left some businesses on the island ""on the brink of closing"".
Welsh government said free parking and new traffic flows would cut congestion on the remaining road link.
Lee Waters, the Welsh government's deputy minister for climate change, said: ""We understand people's frustrations and the inconvenience and disruption caused to the local community.
""The consequences of (the bridge) failing would be catastrophic, so we're putting people's safety first.""
Hauliers have called the closure a ""nightmare"", while businesses have reported a drop in trade. 
Mr Waters will announce free parking in the town of Menai Bridge from 1 December to support shops, cafes and businesses, while traffic flow changes to reduce pressure on the only open road link - the Britannia Bridge - would be made. 
Lesley Jones from Pip's Pet Supplies in Benllech told BBC Radio Wales Anglesey council normally offers free parking in December to help small businesses.
""I don't really understand what [the] measures... are actually offering businesses,"" she said. ""We need financial support now. During Covid we had 100% rebate on our rates. We are not being offered anything like that.""
Since the bridge closure, Ms Jones said, the high street had been ""empty"". 
""It was like someone literally switching a light switch off,"" she explained. ""We have no contingency funds... some businesses are on the brink of closing.""
Mr Waters said free parking would encourage people on Anglesey to do their Christmas shopping on the island.
""We're hoping the effects will be for a very brief period, and that by the end of January, the bridge can be reopened,"" he added. 
Britannia Bridge will also get extra bus stops, so users can walk across if there is a traffic jam.
under-repair Menai suspension bridge will be opened to police, fire and ambulance service in cases of a life-threatening emergency. 
""We have been working closely with the organisation which maintains the bridges - UK Highways A55 Ltd - as well as Anglesey council and Cyngor Gwynedd (Gwynedd council) to introduce these measures,"" Mr Waters said. 
""They will help alleviate people's concerns and ensure disruption is kept to a minimum as essential work continues on the Menai suspension bridge."" 
But Ms Jones said the plan to get Menai suspension bridge open again was still unclear. 
""The times I've been passing, I've certainly not seen any action on the bridge so we don't know,"" she said. ""We certainly need a light at the end of the tunnel, at the moment its just darkness. 
""We don't know if it will be closed a month, a year, we just have no idea,"" she added. ""It's so important that communication is given by the powers that be so we can at least put a plan in place to see if we can survive this.""  
Plaid Cymru MS for Ynys Môn, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said his constituents had also expressed frustration about a ""lack of communication"". 
""We're told work will begin 'soon', that the bridge will reopen 'early in the new year', that help is being 'considered' for business, and that 'options' for traffic alleviation are being studied,"" he said. 
""It's not good enough and in the absence of actual news and regular updates, people will assume nothing's happening.""
r of Anglesey Council, Llinos Medi, said she was ""pleased"" to see the support measures introduced.
""We are currently analysing the results from a recent online survey shared with local businesses, which will enable us to continue working with Welsh government on further support, if needed,"" she said. 
Ms Medi stressed the town of Menai Bridge is ""very much open for business"" and she encouraged ""residents and visitors to visit... and support local businesses in the area"".
Menai suspension bridge during October showed a problem with its hangars - metal rods that drop down from the suspension chains and hold the road deck in place.
It was found they could snap if several heavy vehicles had to do an emergency stop on the bridge at the same time."	/news/uk-wales-63800947

sports	Running with the Hadza - the race celebrating a way of life	"A fire crackles just after dawn in north Tanzania's bushlands. The sun is starting to rise over the Yaeda Valley and the start of a new day means one thing for the Hadza tribe. It's time to begin their daily ritual of finding the food that will sustain them until next sunrise.
For the women, this means heading out with long wooden sticks to forage for berries and dig for edible tubers. For the men, it's a time to hunt. With handmade bows and arrows, they will cover up to 40km on foot by midday.
In the summer of 2023 a group of ultra-marathon runners will arrive on Hadza land for an 80km race. Competitors will use Hadza survival skills to sustain themselves.
re will be no feed zones or energy gels. Runners won't be allowed to bring supplies. Water will have to be gathered from natural rainwater cisterns in baobab trees while the trees' fruit will be among their energy sources.
Hadza tribe have been living this way in this region for thousands of years. They are one of the world's few remaining hunter-gatherer tribes. They live sustainably day-to-day off their native land in the Yaeda Valley, don't hoard food or resources and have no history of famine.
However, their population has diminished to 1,300 because of encroachment from pastoral tribes and farming settlements. They have lost 90% of their land since the 1960s.
""When I was a child there were no other tribes in the area up to 80km from here,"" tribe elder Maroba says as he sits on a rock overlooking the valley.
""The game that was here then - everything from elephant, giraffe, zebra, wildebeest - was plentiful for hunting. Slowly that changed and people started moving in.""
race will take place during the dry season, when the landscape looks barren and unforgiving. But the Hadza women emphasise there is an abundance of food if you know where to look. During a morning forage, Apooa shows us a greyish looking branch that signals there are edible tubers underneath. She says: ""We're digging for makalitako and this food will sustain us until this evening.""
Early the next morning we're about to experience first-hand some of the course with two tribe members, Moshi and Sindano.
Hadza are an entirely egalitarian society in relation to gender and age. However, there's a definite hierarchy in the expertise in our running group.
With a bow and arrow in one hand and the other in his pocket, Moshi is moving fast over rocky, uneven, hilly terrain with Sindano, alert to any potential hunting opportunity. You've got to run to keep up.
Earlier that morning, the route of next year's race was explained to Moshi by Mika Peterson, our guide and translator from the Dorobo Fund,external-link a conservation arm of Dorobo Safaris that works with the Hadza to retain land rights. He will work with ultra-marathon expert Josue Stephens and his company Barefoot Adventures to organise the race, which doesn't have a name yet.
Hadza don't use kilometres or miles. Mika - switching between Swahili and the Hadza's click language, Hadzane - explains the route using well-known Hadza landmarks.
""Researchers have put trackers on Hadza people and it is very common for a Hadza to go off hunting and do 30 or 40km in a morning,"" says Daudi Peterson, Mika's father, who has been working with the Hadza since the 1990s.
Race organiser Stephens has spent extended periods of his life running with the Tarahuma tribe in Mexico, subject of the best-selling book Born to Run by Christopher McDougall. He was drawn to organising a race with the Hadza in part by their athlete-like endurance.
Studies have shown that a typical Hadza tribe member completes the UK's recommended weekly guidance for exercise - 150 minutes - every day. They have also found the Hadza have enviable heart health, with low blood pressure and cholesterol levels, even in old age.
Some members of the Hadza group tell us they would like to do the race, with Mika adding: ""Someone like Moshi, we'll probably ask to stay near the back to help anyone who is struggling.""
It will be a tough course for the 50 to 100 racers expected to compete.
Eighty kilometres in temperatures over 30C at 1,300m altitude (the same as the UK's highest mountain Ben Nevis) will be difficult enough. The racers will also forage for wild berries, dig for tubers, hand-make arrows, harvest honey and climb the baobab trees for water and fruit.
""For the racers, those challenges are going to take a really long time, but I am going to be able to do them really quickly,"" Moshi says.
You can spot the ubiquitous baobab trees from any vantage point in the valley. Their thick trunks give them the appearance of water hydrants. 
known across Africa as the tree of life and for good reason. It's one of the world's largest succulents and can store more than 100,000 litres of water during the rainy season. Its citrus fruit is a well known superfood with six times more vitamin C than an orange.
Mika says: ""The baobab will be the main sustaining food for the race. Racers cannot bring any of their own food and will have to obtain food and drink with skills they learn from the Hadza.""
Midway through a morning hunt on our penultimate day in the valley we stopped to practise our baobab harvesting skills (also known as throwing sticks to knock the fruit off its branches). Moshi is again at the fore, laughing, smiling and teaching us the traditional Hadza hello.
'Am I yega' translates as 'are you alive?'
Earlier, Moshi had been smoking out killer bees from their hive for honey. It took him minutes to make a small fire, using the friction from branches in a hand-drill technique and dried grass as kindling. Racers will also have to master this for roasting tubers and warmth at night.
Just to the right of us is a piece of wood painted white on one side and green on the other. It's about a metre high and is a boundary marker.
flaking paint draws the lines of Hadza territory and marks where pastoral Datoga tribes are allowed on to Hadza land at certain times of year for cattle grazing.
Some of the race proceeds will be paid directly to the Hadza, for use of their land and the sharing of their survival skills. They spend money on healthcare, education and settling land disputes. They have lived in this region for tens of thousands of years, but only since 2003 has their traditional territory been officially assigned to them under Tanzanian law.
On our final afternoon with the Hadza, we spent some time sitting on a huge rock overlooking the Yaeda Valley with Maroba. Asked how the valley has changed in his lifetime, Maroba began a long story, his arms pointing in various directions as he explained the different areas on the horizon, which used to be Hadza land.
When he had finished talking, we asked how he felt about the encroaching rival tribes.
He smiled and, with characteristic Hadza compassion, says: ""It's become a lot harder to be able to live off the land than when I was a child.
""The increase of people and pressure, even if we do have these designated areas that have some kind of protection, make it so hard to hunt. The way it is going is not looking too pretty, but those people need to make a living as well."""	/sport/63958092
politics	Vote delay reopens Conservative divisions over housing	"A backbench rebellion over the government's housebuilding plans has reopened Conservative divisions over housing targets.
Nearly 50 rebels are backing a plan to ban mandatory targets in England, prompting ministers to delay a vote scheduled for Monday.
rebels argue government-set targets are excessive and undermine local councils.
But other Tories argue scrapping them would lead to fewer homes being built.
Housing Secretary Michael Gove is expected to meet rebels in an attempt to head off the rebellion, the first of Rishi Sunak's premiership so far.
Downing Street said it remains committed to scale up housebuilding in England overall to 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s.
Currently, local councils have to incorporate government-calculated housing need targets into their long-term housebuilding plans.
Where councils fail to keep these plans up to date, planning guidance makes it harder for them to block new developments.
Longstanding divisions on the issue have now been reignited because the government's Levelling Up Bill, making its way through Parliament, contains a number of planning proposals. 
A group of 47 Tory MPs backed an amendment due to be debated on Monday that would ban government-calculated housing targets from influencing planning applications.
It would also scrap a current rule under which local councils have to maintain a rolling five-year stock of land for future development.
ry MP behind the amendment, Theresa Villiers, said the targets were ""undermining local decision-making"" and ""delivering excessive numbers in certain parts of the country"".
""I completely agree we need new homes - but we need the right homes in the right places,"" the Chipping Barnet MP said.
She added that the government's overall 300,000 target was not ""based on evidence"" and needed to be reviewed. 
Another rebel, Basingstoke MP Maria Miller, said ditching targets would put councillors ""back into control"" and ensure housing is built ""where local communities want them"".
But fellow Tory MP Simon Clarke, until recently the levelling up secretary under former prime minister Liz Truss, said scrapping all targets was ""desperately short-sighted"".
It would grant ""carte blanche for Nimby [Not In My Back Yard] councils to say no to any more housebuilding in their localities"", he argued.
He added it would deal a blow to those who want to get on the housing ladder, and be ""a disaster socially, economically, and politically for the Conservative Party"".
government's housebuilding target of 300,000 homes a year in England by the mid-2020s was unveiled by then chancellor Philip Hammond in November 2017 and appeared in his party's 2019 manifesto.
In 2019-20, there were 242,700 net additional dwellings, which fell to 216,490 in 2020-21, partly due to the pandemic.
Net additional dwellings is the government's headline figure for housebuilding, including houses being converted to flats or commercial buildings switching to domestic use, as well as new builds. It also factors in demolished houses.
government has repeatedly had to stress its commitment to the target, with former housing secretary Robert Jenrick having cast doubt earlier this year on whether it could be met and Michael Gove also appearing to back away from it.

first time that the government's formula for calculating housing need, which is based on population predictions, has provoked anger from Tory backbenchers. 
Boris Johnson's government abandoned a plan to tweak the formula in late 2020, after MPs representing southern seats complained it would place a disproportionate burden on their areas. 
ry rebels argue more needs to be done to prevent developers ""land banking"" by not building quickly enough on land where planning permission has been granted.
mendments to create stricter time-limits for such developers to start building, as well as tax penalties. 
Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy called the decision to delay Monday's votes a ""shambles"" and accused the government of ""running scared"" of its backbenchers. 
She accused the Tory rebels of wanting to scrap housing targets ""without a viable alternative"" - calling the move ""completely irresponsible"".
But she added there was ""a case for reviewing how housing targets are calculated and how they can be challenged when disputed""."	/news/uk-politics-63733149
health	Nurses' strike: West Yorkshire staff walk out for second day of action	"Striking nurses in West Yorkshire say they have received strong public support as they take part in a second day of industrial action. 
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) members joined picket lines in Leeds and Bradford as part of a walkout across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
RCN says nurses deserve a pay rise of 19%, but the prime minister says such an increase would be unaffordable.
One nurse on a picket line in Bradford said: ""It's 99% support for us.""
Nurses at the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust and Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust are among those taking part in the strike. 
Emergency care will continue but routine services will be hit again. 
Among the striking staff stood outside Leeds General Infirmary, Julie Parkinson, a trauma and related services nurse, said: ""I've been a nurse for 37 years and I never thought I'd see the day.
""It's an incredibly sad day for the NHS and nurses, we should not be here, we need them to come to the table.
""It's not about us, it's about patients and it's about the state of our NHS. It's a war zone out there and we need support.""
Richard Deacon, from the RCN, said: ""I think nurses have been under so much pressure in recent years, particularly with the pandemic. 
""I think what we're showing here today is the strength of anger about how nurses feel they're being treated along with other healthcare workers too."" 
He added: ""Nurses' pay in real terms is 19% behind what they should be being paid had it kept up with inflation, that's why it's our demand now."" 
Outside Bradford Royal Infirmary, Jessica Smith, a 37-year-old staff nurse, said: ""We were nervous there might be some negative reactions from us being out here, but it's been nothing but positive. 
""We don't want to be out on strike, we've proved during the pandemic that we would leave our own families to take care of these patients - now it's time for them to recognise and respect us."" 
government has offered NHS staff in England and Wales a 4.75% pay increase.
Union sources have told the BBC that if there is no move to reopen pay talks, then new strike dates will be announced before Christmas with a series of walkouts likely in January.
Helen Peacock, a discharge co-ordinator at Bradford Royal Infirmary, said: ""It's a shame we've had to take this action again, obviously it affects the general public and that's not what we want at all.
""If the government will get round the table, [RCN general secretary] Pat Cullen has said she's willing to negotiate - she just wants to talk.""
50-year-old continued: ""It's 99% support for us, they understand why we're doing it and understand we wouldn't do it if we didn't feel we had to.""  
""It's disheartening that it has had to come to this but it needs to be done, if we don't make a stand now when do we make a stand?"" said Nasima Begum, a 40-year-old staff nurse at Bradford Royal Infirmary.
""I understand patients are waiting and Covid has delayed appointment times, but if we don't get better staffing now you're going to be waiting even longer."" 
re are more than 100 nurses standing outside Leeds General Infirmary on another brilliant blue-sky day.
me in just five days these nurses have walked away from the patients they care for and about.
Every time a car beeps a horn they cheer and wave placards, including some homemade ones saying things like ""some cuts don't heal"" and ""safe staffing saves lives"".
Many of the nurses are deeply torn about going on strike but say this is about protecting the workforce and patients.
government says the pay offer is fair but those here don't see it that way. 
weather for this second strike is warmer than the first but this dispute shows no sign on thawing.
rike means routine care such as knee and hip replacements are likely to be affected. 
However, life-saving treatment must be provided and anyone who is ill or seriously injured should still call 999, or 111 for non-urgent care.
Hospitals in Bradford and Leeds which are affected by the strike have said urgent and emergency care will be prioritised. 
Anyone with hospital appointments should attend as normal, unless they have been contacted in advance by the hospital.

politics	Labour tells MP Nadia Whittome to delete Rishi Sunak tweet	"Labour has ordered MP Nadia Whittome to delete a tweet saying Rishi Sunak becoming prime minister ""isn't a win for Asian representation"".
Nottingham East MP posted after Mr Sunak was this week confirmed by Conservative MPs as the UK's first British Asian prime minister.
Her tweet triggered heavy criticism and was later deleted.
A spokesman for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has now confirmed she was instructed to remove it.
She had tweeted to say Mr Sunak was a multimillionaire who had, as chancellor, cut taxes on banks while living standards dropped in the UK and added: ""Black, white or Asian: if you work for a living, he is not on your side.""
Sir Keir's spokesman stressed that Rishi Sunak becoming the first British Asian prime minister was a ""great thing"" and something the country ""should be proud of"".
A spokesperson for Ms Whittome told the BBC she would not apologise for the tweet and had not been asked to do so by the party.
Labour has confirmed it is not expecting her to apologise and it is understood the party now considers the matter closed. 
In a statement Ms Whittome's office said: ""Like Rishi Sunak, Ms Whittome is second-generation British Indian. 
""Ms Whittome was pointing to Rishi Sunak's record as chancellor to demonstrate that effective political representation of British Asian communities - and the interests of all working people - is about far more than the ethnicity of the prime minister.
""Following a discussion with the Labour whips, it was agreed that Ms Whittome would delete the tweet.""

technology	FTX founder released to parents on $250m bail	"Former FTX boss Sam Bankman-Fried will face home detention while awaiting trial in the US on charges that he defrauded customers and investors of the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange.
A US judge said the 30-year-old former billionaire could be released to his parents on a $250m (£207m) bond.
At the hearing, Mr Bankman-Fried did not admit or deny guilt.
He has previously distanced himself from the charges, which have shaken the entire crypto industry.
""I didn't knowingly commit fraud. I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was,"" he told the BBC, shortly before his 12 December arrest in the Bahamas, where he lived, and FTX was based. 
wo of Mr Bankman-Fried's closest colleagues pleaded guilty to fraud on Wednesday and are helping with the investigation.
Federal prosecutors in New York have accused Mr Bankman-Fried of unlawfully using customer deposits made at FTX to fund his other crypto firm, Alameda Research, buy property and make millions of dollars in political donations. 
In a press conference last week, they described it as ""one of the biggest financial frauds in US history"" announcing eight criminal charges, including wire fraud, money laundering and campaign finance violations. Financial regulators have also brought civil charges.
Mr Bankman-Fried spent nine days in prison in the Bahamas weighing his choices before telling the Nassau magistrates' court on Wednesday that he would not fight extradition, which could have sparked a long legal fight. 
At Thursday's court hearing in New York, assistant US Attorney Nick Roos said prosecutors would not oppose releasing Mr Bankman-Fried on bail, despite a ""fraud of epic proportions"", pointing to his decision to return to the US voluntarily and his much diminished financial state. 
Mr Bankman-Fried's release requires him to surrender his passport and submit to location monitoring and detention at his parents' home in California. He also agreed to regular mental health treatment. His parents will co-sign the $250m bond, Mr Bankman-Fried's attorney, Mark Cohen said.
f two Stanford University professors, Mr Bankman-Fried founded FTX in 2019. 
Known to his legions of fans as SBF, the curly-haired MIT graduate was a hero in the crypto world, nicknamed the 'King of Crypto' and known for bailing out struggling firms and making massive donations to charity. 
f his firm, which was once valued at more than $30bn (£25bn), has unsettled the wider industry, sparking bankruptcy filings at other firms and further declines in crypto values.
firm declared bankruptcy in November, after customers and investors rushed to pull their funds from the firm amid reports that its finances were shaky.
Mr Bankman-Fried, who stepped down as chief executive the same day, has previously denied deliberate wrongdoing, and said he is focused on restoring funds to customers. 
At Thursday's arraignment, Mr Bankman-Fried spoke only once, when asked if he understood the conditions of his release, and that he could be charged with an additional crime if he fails to show up to court.
""Yes I do,"" he replied."	/news/business-64068810
sports	Gary Lineker: BBC should have spoken up about Russia at 2018 World Cup	"Watch: Gary Lineker on ""sportswashing"" and World Cup 2018 in Russia
Football presenter Gary Lineker has said he and the BBC should have spoken out more about human rights issues during the World Cup in Russia in 2018.
Lineker, who is fronting BBC coverage of this year's World Cup in Qatar, said: ""I think we were sportswashed four years ago when we were in Russia.""
He added: ""I do look back four years and feel slightly uncomfortable.""
re were calls for Russia to be stripped of the 2018 tournament after it annexed Crimea in 2014.
Lineker told BBC Radio 4's The Media Show that ""we didn't talk perhaps enough about the other issues"" as well as the football in Russia.
me around, the BBC panel of pundits did discuss human rights issues in Qatar ahead of Sunday's opening game.
Lineker said ""it was deemed the right thing to do"" to not just talk about the sport.
""I think we learned from what we probably felt was a mistake [with Russia]. I think looking back now in hindsight, we should probably have spoken out more.""
BBC Sport said it would not be commenting. 
Sportswashing is when a country or organisation seeks to improve its reputation by hosting or sponsoring a big sports event.
Lineker delivered a monologue at the start of the BBC's coverage in Qatar this weekend, describing the event as ""the most controversial World Cup in history"".
He told Media Show presenter Ros Atkins that the monologue and subsequent discussions with fellow presenters such as former England women's player Alex Scott ""was a decision by everyone in BBC Sport and these things are all thought through a lot, it wasn't just me"".
He added: ""Every country has different things and different developments, and there are different cultures and things are viewed in different ways. But the difference with this one was the corruption side of it. That was the difference for me, and that's why I felt it was important to stress it.""
Allegations of corruption, vote-swapping and links to trade deals at the highest levels of government have surrounded Qatar's winning bid to host the tournament.
However, the allegations have always been denied by organisers and remain unproven, and Qatar was cleared by Fifa several years ago. 
re is also controversy about human rights issues, including the fact that same-sex relationships and the promotion of same-sex relationships are criminalised in Qatar. Women's rights are also restricted.
And there have been grave concerns about the treatment of migrant workers, with deaths on stadium building sites, although the numbers are disputed.
Meanwhile, the BBC has also been criticised in some quarters for not showing the World Cup's opening ceremony on Sunday.
But Lineker explained that this was the norm for any World Cup.
""The BBC always shows the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, they never ever show the opening ceremony of football tournaments on BBC One. It's never been a thing, and so I think that's where people have got misled on this. They're not a big thing. It's like a 15-20 minute little thing that they do in the background.""
A BBC spokesperson also confirmed this was the case.
former England striker also said he would not have taken Qatari money to do football punditry there.
When asked about Gary Neville's decision to work for Qatari broadcaster beIN Sports, Lineker said:  ""That's his personal decision. It's very easy to be judgmental... we're all so judgmental these days. I wouldn't have done it, no, and I haven't done it.
""But, you know, it's his life and he has to live it how he wants to live it and make the decisions that he wants to do.""
Neville has previously defended his work in Qatar, telling BBC Radio 5 Live's Nihal Arthanayake: ""I'm going over to the World Cup, I'm going to work on the tournament, I'm going to continue to highlight things I believe are wrong.""
Ros Atkins' full interview with Gary Lineker can be heard on The Media Show on Radio 4 at 16:30 GMT on Wednesday, and on BBC Sounds."	/news/entertainment-arts-63720785
entertainment	Jimmy Kimmel returns to host Oscars 2023	"Jimmy Kimmel will host the Oscars for a third time when he fronts Hollywood's biggest event next spring.
r will be hoping for less controversy than last year when host Chris Rock was slapped by Will Smith.
Kimmel took the helm in 2017 - the year of  envelopegate - and 2018 before the Oscars went hostless for three years.
Oscars ratings have been falling in recent years although last year saw a slight improvement with the first full ceremony after the pandemic.
In a statement, Kimmel said: ""Being invited to host the Oscars for a third time is either a great honour or a trap. 
""Either way, I am grateful to the Academy for asking me so quickly after everyone good said no.""
Oscars executive producers and showrunners Glenn Weiss and Ricky Kirshner said they were ""super thrilled to have Jimmy score his hat-trick on this global stage"".
""We know he will be funny and ready for anything!"" they stated.
Next year's star-studded event will take place on 12 March. The Academy tweeted: ""Welcome back!"" to the talk show host as it shared the news of Kimmel's return.
During his last outing as Oscars host, Kimmel aimed barbs at Harvey Weinstein at the first Academy Awards since Hollywood's sexual harassment scandal unfolded.
Opening the event in 2018, Kimmel said: ""The Academy took action last year to expel Harvey Weinstein from their ranks.
""There were a lot of great nominees, but Harvey deserved it the most.""
Earlier this year, Kimmel found himself in hot water when he was accused of taking the spotlight from Quinta Brunson during the Emmys ceremony in September.
He was awarding the Abbott Elementary creator with the prize for outstanding writing for a comedy series but as part of a joke which began just ahead of the presentation, he stayed lying on the floor pretending to be drunk while Brunson made her speech.
He later apologised to Brunson on his Jimmy Kimmel Live! show for ""stealing your moment"", although Brunson had taken it in good spirits."	/news/entertainment-arts-63541440
business	Recession: Is it as bad as it sounds?	"Is the UK in recession? Probably. Does that matter?  Well, it may sound callous, but... not really.
No-one loses their job because the statistics tell us we're in a recession, or heading for one.
What matters is how an economic downturn affects people and not statistics. And you're probably wondering how it affects you, your employer or your business. While it will be very tough for a minority of people, where they lose jobs or businesses fold, the chances are that you'll be OK.
In a recession, weaker companies fail and people are put out of work. That can be because sales revenue drops, so that they can't meet their costs including the servicing of their debts. It can be because the market they're in is in decline, and they have failed to make a move into growing markets.
But most firms battle through and survive, some with reduced revenue, many with losses or reduced profits, and often with reduced employment. Some can even thrive. It's a good time to be an insolvency practitioner.
Survivor businesses can come out the other side in a leaner, more efficient shape, and in a position to pick up the market share vacated by those that haven't made it through.
Recessions and redundancies also have a happier habit of sparking companies into life. Some of the world's biggest tech giants were born in recessions.
So while there is a lot of attention paid to Gross Domestic Product, it matters as a gauge of where the economy has recently been, and how different sectors have been faring in comparison with each other.
Office for National Statistics says it is in touch with around 40,000 businesses every fortnight, using real-time surveys.  It is as thorough a survey of economic activity as we have.
But boiling down those surveys to one number - in this case a drop in output of 0.2% in the third quarter of this year, July, August and September - does not tell you how your business or employer is placed.
Putting two of these numbers together can give economists what they call a recession.
We won't know if this downturn can be given that name for another three months, but the signs are that the quarter we're now in - October to December - will see a contraction in output.  If so, that will be the second consecutive quarter of declining output from across the economy.
So in mid-February next year, we may find that we have been in a recession since last July. It is a backward-looking indicator of the economy's strength or weakness.
And the number reflects what you can already see around you, as people and businesses have changed their behaviour.  
Firms judge more forward-looking indicators to see how demand might change. If they can foresee tough times ahead in their sector, they pull back on investment, which they have been doing, and perhaps recruitment, of which more later. 
For those that look to the ""golden quarter"" leading up to the festive season to make the profit that can often keep them going through the rest of the year, decisions about stock levels had to be made by late summer.
People also adapt their behaviour.  We have heard recently from the property sector that there has been a cooling of house price inflation. Even though supply of homes into the market is well below demand, those bidding to buy are being more cautious.
most recent Royal Bank of Scotland recruitment survey reflects a fall last month in the number of permanent placements, and the first fall in temporary placements in more than two years. Recruiters may be pulling back, out of caution about what lies ahead, but more significant, the number of people looking to move jobs has fallen.  Workers tend to hunker down with what they know when things are getting tough, rather than taking risks. 
And if you have responded to rising energy bills by cutting back on expenditure elsewhere, as most of us have, this is not a result of being in a recession. Repeated in millions of homes across the country, that shift in spending, allied to lowered confidence in job security, is the cause of the recession. 
In other words, recession is not like a gathering storm that builds up somewhere else and breaks over the economy: instead, it reflects the economic decisions we can see all around us and which many of us are already making with our own finances.
So, while recessions are not catastrophes, but a normal part of the economic cycle resulting from lots of rational decisions that we ourselves are making, there are aspects of the one we're (probably) currently in that look different. Here are three.
Bank of England's assessment is that the recession began in the middle of this year, and will run through next year into the middle of 2024 - the longest recession since the were first published, nearly a century ago.
It says that it will be relatively shallow. The last two downturns we've seen have been exceptionally steep and sharp - in 2008, with a property crash leading to a financial and banking crisis, and in 2020 with the sudden jolt of a lockdown due to Covid.
financial crash left deeper scars than previous recessions, in that the banks are often the drivers of growth out of a recession, and in this case, they were badly damaged, squeezing their business clients hard, and being told to rein back on new risky lending.
What worked well, in that case, was that they were under pressure not to repossess homes where people could not afford mortgage payments. Previous recessions had seen that happen, it pushed down property prices, and worsened the short-term downturn.  However, very low interest rates since then have encouraged more lending for house purchase, pushing prices up relative to earnings and ability to pay.
Businesses have also enjoyed a long holiday from costly finance, and with interest rates rising again, some of those who took risks on debt will be left exposed.  
ONS's head of statistics told the BBC Today programme that he is surprised that 4% of firms say rising interest rates are their primary concern. They are more concerned for now about rising energy and supply costs.
September figures do not tell us much about the effects of the notorious Kwasi Kwarteng mini-budget, which provoked a market spike in borrowing costs. We are more likely to see that reverberate through the October figures, to be published a month from now.
A second difference in this recession is that the jobs market starts out exceptionally tight. In other recessions, jobs are shed as companies try to cut costs or as they go bust. Often, those job cuts come later in a recession or after it has, technically, ended.
Economic orthodoxy tells us that the threat of job losses has a moderating effect on demand for higher pay.
's not evident from the current spate of strikes and threatened strikes, probably because those union members do not see their own jobs as being threatened - most are in the public sector - or they judge that employers are able to pay more than they are offering.
Unemployment is forecast by the Bank of England to rise from very low levels, just above 3% of the workforce in Scotland and just above that for the whole UK, to more than 6% across the UK.
So those calculations on pay and industrial action may yet change. For now, however, recruiters continue to search out people for vacancies, pushing up pay to do so, and taking on apprentices.
r big difference with the financial and the Covid downturns is the response from the central bank and the government.
In a typical recession, central banks cut interest rates to help borrowers get through and stimulate investment coming out the other side. But this time, with inflation to be controlled, rates are on the way up.
Also in the past two downturns, the UK government used its spending power to boost demand, aiming to counteract the contraction. That has been the orthodox response since the devastating effects of doing the opposite in the 1930s.
In 2009, VAT was cut from 17.5% to 15% (the rate on most goods was later raised to its current 20% level), £3bn of government spending on capital projects, such as roads and buildings, was brought forward, businesses were given more time to pay tax bills, and there was a ""cash for bangers"" scheme encouraging people to replace polluting older cars with cleaner new ones.
In 2020, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, opened the spending taps with the furlough scheme and support for self-employed people, with a huge programme of grants and loans for business, and the big boost necessary to get the NHS through the crisis, including (some very questionable) spend on personal protective equipment. He followed up with the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, subsidising restaurant meals for a month.
In both cases, the government faced a steep drop in tax revenue, and opted to borrow on a big scale. This time, following the fiasco of the mini-budget in September, there is pressure to bring borrowing down as a share of national income. And without growth for a forecast two years, expansion of the economy is not going to help ease that ratio.
So this time, we see a UK government stuck between the orthodox response to a recession, which is to borrow and spend to counteract it, and the market pressure and conventional Conservative approach, which is to cut borrowing and the scale of government.
We'll find out next Thursday how Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, intends to resolve that tension. If he cuts spending and raises tax too sharply in the next two years, he could worsen and lengthen the recession. Removing or sharply cutting the Energy Price Guarantee after next March would contribute to that. 
Also for political reasons, he's more likely to save the harsher stuff until after the next Westminster election, which must take place by the end of 2024."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-63596804
business	Cost of living: Bath trader's sleepless nights over £100k energy bill	"A business owner is enduring sleepless nights after being told her energy bills will rise to over £100,000.
Annette Dolan, who runs Bath Aqua Glass, currently pays £14,000 a year, but is facing the steep rise at the end of September when her contract ends.
She said it would mean the price of a vase made at her glassblowing studio in Bath rising from £45 to £350.
Some businesses are already facing price rises in excess of 200% as gas and electricity prices soar.
Ms Dolan said she was concerned for the future of her business.
furnace at the Walcot Street business runs day and night, enabling staff to create handmade items including jewellery, jugs and stained glass.
But the increase has left Ms Dolan wondering how she is going to meet the costs.
""There's no way that we can actually operate at that level,"" she said.
""My bookkeeper and I are both having massive sleepless nights. We're both thinking, 'What are we going to do'?
""It's a nightmare. The brokers have been trying to get me to sign and I'm saying this is untenable, I cannot sign.""
Ms Dolan has worked in the glassblowing business for 26 years and says she will do all she can to keep the firm running.
""Whether I'm going to save this business or not only the future will tell me, but I will do my damndest for all my staff and myself,"" she added.
Energies, Ms Dolan's energy provider, said it offered a range of products to suit customer needs and advised customers to contact them if they are having difficulty paying.  
""We appreciate that unprecedented rises in wholesale gas and electricity markets and wider inflationary pressures are creating an extremely challenging operating environment for UK businesses,"" the company said in a statement.
Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said: ""No national government can control the global factors pushing up the price of energy, but we will continue to support business in navigating the months ahead.  
""This includes doubling our support for high energy usage businesses, reducing employer national insurance by increasing the Employment Allowance, slashing fuel duty, introducing a 50% business rates relief and putting the brakes on bill increases by freezing the business rates multiplier - worth £4.6 billion over the next five years.""

business	Pound hits new 37-year low as retail sales slide	"und has fallen to a new 37-year low against the US dollar after figures showed UK retail sales fell sharply in August as the rise in the cost of living continued to hit households.
rger-than-expected drop in sales volumes of 1.6% prompted fresh concerns over the state of the economy.
Sales across all retail sectors fell in August as households cut back in the face of rising prices.
One analyst suggested the figures showed the UK is already in recession.
Sterling fell more than 1% against the dollar to $1.1351 at one point, its lowest since 1985, following the release of the retail sales figures. The pound recovered later to climb above $1.14. 
und has been falling against the US currency for most of the year, partly due to the strength of the dollar. A weak pound means Brits travelling overseas will find their spending money will not stretch as far.
mes at a time when UK inflation, which is the rate at which prices rise, is running at a near 40-year high, despite slipping to 9.9% from July's 10.1%.
Bank of England has predicted the UK will fall into recession towards the end of this year and it is expected to keep increasing interest rates in a bid to curb inflation.
Olivia Cross, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said August's retail sales figures backed up the consultancy's view that the UK economy is ""already in recession"".
A recession is defined by the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods. 
""Retail sales will probably continue to struggle as the cost of living crisis hits harder in the coming months,"" Ms Cross said.
""But nonetheless the Bank of England will still have to raise interest rates aggressively.""
Higher prices, along with upcoming energy bill rises in October, have led households to tighten their belts when it comes to spending.
government announced the Energy Price Guarantee last week to help people with energy bills. The support will see annual energy bill for a typical household capped at £2,500 for two years.
rgy bills were set to rise to £3,549 a year and even higher in 2023, before the government intervened.
Ms Cross, of Capital Economics, said that because of the intervention, any recession would be ""smaller and shorter"" than it had expected previously.
Martyn Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said the government support  ""should ease both the income squeeze and lift consumers' sentiment, suggesting the outlook for retailers isn't as gloomy as could have been the case"".
""However, real household incomes are still on course for a significant fall over the next 12 months or so,"" he added.
government is expected to set out the estimated cost of plans to cap energy prices in a ""mini-Budget"" next Friday, as well as tax cuts pledged by Prime Minister Liz Truss in a bid to boost the economy.
Sterling's fall to a fresh 37-year low against the dollar today is not isolated. The pound also hit its weakest level against the euro for nearly a year and a half.
So while the big picture movement is strength in the US dollar, there continues to be specific additional pressure on the pound sterling in international markets.
morning's trigger was far weaker than expected retail sales figures. But markets await next Friday and the extent of borrowing required for the government's energy plan and tax cuts.
urozone too is heading for recession, but there is little comfort in such company.
risk is that a weaker currency, makes imports of essentials, from energy to food, more expensive, prolonging the period of high inflation. And if the UK's nearest trading partners are also in recession, exporters will not see significant benefit from a weaker pound.
fall in retail sales continues the slide since the summer of 2021, when all Covid restrictions were removed, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The drop seen in August was the largest month-on-month fall since December 2021.
Sales of food, online, non-food and fuel all fell in the month, the ONS said.
Supermarkets' sales volumes also fell by 0.9% in August, but alcohol and tobacco sales rose by 6.3%.
""Feedback from retailers suggests that consumers are cutting back on spending because of increased prices and affordability concerns,"" the ONS said.
Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, said people were ""clearly thinking hard about what they spend their money on"".
""It's just not stretching as far as it used to, and essentials have to come first. But even essentials are costing more and with the spectre of unmanageable fuel bills looming large people did the only thing they could, cut back,"" she said.
According to the ONS, department stores saw a large drop in sales in August - 2.7% - while sales in clothing shops fell by 0.6%.
""Big ticket purchases are being put off and that's unlikely to change in the coming months,"" said AJ Bell's Ms Hewson.
On Thursday, John Lewis revealed that while its shopper numbers were higher than last year, customers were spending less and avoiding buying as many ""big ticket"" items.
rtment store and its supermarket chain Waitrose reported a loss of £99m for the first half of its trading year. Waitrose said it sales were down 5% on last year, with basket sizes shrinking by ""nearly a fifth"".
Food prices have been increasing around the world following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has been one of the main factors pushing up prices at supermarket tills.
Meanwhile, the proportion of retail sales online fell to 25.7% in August from 26.3% in July, but the figure remains significantly above pre-pandemic levels. "	/news/business-62923994
entertainment	Bristol project offers opportunity for black women creators	"ree black women are being offered the chance to take part in a scheme aimed at creating more equality in music.
rtist development project, run by Bristol's Saffron Records, will provide tools, opportunities and support.
According to the organisation, black women account for less than 1% of professional music producers.
Saffron founder Laura Lewis-Paul said it is ""important"" for the company to use its platform to ""uplift the conversations around race"".
""The project is born out of an aim to lay deeper foundations for better visibility, representation and financial benefit for black creators in our area,"" she added.
Recent research by USC Annenberg shows the world's music tech industry is made up of only 5% women. 
It found women account for 2.6% of professional music producers and fewer than 1% of these are women of colour. 
x-month programme will offer one-to-one mentoring and an invitation to a residential artists' retreat.
Artists will also be paid £800 to create a piece of music exploring the topic of human relationships with technology.
Applicants must have black heritage and be a musical creative of some kind.
must also be a woman or identify as non-binary, trans, intersex or gender non-conforming and live in the south-west of England.
""We need to work together to put in long-term strategies to create systematic change against racism,"" Ms Lewis-Paul said.
""It feels overwhelming at times at the amount of change that needs to happen within the industry, but I feel positive about the small steps that are being taken on the road to long-term change,"" she added.
Applications for the scheme are open until 14 November.

politics	Welsh secretary admits £100 off-grid help is not generous	"Welsh secretary has admitted that the help offered to homes who use off-grid energy is ""not generous"".
Oil and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) are not covered by the energy price cap.
UK government said off-grid households will get an extra £100 on top of a £400 payment going to everyone.
David TC Davies said he was ""sure"" the UK government would be looking at the issue.
He made the comments at his first appearance at the Welsh Affairs Select Committee since Rishi Sunak made him Welsh secretary.
Mr Davies said he had also made ""known"" in government his concerns about jobs at Newport Wafer Fab, which is the subject of a delayed review of its Chinese-ownership.
He said the new prime minister intends to have a ""good and positive"" relationship with the Welsh government.
Conservative MPs are among those who have raised concerns about the support made available to households who use oil or LPG.
Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake has said the £100 would ""leave many struggling to make ends meet"".
revious business secretary, Jacob Rees Mogg, had defended the payment, saying there was ""equivalence"" in the level of support offered because the price of heating oil had not risen as much as the price of gas.
Asked about the issue by Delyn MP Rob Roberts, Mr Davies told the committee: ""I think £100 was certainly not generous, given the circumstances.
""I accept the argument that, in general, those who are on network gas will have seen much steeper rises in percentage terms than those who are off grid but, nonetheless, everyone has seen huge rises in costs.
""I don't feel the £100 was overly generous. I'm sure that's another factor the government will be looking at.""
He suggested he would bring the matter up with UK government colleagues: ""I will make a representation about that, given the percentage size in Wales of people who are off grid.""
Committee chairman and Conservative MP Stephen Crabb asked Mr Davies why the review into Newport Wafer Fab's purchase by Chinese-owned Nexperia had been delayed.
urchase of Britain's largest chip plant was called in for a national security assessment on 25 May by Kwasi Kwarteng, when he was business secretary.
Mr Davies said there was a ""national security issue here"", saying the type of material the plant produces is ""vitally important from a strategic perspective"". 
""The advice I've had is not to comment further on it, but to say that it has been very carefully looked at at the moment by government.""
""I know there are 200 jobs at risk,"" he said, adding he shared concerns about their future prospects: ""I've made that known"".
wide-ranging evidence session touched on warnings from council chief Andrew Morgan that councils could have to make huge cuts without more government funding.
Councils get most of their funding from the Welsh government, which in turn receives most of it from the UK government. 
Questioned by Cynon Valley Labour MP Beth Winter, Mr Davies some councils ""have quite significant reserves and this maybe the moment to look at that"".
He said the Welsh government received an increase in funding of £2.5bn and has tax raising powers. ""If they think there is a simple way to better fund local authorities they have the ability to do that themselves.""
Mr Davies said he would be speaking to the First Minister Mark Drakeford on Wednesday.
His appointment follows a difficult period of relations between the Welsh and UK governments. 
During the short tenure of Liz Truss there was no official contact between the prime minister and the Welsh Labour leader.
Mr Davies said Mr Sunak had told him ""it was important that we develop a good and positive relationship with the Welsh government""."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63487039
sports	Olympics Rewind: London 2012 - 10 things you may have forgotten	"Can you believe eight years have passed since the magical days of the London 2012 Olympics?
Moments from those Games will live with those who watched them for a lifetime - Danny Boyle's astounding opening ceremony, Super Saturday's golden rush and Andy Murray finally winning at SW19.
But what about the parts you may have forgotten? Those little moments away from the sporting action or the times when it all went a little bit skew-whiff?
's Public Display of Affection, in case you didn't know.
We certainly didn't know Jason Kenny and Laura Trott (as she was) were an item at that point, but when the world's cameras zoomed in on a certain David Beckham at a beach volleyball match, it was a kiss behind him that caught everyone's attention.
g ""for a little while"" but didn't want their budding relationship making the headlines before they competed. It had worked well - they won two gold medals apiece.
Eight years - and a further five Olympic golds - later, the Kennys are happily married and have a two-year-old son, Albie. And of course, they're targeting more success in Tokyo next year.
""Not using one's best efforts to win"".
was the view of badminton officials after two women's doubles pairs from South Korea and one each from China and Indonesia made a series of basic errors during matches.
All four pairs were accused of wanting to lose, in an attempt to manipulate the draw for the knockout stage, and were then disqualified from the competition.
China said they were aiming to preserve energy ahead of the knockout stages. The Koreans, on the other hand, tried to deflect the blame.
""The Chinese started this. They did it first,"" said South Korea's coach Sung Han-kook. Sounds like something you'd hear in the school playground...
We can all remember Mo Farah winning gold on Super Saturday, but you might have forgotten what was going on in the BBC studio at that moment. 
What a day 4 August had been. We had already seen two rowing golds and cycling gold on the track for the women's team pursuit before the fans had even taken their seats in the Olympic Stadium for the evening's festivities.
But three more golds were to come - all in the space of 46 magical minutes. First it was Jessica Ennis-Hill in the heptathlon, then Greg Rutherford in the long jump. And then Farah in the 10,000m.
um erupted as Farah crossed the line, slapping his head with disbelief. So too did the BBC studio, Colin Jackson and Michael Johnson bouncing around in their seats while Denise Lewis, having jumped out of hers some time earlier, screamed as she punched the air in ecstasy.
As newly-crowned 200m butterfly champion Chad le Clos paraded poolside, showing off his gold medal for photographers and waving to the crowd, he wasn't the only member of his family adorning himself to the public.
Up in the stands, the South African's father, Bert, was in the BBC studio, being interviewed by Clare Balding, overcome with pride at his son who had just beaten defending champion and world record holder Michael Phelps to gold.
""UNBELIEVABLE. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. I've never been so happy in my life,"" he said. ""Look at him, he's BEAUTIFUL. What a beautiful boy.""
was before he then saw a glimpse of himself on TV, prompting him to feel he needed to suck in his stomach - ""sorry, sorry"" he apologised to viewers.
Don't worry Bert, we've all been there.
Another parent, another classic moment. But when your son is about to become Britain's most successful Olympian, Carol Hoy had every right to be a little nervous.
Sir Chris Hoy's mum could hardly keep her eyes on the track as he competed in the keirin, the race in which he would win his sixth and final Olympic gold medal.
Unable to sit down, every emotion flashed across her face. One moment she was clapping and pushing him on, the next she's turning away and covering her eyes with her hand.
It's her reaction when Hoy crosses the line that's best, though. ""Oh thank GOD,"" she cries.
Exactly what we were all thinking, Carol.
g ceremony was still some 48 hours away but the Olympics did not get off to the best start with a mix-up on the very first day of sporting action.
As North Korean players were being introduced before their women's football match against Colombia at Hampden Park, South Korean flags were mistakenly displayed in the video package.
quad walked off and could only be persuaded to return when the teams were announced again with each player's face displayed next to the North Korean flag, delaying kick-off by about an hour.
Germany's Robert Harting won discus gold at London 2012, but it was his celebrations after his winning throw of 68.27m that caught the eye.
Roaring before ripping his shirt off in an Incredible Hulk-esque manner, he then donned a German flag as a cape and completed a victory lap of the hurdles track.
He cleared the hurdles, yes, but probably a good job he stuck with just the discus until his retirement in 2018.
Kate Richardson-Walsh's Olympics looked as though it was over before it had barely begun when she broke her jaw in Team GB's opening match against Japan.
Britain's captain was struck by a stick on the left side of her jaw in the closing minutes of play. Footage of the incident, and the sound of her screams of pain, made for uncomfortable viewing.
She later had surgery to fix a metal plate, but remarkably missed just two games before returning - wearing a protective mask - to lead the team to the bronze medal.
Four years later in Rio, it would be a different colour...
It wouldn't be a surprise if Stephan Feck has never watched his London 2012 campaign back.
German diver, in the second preliminary round of the men's 3m springboard, landed flat on his back after his foot appeared to slip off the side of the diving board.
He was awarded a failed dive with zeros across the board, with Leon Taylor calling it a ""calamity"".
""He probably lost a toenail or two,"" said the BBC commentator and Olympic silver medallist. Ouch.
We couldn't not include this one.
Who could forget our now-Prime Minister Boris Johnson getting stuck on a zip wire for several minutes?
Mayor of London, Johnson was trying out a 45m (150ft) high zip wire at Victoria Park when it lost momentum, leaving him dangling ""like an odd Christmas decoration"", as one onlooker put it.
A spokesman for Johnson at the time said: ""Clearly the judges are likely to have marked the mayor down for artistic impression, and unlike Team GB, the mayor may not be winning too many gold medals today."""	/sport/olympics/53252880

Oxford City will accept Bitcoin from fans buying tickets, food and drink at their RAW Charging Stadium as an alternative to card and cash.

ub's director of football said paying with Bitcoin could ""become the new normal"" at grounds.
It has agreed a multi-year partnership with Isle of Man-based CoinCorner, which will also be its back-of-shirt sponsors. 
mpany has produced The Bolt Card, which it said is the world's first contactless card for Bitcoin. 
Justin Merritt, the club's director of football, said: ""Embracing the latest technologies and innovations to ensure Oxford City FC can continue to operate as a self-sustaining club is a key part of our long-term objectives. 
""It's not mandatory for people to engage with our new technology, but we believe in time paying via Bitcoin will become the new normal in English football.""
Daniel Scott, CoinCorner's CEO, said: ""Innovation and forward-thinking sit at the heart of our key working objectives, just like Oxford City FC. 
""It's pleasing to see the club become the first adopters of Bitcoin payment in the National League. We believe this move will set a trend across non-league and Football League divisions as digital currency establishes itself as the new normal for sports fan and eventgoers across the UK.""

technology	Why is Elon Musk spending his time on Twitter, not on the mission to Mars?	"I have been watching Elon Musk for a number of years - and more closely than ever in recent months, since he decided, seemingly on a whim, to buy the social network Twitter.
He is one of the world's richest men - sometimes the richest, depending on the price of Tesla shares, his main financial asset. With a string of other high-profile companies under his wing, including Tesla, Space X, Starlink, and Neuralink, he is also a subject of global fascination. 
, of course, there is his own personal story - the tall, 51-year-old billionaire with 10 children ranging in age from one to 18. His first son died aged just 10 weeks. Musk, who was born in South Africa, has described living with Asperger's syndrome, a type of autism, and stated that his main goal in life is to colonise Mars. 
What I have learned is - as, perhaps, with many of us - there are many different faces of Elon Musk.
rsona he projects via his prolific tweets is provocative, controversial and bombastic. He loves a rude meme, knows whatever he says will make headlines around the world, and enjoys trolling the media with ever more outlandish statements and jokes. He likes trying to goad us journalists into writing ever more extreme headlines.
In public, he has learned to be a showman, whether dancing alongside electric-car-making robots, emerging triumphantly from the latest slick Tesla prototype, or being filmed walking into Twitter's headquarters carrying a sink - ""Let that sink in"" was the gag, playing off a popular meme on the site. This Halloween, he attended a party in leather armour, a $7,500 costume called ""the devil's champion"".
And yet Tallulah Riley, his ex-wife, whom he married twice, described him in BBC documentary series The Elon Musk Show as ""sweet"" and ""shy"". 
Veteran Silicon Valley journalist and author Mike Malone, who has known Mr Musk for 20 years, tells me he sees  ""a very reserved, very smart, very introspective and intellectual guy"" who spends long transatlantic flights with him reading complex trajectory tables, trying to work out how to land a spacecraft on Mars. 
r have a long-standing $5 (£4) bet over Mr Musk's ambition to send people to Mars by 2030. ""I said, 'I don't think you can do it - but I hope you do. I hope I owe you the $5,'"" Mr Malone says. ""That bet's still floating in the air"".
Sending people to Mars is a lifelong goal for Mr Musk. Some say it is his take on long-termism - a philosophy favoured by some very rich people which seeks to act in the interests of billions of people in the far future, rather than focusing on the immediate needs of the present.
At some point, the human race is going to have to leave Earth, he says. And his interest in space is clearly signposted in his existing business portfolio. But where, on Earth, does Twitter fit in? 
Mr Musk answered that question, this week - in a tweet.
""Social media in general, especially Twitter, were eroding civilisation,"" he wrote. ""If civilisation collapses before Mars becomes self-sustaining, then nothing else matters. Human consciousness is gone.""
But how was Twitter ""eroding civilisation""? 
Mr Musk said, at the very beginning, his aim in buying the platform was to create a 21st Century digital, global town square for discussing society's big issues. 
He has written many times about perceived imbalance under the previous regime, arguing that right-leaning views were given less visibility by Twitter staff than left-leaning ones, skewing debate and creating echo chambers where nobody saw material that challenged their existing viewpoint. With some handpicked journalists, he published the ""Twitter files"", a selected set of internal documents, to support his view.
mount of abuse and misinformation thrown around on the platform could also be seen as distracting from the real issues Mr Musk wants discussed.
But as anyone who has ever tried will know, navigating that tightrope between allowing free speech and suppressing hateful content is very, very hard.
Maybe there is a connection somewhere in Mr Musk's mind between Twitter and Neuralink, which is trying to create a direct link between human brains and computers. 
Could it be that Twitter forms part of his research and he has essentially bought himself a living, breathing neural network of 300 million people sharing their lives, and opinions, in real time, online? 
OK, we are in the realms of science fiction. But transporting that to another planet in some form would be one way of taking human consciousness away from Earth - and we know Mr Musk likes a challenge.
Mr Malone may never see his $5 - and betting against Mr Musk is generally a bad idea, entrepreneur Dolly Singh, who worked with him for six years at SpaceX, until 2013, says.
""I would, by rule, never bet against him,"" she says.
""Anything that's a machine - hands down, he's going to win.""  
But Ms Singh also thinks Twitter presents her former boss with a different challenge. 
""This is going to be harder than he has anticipated - and it's going to be a lot of work for him,"" she says.
Mr Musk has talked openly about preferring engineering and code to people. Growing up, he did not understand people did not necessarily say what they meant, he told a Technology, Entertainment, Design (Ted) conference in Vancouver, last year.
In a text message, released as part of court papers for a legal case against Twitter that never actually happened, he wrote: ""I interface way better with engineers who are able to do hardcore programming than with program managers/MBA [Master of Business Administration] types of people and/or frankly I hate doing mgmt [management] stuff. I kinda don't think anyone should be the boss of anyone. But I love helping solve technical/product design problems.""
His problem is that Twitter is one huge messy network of millions of people shouting, laughing, teasing, trolling, arguing - loud, complex and nuanced. 
Mr Musk has already struggled with trying to moderate it, even with a promise of a lighter touch than the previous regime. 
And Ms Singh is not the only observer to ask whether he will find it more difficult to run smoothly than he imagined. 
As a businessman and a leader, he can be brutal - although arguably no more so than other chief executives. 
Within one week of buying Twitter, he had laid off half the workforce. Those remaining were asked to sign contracts committing to an ""intense"" work ethic and long hours. 
Pre-Twitter, he was one of the first to call for the staff of all his companies to be back at the workplace full time following pandemic lockdowns. 
And he will not tolerate less than 100% commitment from his employees.
Ms Singh describes the Musk she knew as an ""incredible leader"", determined to ""prove everybody wrong"" when told he cannot achieve something, and, as is often said about him, a phenomenally hard worker.
""Elon wants to live in a world where he works 80 hours a week,"" she says.
""It's OK for him to say, 'I expect you to work as hard as me,' because he's not phoning it in from the beach, he's sleeping in a sleeping bag on the factory floor.""
Most people, she says, burn out after a while. He does not.
He has installed beds in Twitter's San Francisco headquarters, seemingly for his staff - although, he is understood to be sleeping there himself. He even shared a picture of his two-year-old son, X, wearing a company pass. 
Others who worked with him in the 1990s also recall his extraordinary work ethic. He was furious, one said, to find nobody in the office at 21:00 on a Friday night.
Ms Singh says his time is Mr Musk's most precious commodity. 
""Think about what it's worth, per second,"" she says. 
You do not need to do the maths to know it is eye-watering. 
And right now, he is pouring it all into Twitter. 
Perhaps Mr Malone should not spend his $5 just yet.

business	Humber ports traffic surpasses pre-pandemic levels - ABP	"rade through the Humber ports has surpassed pre-pandemic levels, in part due to hauliers seeking to avoid delays like those seen in Dover, bosses say.
Dafydd Williams, of Associated British Ports (ABP), said they were seeing ""really strong volumes of goods"" being moved through its terminals.
Speaking to BBC Radio Humberside, Mr Williams said the growth was ""possibly"" due to issues at other ports.
But he said recent investment had also made the ports more attractive.
Port of Dover saw long delays in the summer, due to post-Brexit border checks and amid claims of inadequate staffing from French border police.
""We are seeing some really strong volumes of goods coming through the Humber ports,"" Mr Williams said.
""We think it is possibly in part down to some challenges that other ports, like Dover, have faced where they saw delays. That may have fuelled some people's decision to use the Humber ports.
""But we think it is also because here in the Humber we offer a really good service.""
Mr Williams said ABP had invested £50m at its ports in Immingham and Hull, buying new cranes, increasing capacity and improving access to move lorries through the terminal quicker.
He added that the rise in traffic had so far not caused any disruption to the surrounding road network.
Asked if that might change with the planned imposition of additional checks of EU goods, he said two new border control posts had been built - one at Hull and one at Immingham - which should help avoid ""any significant delays or disruption"".
four ports in the Humber region - Hull, Goole, Grimsby and Immingham - take around 17% of the UK's trade, mostly destined for the North and Midlands, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
About 10% of the nation's energy supplies also come through the ports, as well as a quarter of all refined oil imported into the UK.

business	Snapchat owner hit as advertising slump hits sales	"Shares in the owner of social media platform Snapchat have plummeted after it missed revenue expectations and warned it faces ""incredibly challenging"" conditions.
firm says advertisers cut spending as they face supply chain disruptions.
Snap shares slumped by more than 25% in after-hours trade in New York.
Shares in technology giants including, Facebook owner Meta and Google's parent company Alphabet, also fell on concerns about economic headwinds.
After US markets closed on Thursday, Snap reported revenue of $1.11bn (£926m) for the three months to the end of June, which missed Wall Street expectations.
mpany said some of its advertisers had cut spending as they faced rising costs, supply chain disruptions and labour shortages.
firm also said privacy changes to iPhones, economic challenges, and increasingly tough competition for advertisers had ""substantially slowed"" its revenue growth.
However, daily active users on Snapchat grew to 347m by the end of June, beating forecasts.
It said it now aims to reduce hiring, grow its advertising business and find new sources of revenue.
After the results, shares in major technology firms that also sell online adverts - including Meta, Alphabet, Twitter and Pinterest - lost ground in after-hours trading.
Snap's earnings come ahead of results from larger rivals including Twitter, which is due to release figures later on Friday, while Alphabet is scheduled to post its latest update on Tuesday, followed by Meta on Wednesday.
Snap usually posts its earnings before other social media companies, like Meta, Google and Twitter. 
refore give a window into the health of the entire sector.
And if Snap's quarterly earnings are anything to go by, there's a problem. 
Social media companies have a very simple business model. The product is free - they make money by selling ads.
Advertisers aren't flocking to Snapchat though. In fact they seem decidedly nervous.
ften a sign that the economy is flagging - that people aren't spending as much as they used to.
But there are other factors at play too.
Last year, Apple introduced policies that let users opt out of personalised ads. 
rrible for companies like Snap - that have for years charged advertisers eye-watering sums for the privilege of targeting their users.
And the phenomenal success of TikTok is hurting the older generation of social media companies - as they lose eyeballs to the Chinese-owned platform.

health	RSV and flu: Canada getting foreign supply of pain meds next week	"More than one million bottles of children's pain medication will hit shelves in Canada next week, federal health officials have announced. 
ws will bring relief to Canadian parents who for months have grappled with a shortage of children's ibuprofen and acetaminophen (Advil and Tylenol). 
wide scarcity has collided with an unusual spike of viruses, like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
ming supply will be given to hospitals, pharmacies and retailers. 
Chief Medical Adviser Dr Supriya Sharma told reporters on Friday that Canada's health agency was exploring ""all levers"" available to combat the shortfall. 
""While drug shortages continue to make headlines, we are working tirelessly behind the scenes to end the shortages,"" she said. 
Officials had said previously they were working to secure a foreign supply of the drugs, but had not said how much would be ordered and when the shipments would reach Canadians. 
Empty drug store shelves - barren of fever-fighting children's medication - have spurred worry and frustration among some parents. 
rn has been worsened by a recent jump in viral infections among children, primarily influenza, RSV, and Covid, coming before the worst of flu season. 
""Respiratory virus season is challenging anyway, and this year seems to be even worse than usual,"" said Kelly Grindrod, a licenced pharmacist and professor at the University of Waterloo.
Some of the surge is an after-effect of Covid, Dr Grindrod said. 
Covid restrictions helped to keep many viruses at bay. Now, a large number of children are having their first exposure to these respiratory viruses all at once. 
medication shortage has also put added stress on an already strained children's health system, where emergency rooms and intensive care units have been running over capacity in recent weeks.

technology	Iran unrest: What's going on with Iran and the internet?	"Activists in Iran are expressing concern about widespread internet outages and residents being unable to access social media.
Anger has circulated online after over a week of protests sparked by the death of a Kurdish woman in police custody.
Internet monitoring group NetBlocks said Instagram and WhatsApp - two of the major communication tools that Iran usually allows - had been restricted.
WhatsApp said it was working to keep Iranian users connected.
wo Meta-owned apps have millions of Iranian users and have become increasingly popular after authorities blocked other platforms in recent years, including Facebook and Twitter.
gram, YouTube and TikTok have also periodically been closed down.
rmittent blackouts follow the eruption of nationwide protests over Mahsa Amini's death. The 22-year-old had been detained for allegedly failing to adhere to hijab (headscarf) rules. 
NetBlocks reported that the internet was partially reconnected on Thursday night but that on Friday it was suffering a ""nation-scale loss of connectivity"" again. 
""People in Iran are being cut off from online apps and services,"" Instagram chief Adam Mosseri tweeted, adding that ""we hope their right to be online will be reinstated quickly"".
But others accused Meta of being complicit in disconnecting users.
Meta has a team of Persian-speaking reviewers who look at and remove content that violates their rules.
If a post that has broken Meta's community standards has been reported by users or flagged by technology, it will be taken down.
Some shared their evidence that content supporting the Iranian protests had been blocked by Meta. 
People also reported not being able to access their WhatsApp accounts even when trying to use a VPN and proxy.
Ordinarily, website access is heavily restricted by government filters and only those with VPNs can access uncensored content from overseas websites. But this ban seems different. 
So what is really going on?
rnet blackouts largely come from Iran's biggest mobile phone operator being offline. Iran Mobile Communications Company has more than 60 million customers.
Earlier in the week, the communications minister blamed security reasons for the disruption.
But Isik Mater from NetBlocks told the BBC: ""The internet is one of the biggest tools that the Iranian authorities have got in their hands when unrest breaks out on the streets.""
She says because there is no private broadcast network in Iran, the internet is the ""only place"" where protesters can share their voice.
Miss Amini's death has unleashed anger over issues including personal freedoms and economic challenges in Iran. 
Protesters - many of whom are women who have been waving and burning their veils - say they fear an escalating crackdown. 
""We are worried that the world will forget about Iran as soon as the regime shuts down the internet - which is already happening,"" one activist, who wanted to remain anonymous, said. 
Most of the protests and campaigns are organised by people over social media and if they cannot get connected then it becomes much more difficult to mobilise. 
Shayan Sardarizadeh from the BBC's disinformation unit said: ""Shutting down internet connections nationwide is the nuclear option for Iranian authorities, only triggered when they fear protests are on a scale that pose an existential threat to the regime.
""It is an effective tool that severely harms the ability of protesters to organise, communicate and inform the outside world, but it also carries a huge cost for the Iranian economy, businesses and public services.
""However, Iranian authorities have shown time and again that when faced with a choice between a severe hit to the economy and cracking down on political unrest at any cost, they will always choose the latter.""
Clamping down heavily on protesters and internet blackouts has worked to suppress people in Iran in the past. 
But fears are growing that the situation could escalate to something like 2019 protests that erupted over petrol price rises, the bloodiest in the Islamic republic's history. 
During those protests, the internet was cut off for days at a time. 
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has said protesting is allowed in the country but ""rioting"" will not be tolerated.
""Protests have always happened in Iran. The protesters are heard. However, protests must be distinguished from rioting,"" he said.

technology	Raksha Bandhan to Laal Singh Chaddha: 'Struggling' Bollywood's online hate problem	"wo of India's biggest Bollywood stars have been facing social media calls to boycott their upcoming movies - but do such campaigns actually have any effect?
Laal Singh Chaddha and Raksha Bandhan, starring Aamir Khan and Akshay Kumar, respectively, have been trending this week on social media amid demands by a section of users to boycott the films, the actors and even Bollywood itself. Both movies are set to release in theatres on 11 August.
media trends seem to reflect the changing relationship between Bollywood - India's Hindi-language film industry which employs millions of people - and its audience, but experts say it's difficult to measure how much damage such calls can wreak.
Bollywood is yet to recover from the massive losses it incurred when theatres were shut for months during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Even after they reopened, several big-budget movies have failed at the box-office, leading some pundits to predict that the industry is staring at a major crisis. Adding to this is the massive success of a handful of films from southern Indian states which have scored even with Hindi-speaking audiences.
So there's a lot of hope and money riding on Laal Singh Chaddha - an official adaptation of Tom Hanks-starrer Forrest Gump - and Raksha Bandhan, in which Kumar plays a devoted big brother to four sisters. 
But right-wingers online have raked up old remarks made by the stars or others associated with the movies to accuse them of being ""anti-India"" or against Hindus.
Khan has had to defend himself and publicly affirm that he loves India after some people pointed to a 2015 remark expressing alarm over religious intolerance. 
remarks were widely seen as pointing to rising attacks on minorities after 2014, when a government led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power. After the comments caused a controversy, Khan has often said that his words were taken out of context.
week, the actor said he was ""sad"" that people seemed to truly believe he did not like India. ""I want to assure everyone that it's not the case so please don't boycott my films,"" he told the media.
It's harder to pinpoint exactly what's driving the opposition to Raksha Bandhan - Kumar is one of India's most bankable stars who has made a slew of films that appeal to Hindu nationalists. But many social media posts have criticised the film's screenwriter for criticising lynching by cow vigilantes; others have pointed to Kumar's tweet on milk being wasted in temple rituals and a 2012 film which criticises religious charlatans.
""It's true there's been a marked increase in calls to 'blacklist' online,"" says film critic Uday Bhatia. ""These are almost never organic, and often push a right-wing agenda.""  
Campaigns like these, Mr Bhatia points out, ""usually revolve around some imagined hurt to public sentiments that the film or the actor is causing"".
ronic because, as he adds, Hindi films ""go out of their way to appease their audience"". 
One of the year's biggest hits was a small-budget movie called The Kashmir Files, which polarised viewers with its treatment of the exodus of Hindus from Kashmir in the 1990s.
""Nationalism, Hindu honour, historical Hindu icons, Hindu suffering in the past and contemporary military strength have all become popular subjects for filmmakers in Bollywood,"" critic Sowmya Rajendra wrote recently.
Over the past few years, India's entertainment industry has also seen a divide between supporters and critics of the BJP's Hindu right-wing ideology.
Most big Bollywood stars prefer to keep their political opinions to themselves, fearing a backlash. Filmmakers who handle controversial subjects often face massive trolling campaigns and sometimes even police cases. 
Added to this was a campaign - triggered by the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput in 2020 - that sought to brand all of Bollywood as a nepotism-driven industry that punished talented outsiders. While there was some measure of truth to this, supporters pointed out that these challenges permeated across sectors, not just the film industry.
ffect of social media trolling and the toll it takes on people in the film industry has been a recurring topic of discussion on the latest season of the popular talk show Koffee with Karan.
""We as an industry were vilified. We were put in the dungeon for two years,"" producer-director Karan Johar, who hosts the show, said in one of the episodes. 
But while people in the industry have become more and more careful about their public image, experts say boycott calls may not affect box office results too much.
""True public opinion about industry folk is rarely reflected. Akshay Kumar is probably the most popular Hindi film star today, yet calls to boycott his film Raksha Bandhan were recently trending,"" Mr Bhatia says.
rade analyst Taran Adarsh points to the success of films such as Dangal - starring and produced by Khan - and Padmaavat, which faced massive right-wing protests.
""Everyone has become very cautious. But to understand whether or not [social media trolling] affects a film, you have to wait till its release. The audience response will tell you,"" he says.
Negative campaigns, Mr Adarsh says, make these films a talking point and whip up emotion before the public has even seen the film.
""But at the end of the day, if the audience loves a film, there is no stopping it,"" he says. 
While every Bollywood success can't be attributed to ""good content"", Mr Bhatia feels that the viewer remains king for now - ""not the troll"".
But with online spaces only becoming more toxic, it's unlikely that Bollywood's troubled relationship with social media will heal anytime soon.

sports	Ben Bril: The Dutch Jewish boxing champion sent to Nazi camps by Olympic team-mate	"Sitting in his boxing gym just outside Amsterdam, former Dutch champion Barry Groenteman is reminiscing about the times he used to visit his grandmother. 
When she was living in a retirement home and he would go to see her, he'd often come across an older man ""who was always shadowboxing: in the hall, with the nurses"".
Groenteman continues: ""He'd show me his ring, with the Star of David on it. And my grandmother would whisper: 'That's Ben Bril.'""
For the young Groenteman, it was an introduction to a man who would have a huge impact on him and whose story he feels compelled to tell.
Like him, Bril grew up as Jewish boy in Amsterdam, and - also like him - boxing became his life.
But there the comparisons end. Groenteman was born in 1986. Bril was born in 1912. By the time he reached his 30s, his life had been transformed by invasion, violence and anti-Semitism. 
On Monday, the Dutch boxing world will come together to celebrate the return of the Ben Bril Memorial night, at Amsterdam's famous Carre Theatre. 
gathered will remember how a serial national champion was forced into hiding and then sent to the Nazi concentration camps by a former Olympic team-mate. They will look back on his remarkable survival and consider his legacy today - inside and outside of the ring.
Bril grew up in one of the poorest parts of Amsterdam as the second youngest of seven children. 
It was a tough upbringing, according to Steven Rosenfeld, who is a relative of Bril's through his wife Celia and has written a book about his life: Dansen om te overleven (A Dance with Survival). 
""They lived in tenements, he didn't sleep in a bed, he slept on straw, they didn't have a toilet, he had to carry buckets down to the street,"" Rosenfeld says.
For the young Bril, fighting was a part of daily life. There were scraps with friends of course, but also clashes with rival groups from different communities in the tightly packed city, according to Ben Braber, a historian who has written extensivelyexternal-link about Jewish life in Amsterdam during the inter-war years.
But while some of his friends carried on brawling, Bril turned his hand to sport.
""Boxing was very popular in the Jewish quarter before World War II,"" says Braber.
""For some boys, it was hard fist-fighting for gamblers, but other young Jews joined clubs. They were popular because the training and the matches were an escape from daily routine, also [from] daily poverty.
""And [the young men] built their self-esteem, because the art of self-defence requires courage, stamina, quick reactions but also technical skills.""
Bril was one of those young men, and his career sparked into life early when - at the age of only 15 - he was selected to fight for the Netherlands at the Amsterdam Olympics of 1928.
He turned 16 on the opening day of the Games (there are some suggestions he had to falsify his birthdate in order to qualify and was in fact only 15) and reached the quarter-finals in his weight class - flyweight. 
As he got older, Bril found work in a butcher's shop, and used his new job to help develop his sport.
""He told me that when he had to chop up meat he always used his left hand, even though he was naturally right-handed, to strengthen his left jab,"" Braber remembers.
Rosenfeld recalls Ben's ""brick-like"" hands, toughened, he was told, by dipping it into pickle brine.
rough the late 1920s and the 1930s Bril became a serial champion, winning eight Dutch titles and national fame.
But life in Amsterdam would change dramatically over those years - especially for Jews like him.
Economic crisis, the rise of Nazi Germany and an associated increase in anti-Semitism in the Netherlands made discrimination against Jews increasingly prevalent.
Bril experienced this directly when, despite his domestic success, he was left out of the Dutch team for the 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. 
At the time, says Rosenfeld, he didn't fully understand what had happened, but it later became clear that he was blacklisted by anti-Semites on the Dutch national boxing committee.
Despite that, three years later in 1935 Bril claimed what, for him, would always be his greatest success - and the source of that Star of David ring he wore even as an old man.
He travelled to Tel Aviv, in what was then Mandatory Palestine, to take part in the second edition of the Maccabiah Games for Jewish athletes from around the world.
He and a fellow Dutch Jew, his friend Appie de Vries, both won gold medals and returned to a hero's welcome among the Jewish community in Amsterdam. 
It was at about this time that Bril started wearing the Star of David on his shorts, to match the ring he had won.
It is something of a tradition among Jewish boxers to wear the Star in that way and Bril was certainly not the first.
great 1920s American lightweight Benny Leonard, known as 'The Ghetto Wizard', did it in his heyday.
And, much later, as his own career took shape, Barry Groenteman would honour the man who inspired him by himself displaying the Star of David in the ring.  
For Braber though, Bril's act of identifying himself in that way, in 1930s Netherlands, is ""very significant"".
""He clearly identified himself as being Jewish, but he also wanted to be identified [by others] as being Jewish - that was an important matter to him,"" he says.
Right up to 1939, Bril was still wearing the Star in the ring, and handing out signed publicity photos of himself wearing those trunks.
Rosenfeld, who also interviewed Bril extensively for his book, says Bril's first motivation in wearing the Star was an expression ""of his sports accomplishment"" in winning at the Maccabiah, rather than a political statement.
But he was clearly well aware of the wider situation around Europe and wasn't afraid to act on his own initiative.
In 1934, Bril went with a Dutch Jewish group to compete in Germany.
Nazis had been in power for a year. The state had already begun to discriminate officially against Jews. The atmosphere was hostile and daily life was being made increasingly difficult.
Bril was appalled by what he saw. 
""We saw brown uniforms everywhere, swastika flags, the word 'Jew' on Jewish people's businesses,"" Bril told a Dutch newspaper many years later.
""I said then, as long as this regime is in power, I will never go to Germany.""
Despite his hurt at being overlooked for LA four years earlier, when the call came in 1936 for the Dutch champion to travel to Berlin for the Olympic Games, he turned it down.
As his amateur career continued and his fame grew, Bril married his wife Celia. They had a son - Abraham - and opened a sandwich shop in the city of Utrecht.
But their lives, and those of everyone in the country, were turned upside down by the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939. In May 1940 Germany invaded the Netherlands.
Initially little changed, but gradually life for Dutch Jews became more restricted, and increasingly under threat.
""In 1941, stricter regulations came in which were clearly an attempt to segregate the Jews in the Netherlands from the rest of the population,"" historian Braber says.
re were restrictions on which public spaces Jewish people could enter, and in particular an attempt to force bars and cafes to ban Jews from their premises, which often ended in violence.
rked the creation of a number of Jewish defence groups, some centred around the sports clubs like the one of which Bril was a member.
On 11 February 1941, Dutch Nazis marched into the Jewish district of Amsterdam.
A previous incursion two days earlier had resulted in attacks on Jewish homes and businesses, and there was a fear, says Braber, that synagogues would be the next target.
So the defenders - armed with bricks, metal bars, anything they could get their hands on - prepared themselves for another confrontation.
me it was even more violent and bloody, ""a ferocious battle"", says Braber, that resulted in the death of at least one Nazi and led to repercussions against the Jewish community.
Within two weeks some 400 men had been rounded up and deported - many survived no more than a few months.
Although Braber was told by a friend of Bril's that Bril was involved - and many men he knew certainly were, including his trainer and a number of fellow boxers - it is unlikely that the champion took part directly in the fighting.
Rosenfeld says Bril was told to stay away, because his fame might make him a target.
But the brief confrontation in Amsterdam's Waterlooplein square, with Jewish fighting groups at the core - ""a form of Jewish resistance unique in Europe,"" says Braber - was a stark demonstration of how life in the city had changed.
midation, violence and official discrimination continued to grow in intensity in the months that followed and in July 1942 - shortly after it became compulsory to wear a yellow star - came the first deportations of Dutch Jews.
""At that point virtually nobody in the Netherlands knew exactly what was happening in those camps where Jews were sent,"" says Braber.
""What we know now about gas chambers and extermination camps only became clear after the war. Nonetheless, some 20% of people who were called up [for deportation] didn't turn up, and went into hiding.""
umber included Bril and his family. As Braber points out, the decision to hide was a perilous one: ""'Can we stay together, can we get help, are these people trustworthy?' All these types of things you have to think about.""
According to Rosenfeld, the Brils were sheltered in a variety of different places and - despite the danger - were often out and about.
But eventually they were betrayed and held in custody - in a bitter echo of Bril's sporting life - by Sam Olij, who had been Bril's team-mate on the Olympic boxing squad of 1928. 
Bril had also boxed with Olij's sons in Amsterdam, but the Olij family had become committed Nazis. According to Dutch sports historian Jurryt van de Voorenexternal-link it was Olij's son Jan who arrested Bril and his wife and son.
Bril family were sent to the camps. First to Vught in the Netherlands, then - up by the German border in the north - to Westerbork, and finally to Bergen-Belsen, where it's estimated 50,000 people died, Anne Frank among them.
De Vooren has described Olij as ""a notorious Jew hunter"" who committed ""the worst kind of betrayal in Dutch sport"". After the war, he served nine years' imprisonment and died in 1975, while his son Jan was said to have fled to Argentina.
re is one moment that stands out from Bril's life in the war beyond all others. It was a moment fraught with danger, but one in which he acted instinctively. It came at the Nazi concentration camp at Vught, and we can hear about it through Bril's own words, because he told the story to Braber in the 1980s.
""A boy had attempted to escape [but] they caught him,"" said Bril.
""They placed him on a rack, and he was to get 25 lashes of a whip. Suddenly the commander called out: 'Boxer - step forward!'
""I had to carry out the punishment, but I refused. The commander said that if I didn't I would get 50 lashes, so I took the whip but when I hit him, I aimed to strike too high.
""The commander got mad: 'Not so!' he cried. He grabbed the whip and started beating like mad. I walked back to my line.""
Why Bril suffered no consequences for his refusal to carry out the order is not known, but those who witnessed it were under no doubt as to what they had seen.
""[Ben Bril was] the only man I saw during two and a half years in concentration camps - or heard of - who risked refusing to carry out a formal order of the SS,"" Braber quotes the head of Vught's Jewish administration as testifying after the war.
It was, says the historian, ""a very courageous act"".
But Bril would also have to fight in the camps, both in Vught and in Westerbork. As a famous boxer he was a target - someone who the guards might want to see in action.
In 1988, on Dutch television, Bril told of one life-changing moment. ""I boxed for my son, who was dying,"" he said. 
He was to fight against a 'kapo' (a camp inmate who was appointed by the Nazis to guard and control the other prisoners) in Vught.
man asked Bril not to knock him out. He replied that he would comply on condition that the man help him get medicine, and agree not to beat the inmates in his block.
Steven Rosenfeld says the man complied, and Bril's son overcame his illness.
Bril also helped organise fights which were staged for the entertainment of the camp authorities. Those taking part might have got extra rations or other benefits, according to Braber.
Groenteman made a powerful television programme about Bril's story and recalls being shown, by a former inmate, the papers detailing some of the fights in Camp Westerbork.
""I saw such a lot of names I know, I know their grandchildren,"" he says.
""The scariest thing was that they were so similar to the schedule papers that hang in changing rooms now, when I'm going to an amateur event with my guys. That was hard.""
Almost all of Bril's extended family died in the Holocaust, but his son Abraham and his wife Celia survived the war along with him. 
In January 1945, from Bergen-Belsen, the family were included in a prisoner exchange that saw them taken first to Switzerland, then to a United Nations camp in Algeria, before making it back to Utrecht.
Bril didn't return to the ring as a fighter after the war, but he couldn't leave boxing. 
He became a senior official in the sport, acting as a referee and judge at fights around the world, all the way into the 1970s.
He went to the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 1964 (where he once again showed his character by leaping into the ring to protect a fellow referee who had been punched by a competitor), Mexico City in 1968 and Montreal in 1976.
He missed the 1972 Games in Munich, and its own tragic story, only because of a dispute with the boxing authorities in the Netherlands.
Ringside or on the canvas, he played a small role at the start of the careers of some of the greats, officiating in fights involving world champions Joe Frazier, George Foreman and Sugar Ray Leonard.
Bril died in 2003 at the age of 91. The first memorial night in his honour was held four years later. 
Groenteman made his first appearance at the Carre at the 2011 event. He fought with the Star of David on his trunks, both to honour his family and the man who had inspired him as a youngster.
""I think that day I boxed the best fight in my whole career,"" he says.
""People get their strength from their religion, from meditation, from mindfulness, from where they come from. I always felt when I was boxing with the Star on my trunks, it gives me more power.
""We're raised up with the attitude: 'Never walk away from where you come from.' Ben Bril stood for who he was."""	/sport/boxing/63227822

Bromford has some 40,000 homes in the region but its chief information officer said there was no evidence the hackers had been successful. 
Earlier this week, the housing association announced it had shut down its systems as a precaution
f executive said: ""Returning to normal can only happen when we know our systems are safe.""
rganisation provides services for about 90,000 people, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. 
Chief information officer Dan Gooddsall said: ""As a precaution we have shut down all of our technology, this includes the systems which tell us which appointments we have, the systems we use to communicate with customers and the systems we use to interact with our suppliers.
""This means that we are only taking emergency calls on the main Bromford number but you can still make payments using our automated phone line.
""And you can still contact your neighbourhood coach by phone or text.
""We know how much of a pain this must be and we are so sorry for missed appointments and how limited our service is,"" he added.
Bromford's chief executive, Robert Nettleton, gave an update on Thursday to assure customers there was no evidence of a data breach.
He thanked all customers, suppliers and partners for their patience and understanding and said: ""We are now working to return to normal in a safe and controlled manner"". 
""Please remember that all our neighbourhood coaches, our income colleagues, and support workers are here to help you and work with you,"" he added.

business	Mortgages: What happens if I miss a payment?	"rage interest rate charged by mortgage lenders is near its highest level for 14 years, adding to cost-of-living pressures.
So what can those struggling to make repayments do - and how must their mortgage provider help out?
re are different types of mortgages - all of which have become more costly in recent months.
Mortgage rates have been rising, so the 1.6 million people on tracker or variable deals have been paying much more than a year ago. 
mated 300,000 homeowners coming to the end of a fixed deal every three months are also facing a much higher monthly bill. 
, they could end up paying an extra £3,000 a year, the Bank of England said.
fficult to answer. Analysts expect Bank of England interest rates to peak at about 4.75% next year.
For anyone on tracker deals, at least, that means higher repayments to come.
Recent data indicates that rates on fixed-rate deals have fallen slightly in recent weeks.
House prices have also started to fall as higher interest rates put off buyers.
In November, prices fell 2.3%, the biggest monthly reduction for 14 years, according to the Halifax.
However, a decade or so of ultra-low mortgage rates - which many homeowners have become accustomed to - is clearly over.
re is a smaller choice, but still plenty of options depending on your circumstances.
An agreement between lenders, the Treasury and regulators means that people can switch to a new fixed-rate mortgage, without a new affordability test, when your current deal ends as long as you are up to date with payments.
A shortfall equivalent to two or more months' repayments means you are officially in arrears.
But your lender must make reasonable attempts to reach an agreement with you.
In fact, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - which regulates mortgage lenders - wrote to chief executives during the summer, reminding them they must treat customers fairly.
Crucially, customers must contact their lender as soon as they realise they are going to struggle to make repayments - the earlier the better. Trained and experienced staff must be on hand to help.
Within 15 working days of falling into arrears, your lender must:
Your lender must then treat you fairly by considering any requests about changing how you pay, perhaps with lower repayments for a short period.
Any arrangement you come to, the FCA points out, will be reflected on your credit file - affecting your ability to borrow money in the future - as will any missed payments.
Your lender might also suggest or allow you to extend the term of the mortgage or let you pay just the interest for a certain period of time.
A mortgage payment holiday enables customers to delay repayments - but not indefinitely.
Lenders may offer this option, depending on individual circumstances - and not to those already in arrears - but the level of support offered during the Covid pandemic has been reduced.
Again, this will show on your credit file. 
governments run some mortgage-support schemes - but the criteria can be complex. Here is a guide from the government-backed Moneyhelper website.
Some people may decide to sell their home and - in extreme circumstances - the lender could take court action to repossess it.
Repossessions are far rarer than they used to be.
re are lots of stages before a lender can take such action and the whole process takes about two years.
But if you think your home is at risk, it is well worth getting free, independent debt advice."	/news/business-63486782
technology	Ankur Warikoo, Rachana Ranade: The YouTubers Indians turn to for financial advice	"When the pandemic hit two years ago and movie studios in Mumbai downed their shutters indefinitely, 23-year-old filmmaker Shivam Khatri decided to teach himself a skill he'd not learnt at school or college - managing money.
He rummaged through books and tutorials, but quickly learnt that it was the young financial content creators on YouTube that spoke his language.
""Their videos are simple and easy to understand. And they cover a variety of topics,"" Mr Khatri says. 
One of the creators he followed avidly was Rachana Ranade, whose impish, breezy manner of breaking down complex financial jargon into easily digestible content has earned her 3.5 million subscribers on YouTube - proof of a growing appetite for easy-to-understand financial content among India's young, tech-savvy investors. 
In her swanky new office in the western city of Pune, Ms Ranade showed us a wall-to-wall graphic that mapped her rise as a YouTuber. She uploaded her first video in February 2019 and in barely five months she'd reached 100,000 subscribers. Her growth since then has been nothing short of meteoric.
Ms Ranade often gets mobbed for autographs and selfies - the kind of adulation normally reserved for Bollywood celebrities or cricketing icons. 
An unabashed movie buff, one wall of her office features quotes from Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan's movies. She uses these quotes to explain financial concepts that are hard to grasp. There's one from the hit film Kal Ho Na Ho - which translates to ""whether there is a tomorrow or not"" - to emphasise the need to buy life insurance.
It all boils down to one mantra - ""finance that's simplified"", Ms Ranade says. 
It's exactly what India's young investors are after. Millions of them opened trading accounts during the pandemic to participate in the market bull run, aided by investing services online. 
But only three out of 10 Indians are financially literate, official surveys point out. And they are hungry to learn how to make an easy buck in the stock market, or the ropes of entrepreneurship amid a unicorn boom that's made overnight billionaires.
It's this sweet spot that's turned financial content into one of the fastest growing genres online.
""For Gen-Z and millennials, YouTube is a university now in India,"" says Ankur Warikoo, an entrepreneur-turned-""fin-fluencer"" - or financial influencer - whose videos focus on personal finance, entrepreneurship and productivity hacks. 
His massive popularity even got him a publishing contract last year, with his first book, Do Epic Shit, quickly becoming a bestseller.
While the perception is that he became a sensation overnight, Mr Warikoo says his journey as a content creator started nearly a decade ago. But the pandemic proved to be an inflection point.
""Suddenly, there was a rise in high-quality content being offered by a lot of creators. There was an audience with time and money at hand, and a market that was extremely supportive,"" Mr Warikoo says. ""If this was a bear run, you would struggle to put your point across.""
It was ""a potent mix"" of enabling factors - cheap data, growing internet penetration and the shift among India's Gen-Z and millennial population from TV and print to digital video - that led to this success, Mr Warikoo explains.
He adds that the topic - money - especially resonated with young Indians: ""It's something that we all wish to understand but have very rarely been given an opportunity to [understand].""
For years, India has had several business channels broadcasting real-time financial market news. But they largely cater to traders and institutional investors, rather than first-time investors.
's a gap in the market that many of the YouTubers have successfully been able to fill. 
And because of their success, they are now being wooed with big money from advertisers and brand managers. According to Forbes magazine, top influencers can earn as much as $20,000 for a single branded video.
Experts laud the fact that financial education is now more accessible, but they also advise caution.
While business news channels are strictly regulated, most digital content creators operate in a grey zone. Ms Ranade and Mr Warikoo do not recommend individual stocks, but many others do, often without the necessary expertise or qualifications.
""When it comes to slightly finer issues of long-term investing, I would trust people who have been through a few market cycles. Right now while this digital phenomenon has overtaken us, everything has only gone up,"" says Govindraj Ethiraj, a former editor at a business channel, who now runs a fact-checking website.
After a two-year bull run, Indian equity markets are experiencing a lot of volatility with billions of dollars of foreign money being pulled out of the country. 
So the next few years, Mr Ethiraj says, will be the first test of whether the success of India's new money influencers is enduring or merely ephemeral. "	/news/world-asia-india-61877422

Sparksy, as he was known, presented the breakfast show at the station for many years and commentated on Plymouth Argyle games for 32 years.
61-year-old was being treated for cancer at a hospice in Plymouth.
m Davie said he was ""deeply saddened"" to hear the news, adding he was ""the gold standard in radio broadcasting"".
""His passion for where he lived came through in every show,"" Mr Davie said.
""Gordon will be remembered fondly as the voice of BBC Radio Devon and of Plymouth Argyle but, most of all, as a friend to all of his listeners.
""Our thoughts are with his family, many friends and colleagues.""
BBC Radio Devon presenter Gordon Sparks' best bits
Mark Grinnell, a BBC executive and the editor of Radio Devon who gave Sparks the breakfast show, said: ""Massive loss to Plymouth, massive loss to Devon, massive loss to the BBC. A great broadcaster.
""He'll be remembered by many listeners I know as the voice of Argyle, voice on the breakfast show on their radio station. He'll be remembered to us as a dear friend and colleague.""
Plymouth's Tom Daley was about age 10 when he spoke to Sparks in one of the Olympic diver's first ever radio interviews.
He said: ""I remember coming into the studios and he just made me feel so welcomed and so at ease and he was always so warm and friendly.
""He would ask you questions and you'd feel like you were just in a room chatting to a friend.""
Daley said: ""It's just such a sad day, it's also really special to see so many people sharing their stories and their memories of Gordon.
""I remember seeing him at so many different events he would come down to, whether it be at the diving pool or awards evenings, charity events and he was just an all round special guy. Devon has lost someone very special.""
South West Devon Conservative MP Sir Gary Streeter, who was interviewed by him many times, said: ""I always used to look forward to a bit of banter with Gordon... he's going to be sadly missed.
""The thing about him was he's so authentic, he didn't pull any punches with us.""
Luke Pollard, the Labour MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, added: ""You could see how passionate he was and that's not just about Argyle and how we were doing, it wasn't just about Plymouth, it wasn't just about Devon it was this joy about living life to the full.""

politics	Could Boris Johnson really make a comeback?	"Boris Johnson, the man ousted as UK prime minister by his own government just three months ago, has emerged as an early front-runner to be the next prime minister. 
His replacement Liz Truss crashed and burned after 45 days in the job, announcing her resignation after being forced to ditch most of her policy programme after it spooked the financial markets.
A second Johnson premiership would be an extraordinary turnaround even for a politician who has made miraculous comebacks before.
No one has returned as prime minister after resigning as leader since William Gladstone 140 years ago. 
Mr Johnson won a landslide election victory in 2019 - but was forced out by his own MPs after three years in office, following a string of scandals. Under the British constitution, the ruling party can change leaders between general elections.
His final months in office were dogged by accusations he broke ministerial rules by not telling the truth about Covid lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street. 
He remains under investigation by the Parliamentary Standards Committee, which in theory could lead to him being suspended from Parliament, or even being kicked out as an MP. 
mmittee could hold televised evidence sessions in the coming weeks - even calling Mr Johnson to respond in person. Mr Johnson's supporters have dismissed the committee's investigation as a ""witch hunt"".
rospect of Johnson's return to Downing Street has been met with horror by some Conservatives. Former leader Lord Hague warned it could lead to a ""death spiral"" for the Conservative Party.
Foreign Office Minister Jesse Norman said Mr Johnson returning as prime minister would be an ""absolutely catastrophic decision"" while Tory MP Sir Roger Gale has said he would quit the party.
But Mr Johnson's supporters, including cabinet members Jacob Rees-Mogg and Anne-Marie Trevelyan, and former home secretary Priti Patel, say he is the only contender with the backing of the voting public after winning the 2019 general election. They believe he can win the next election for the party too, despite the Labour Party's current commanding poll leads.
Mr Johnson has yet to officially announce he will stand. The first contender to break cover was cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt, who came third in the last leadership election and announced on Friday that she was standing. Former chancellor Rishi Sunak confirmed on Sunday that he would be throwing his hat into the ring.
In his final appearance at Prime Minister's Questions in July this year, Mr Johnson made it clear that he was planning a comeback.
He signed off with ""hasta la vista, baby"". He could only have dropped a heavier hint that he was not finished yet if he had used another catchphrase from the Terminator films: ""I'll be back.""
Johnson bids farewell at PMQs saying: ""Hasta La Vista baby""
Leadership hopefuls need the backing of at least 100 Tory MPs by Monday afternoon to stay in the race. 
mall task for a man who had 148 of his colleagues vote against him in a confidence vote in June - followed by nearly 60 ministerial resignations one month later.
uge of resignations followed revelations that Mr Johnson had ignored accusations of sexual misconduct against Chris Pincher before appointing him deputy chief whip.
On 5 July, two senior cabinet ministers resigned within minutes of each other - including then chancellor Rishi Sunak, who left claiming Mr Johnson was not competent or serious.
But before the resignations, pressure had been building on Mr Johnson for criticism over his handling of parties that took place in Downing Street during Covid lockdowns.
Mr Johnson was one of 83 people fined by police for a string of illegal parties - including a birthday party for Mr Johnson. 
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the former prime minister was ""unfit for office"". Scotland's Frist Minister Nicola Sturgeon called a Mr Johnson return a ""ludicrous suggestion"".
He was described as ""Britain's Berlusconi"" by the Liberal Democrats.
According to betting website Oddschecker, Rishi Sunak is the favourite to become the next prime minister. Mr Sunak has odds of 1/6 to take over from Liz Truss while Mr Johnson is 4/1 with Ms Morduant at 25/1.
If only a single candidate emerges the contest will be over on Monday - if not the new leader will be chosen by a vote from party membership on Friday 28 October.
Polls taken in the final days of Liz Truss' premiership have consistently shown Mr Johnson as the most popular successor among Tory members. 
Patrick English, associate director of polling company YouGov, said ""if Mr Johnson goes to the final two, he's got the edge""."	/news/uk-politics-63342114

wo-storey building includes two theatres, supporting services and a six-bed recovery ward.
United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust built the complex at Grantham Hospital.
Under a recent review of NHS services in Lincolnshire the hospital is to become the county's specialist orthopaedic surgery centre.
Reports earlier this year said initial ground works for the new modular buildings had started in November 2021 and it was hoped the new build would be ready for use this summer.

business	Jaguar Land Rover cuts output at UK factories due to chip shortage	"Carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is reducing output at its factories in Solihull and Halewood until the spring, due to ongoing problems obtaining enough computer chips for new vehicles.
xpected to affect the output of models such as the Jaguar F-Pace and Land Rover Discovery Sport.
move is understood to be temporary, as first reported in the Guardian.
In the meantime, JLR will focus on more profitable models such as the Range Rover.
Output of these cars has been ramped up in recent months. 
JLR's factory in Nitra, Slovakia, is not affected. 
Modern cars are heavily reliant on computer chips to control a variety of onboard systems, ranging from anti-lock braking and emissions controls to satellite navigation and in-car entertainment.
But supplies from East Asia have been heavily disrupted in the wake of the Covid pandemic, while carmakers have faced intense competition for available supplies from other industries.
In a statement, JLR said it would ""continue to actively manage the operational patterns of our manufacturing plants whilst the industry experiences ongoing global semi-conductor supply chain disruption"".
""We expect our performance to continue improving in the second half of the year, as new agreements with semiconductor partners take effect, enabling us to build and deliver more vehicles to our clients,"" it added.
UK car production still remains well below levels seen before the pandemic, despite an increase in October, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) show.    
ustry built 69,524 cars in October, up 7.4% from a year earlier, but the SMMT said manufacturers were still suffering from ""turbulent"" supplies of components.
""There's been real shortages in the supply chain, most obviously in semiconductors, which is leading to really erratic levels of production,"" the SMMT's chief executive Mike Hawes told the BBC's Today programme.
""[Production] was up in October, but we expect it to be volatile as we go forward especially when some parts come from China.""
Mr Hawes said the UK was ""no way close"" to making enough chips for the car industry.
""Massive investments are required and some governments in the world are putting up billions upon billions of pounds to attract investment and build new fabs (semiconductor fabrication plants).
""We should be building about a million cars a year, so when you have about 1,500 chips per car you can see just how incredible the volumes of these chips you need just to support the automotive industry, let alone things like personal electronics."" "	/news/business-63756079

Ms Brunner's review is set to examine all aspects of the Manx government's pandemic response, including legal restrictions, the vaccine roll out and Covid support schemes, as well as the deaths as a result of the virus.
More than 100 people have died from the virus on the Isle of Man.
Conclusions from the review and any subsequent recommendations are due to be laid before Tynwald by December 2023.

politics	What can we expect from Rishi Sunak as prime minister?	"BBC finds itself criticised now and again for broadcasting too many repeats. 
So perhaps I should apologise, for it's just seven weeks to the day since I popped up on the telly and radio to look ahead to a new prime minister assuming office. 
Leading a fractious party, at a time of economic gloom, a war in Europe and without a mandate to call their own from the electorate. 
And here we go again. 
Except this time Rishi Sunak inherits all this as well as the extra challenge of the fallout of the insurrection against his predecessor Liz Truss. 
Senior figures in government don't dispute that her vision, its near instant collapse and its consequences left the UK an international laughing stock. 
So enter the latest new prime minister.
fifth in a little over six years.
rd of this year.
rd in two months.
I know people like me keep wanging on about these kind of numbers.
We do because it is astonishing and utterly unprecedented. 
So what can we expect now? 
We heard much from Mr Sunak over the summer when he was standing for the leadership the first time around - where his key message was that Liz Truss's economic prospectus would be a disaster.
On that, he will be able to claim vindication.
But since that campaign much has changed - not least because of the consequences of Ms Truss's set of policies over the last few months.
And one of the many oddities of the last few weeks was a leadership race done at breakneck speed - start to finish in four days - in which we didn't hear a thing in public from two of the three wannabes.
Penny Mordaunt did give an interview to Laura Kuenssberg - but committed to little.
Boris Johnson said nothing.
And Mr Sunak said no more than the contents of a social media post saying he was in the running.
He has since addressed activists at Conservative HQ, but reporters weren't allowed in to ask questions. 
So much is yet to be revealed about how he'll govern and what his priorities will be.
His first big public moment will be at the recently much-used Downing Street lectern at just after 11:30 BST. 
It's the moment when all new prime ministers talk to the country and talk to the archive - the moment that will get played back weeks, months or years later when they leave and will be used to benchmark a point in history, if they're lucky. 
Mr Sunak has already emphasised the importance of ""integrity"" and ""humility"" - which sounds like he's trying to draw a contrast between his approach and how many perceived, respectively, his two (very) immediate predecessors. 
And then it'll be time to shape a government in his own image, while seeking to address the criticism levelled by many at Ms Truss for building an administration that froze out almost all supporters of Mr Sunak. 
Another thing being emphasised is the need for stability. 
Little wonder after the last few weeks.
But how does he achieve both of these things at once?
Were he to change home secretary, we'd have our third in a week.
Were he to change chancellor, we'd have our third in a few weeks. 
re is that economic statement currently in the diary for next Monday, 31 October.
Jeremy Hunt, the current chancellor, has said to prepare for very, very difficult choices.

ricky decisions with profound consequences, and many that are not likely to prove popular. 
And this for a party blamed by many for what's happened in the last few months, and one that is currently languishing in a desperate spot in the opinion polls.

But it's likely to be the necessary building block from which he can begin an attempt to tackle the colossal challenges the country faces.  "	/news/uk-politics-63381896
business	M&S warns of 'gathering storm' as shoppers squeezed	"Marks and Spencer has warned of a ""gathering storm"" of higher costs for retailers and pressure on household budgets as it reported a fall in profits for the first half of the year.
High Street giant said trading would become ""more challenging"" after it revealed its profits dropped by 24%.
It said ""all parts"" of retail would be affected by the UK's economic climate, adding unviable firms would go bust.
But M&S said its business could ""prove more resilient"" due to its clientele.
Many UK businesses are being hit by rising energy bills, wage costs and raw materials prices. 
Consumers are also cutting back their spending, with the Bank of England warning the UK is facing its longest recession since records began.
M&S said the ""combined impacts of the cost-of-living squeeze"" and the increased cost of doing business was ""creating pressure on margins industry-wide"".
But the retailer said that while it was prepared for tough times, M&S was in a stronger position than others due to a high number of its 30 million customers being in ""above average paid jobs or retired"".
""Whilst we are therefore planning on a material contraction in market demand, the M&S customer may prove more resilient than some market commentators assume,"" the company said.
""A high proportion of these are in above average paid jobs or retired. Despite the recovery in demand since the pandemic and return to travel these age groups shielded more and many retain a savings cushion.""
M&S said group revenue rose by 8.5% to £5.5bn in the six months to 1 October, with clothing and home sales doing well. 
But its profits were hit by higher overheads and a drop in online grocery sales through its partnership with Ocado, as shopping habits returned to pre-pandemic norms.  
Wearing a jumper under his suit on a website presentation, Archie Norman, the chairman of M&S, said it was a ""sign of the times"" and the heating had been turned down in the office by 1.5 degrees.
mpany has previously said its energy costs were up by £40m this year.
M&S said its full-year profits would be hit by its exit from Russia and the end of business rates relief, which was given by the government during the pandemic.
""Across all M&S markets it is highly likely that conditions will become more challenging in 2024,"" the firm added.
However, it said changes made to the business and ""reinvigorated"" product lines would provide ""some insulation from the gathering storm"".
M&S chief executive Stuart Machin told reporters that despite the challenges, its customers wanted to ""protect Christmas"" this year and would not cut back drastically.
Katie Bickerstaffe, co-chief executive, said velvet trousers, party wear and sequins were the most popular searched-for clothing items currently.
Customers had already bought about 30% of their Christmas gifts, she added, a trend which has been seen at other retailers.
It comes after George Weston, the boss of Associate British Foods, which owns Primark, said people were spreading their festive purchases this year ""across three or four pay days, rather than relying on cash that they have in hand in December"".
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said while the rising cost of living was hitting households, M&S's results showed that ""plenty of shoppers are still super-resilient and can be persuaded to part with their cash if the offer is right"".
""M&S has done a valiant job of keeping the tills brisk and virtual baskets filled up with the right product mix, offering value ranges interwoven with treats,"" she said.
She also said the firm's turnaround plan - which involves closing larger underperforming department stores and concentrating on smaller outlets where food is prioritised - was working. 
In October, Marks & Spencer announced it was speeding up a shake-up of its store estate, saying 67 of its bigger shops would shut within five years.

entertainment	Irene Cara: Fame singer and actress dies aged 63	"Fame and Flashdance singer Irene Cara has died at the age of 63.
American singer and actress was best known for her title track in the 1980 film Fame, as well as co-writing and singing the smash hit Flashdance... What a Feeling, for which she won an Oscar and a Grammy.
She later starred in films opposite Clint Eastwood and Tatum O'Neal. 
Cara's publicist, who announced her death, said she died at home in Florida but the cause is ""currently unknown"".
Born in 1959 in the Bronx, New York City, Cara was the youngest of five children and started her career on Spanish-language TV. Her father was Puerto Rican and her mother, Cuban-American.
Having recorded music as a child, both in Spanish and English, she went on to appear in a number of on-and-off Broadway musicals. 
But it was in 1980 that Cara shot to fame when she bagged the role of Coco Hernandez - and sang Fame's title track. 
Her performance earned her a Best Actress nomination at the 1981 Golden Globe Awards. 
Cara later co-wrote and sang the vocals for Flashdance… What A Feeling, from the 1983 blockbuster Flashdance, and won a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance as well as an Academy Award for Best Original Song.
Flashdance went on to become the third-highest-grossing film of 1983.
Judith A Moose, Cara's publicist, praised her  as a ""beautifully gifted soul whose legacy will live forever through her music and films"".
She also said Cara had been working on forthcoming projects when she died, which she and the singer's manager now plan to finish.
""She'd want that,"" Ms Moose said of her client via her official Twitter page. "	/news/world-us-canada-63767710
business	Crown Resorts: Casino firm fined over illegal China dealings	"Australian gaming operator Crown Resorts has been fined A$80m ($57.4m; £45.6m) for illegally accepting Chinese bank cards at its casino in Melbourne.
Regulators say the transactions were falsely classified as hotel services.
r money laundering and excessive gambling casinos in Australia are not allowed to accept bank cards.
Crown acknowledged its ""historic failings"" and says its top executives were in the process of reforming how the company operates.
On Monday, the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission (VGCCC) said Crown had breached Australia's casino regulations by allowing gambling funds to be withdrawn using credit or debit cards.
regulator found that Crown had processed A$164m Australian dollars in China UnionPay card payments, drawing in A$32m of revenue in the process, between 2012 and 2016.
It said the transactions were falsely classified as ""services"" provided by the Crown Towers hotel in Melbourne.
However, patrons were given vouchers that could be exchanged for cash or chips at Crown's neighbouring casino.
According to the regulator, the ""clandestine"" scheme also allowed some Chinese nationals to spend more in foreign currencies than was allowed under Chinese law.
""Crown benefited handsomely from its illegal conduct,"" VGCCC chairwoman Fran Thorn said in a statement.
""The fine will ensure that Crown is stripped of the revenue it derived from the process and will send a clear message that it must comply with its regulatory obligations,"" Ms Thorn added.
In response, the gaming group said its board and senior management were ""committed to the delivery of a comprehensive reform and remediation programme to ensure Crown delivers a safe and responsible gaming environment"".
Crown - which operates integrated resorts in Melbourne, Perth and Sydney - is also under scrutiny from regulators who have alleged the company had knowingly dealt with criminal organisations then misled authorities about those dealings.
Its casino in Melbourne is currently only allowed to operate under the supervision of a government-appointed manager.

business	Elon Musk warns Twitter deal stuck without fake account proof	"Elon Musk has said his $44bn deal to buy Twitter may be in jeopardy due to a disagreement over the number of fake accounts on the social media platform.
Mr Musk tweeted that the deal ""cannot move forward"" unless Twitter backs up its claims that less than 5% of daily users are fake or spam accounts.
witter has defended its figures, adding that Mr Musk waived rights to ""due diligence"" to clinch the deal.
raised doubts about the takeover.
Analysts have speculated that Mr Musk may be looking for ways to renegotiate the price of the deal or walk away.
Mr Musk agreed the $44bn (£34.5bn) deal to buy Twitter with its board in April, but last week Mr Musk said the deal was ""on hold"" while he sought details about fake accounts.
He has continued to press the issue in tweets and public appearances, while also hinting that he could seek a lower price.
On Tuesday, Mr Musk said Twitter boss Parag Agrawal had ""publicly refused to show proof"" that fewer than 5% of its accounts were fake, and said the deal ""cannot move forward"" until Mr Agrawal does show proof.
Mr Musk's tweet then appeared to be deleted.
re, who also runs carmaker Tesla, has put the number of fake accounts at 20% or more.
Elon Musk has doubled down on his position that his deal to buy the social network is on ice while the actual amount of spambots and accounts operating on it is investigated.
witter chief executive Parag Agrawal has hit back, and tempers are flaring.
When the richest man in the world replies to one of your tweets with just one symbol, the poo emoji, well, I suppose at least you know you've got his attention.
I long ago gave up trying to read the mind of Elon Musk but let's indulge in a moment of speculation.
He's making a big deal about fake accounts. Is it a convenient peg on which to hang a renegotiation? His initial $44bn offer for the firm was considerably higher than its current stock suggests.
He moved swiftly and aggressively, perhaps even impulsively.
fund it, he's already had to sell a chunk of shares in one of his other companies, the electric car firm Tesla, and that in turn made a dent in the value of that company as it made other investors nervous.
If either party in the Twitter deal walks away now, there's a $1bn termination fee.
may sound like small change to a multi-billionaire - although Mr Musk maintains he is asset-rich rather than cash-rich - but it perhaps gives him leverage to successfully shave a few billion off the offer price, because $1bn is not small change to Twitter and its shareholders.
However, Mr Musk might be right to question Twitter's worth.
If it really isn't bloated with spam, then perhaps it has less potential to be made great again, a phrase that may sound familiar given that he has already indicated that he would like to re-instate former US President Donald Trump.
Mr Trump, by the way, has so far declined the invitation.
Mr Musk and Mr Agrawal have been publicly debating the spambot figures on Twitter but relations appear to have soured. 
On Monday, Mr Musk responded to Mr Agrawal's defence of the the firm's spam reporting with a poo emoji, later repeating his claim that Twitter was underestimating the figure.
Mr Musk has said he is concerned that advertisers on Twitter don't know what they are paying for.
""So how do advertisers know what they're getting for their money? This is fundamental to the financial health of Twitter,"" he wrote.
After putting his offer on hold Mr Musk told a conference in Miami on Monday that ""you can't pay the same price for something that is much worse than they claimed"".
He said that a deal is ""not out of the question"" at a different price but added: ""The more questions I ask, the more my concerns grow.""
witter has said it is committed to completing the deal at the agreed price. 
In a filing with regulators on Tuesday, it told shareholders that Mr Musk's apparent eagerness to get the deal done, even without ordinary research into the business, set him apart from any other potential suitors.
""Other potential [buyers] would require substantial due diligence, creating a delay and risk to reaching the signing of such a potential transaction,"" it said.
Mr Musk has called for tests of random samples of Twitter users to identify bots. He said ""there is some chance it might be over 90% of daily active users"".
Researchers have estimated that anywhere from 4% to 20% or more of the millions of Twitter profiles are fake.
witter shares on Monday closed more than 8% down at $37.39, sowing doubts that Mr Musk would go ahead with his acquisition at the agreed price.
Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that it ""looks increasingly likely that Elon Musk is positioning to renegotiate a sharply lower price tag for Twitter or even try and pull the pin on the deal"".
She said that establishing the number of real users on Twitter is considered ""vital to future revenue streams via advertising or paid for subscriptions on the site"".
""The volatility which has hit tech stocks and contributed to a sharp decline in Twitter's valuation is also highly likely to be part of the equation,"" Ms Streeter said, adding that Mr Musk is ""clearly rueing the timing of his rash offer to pay $44bn for the social network""."	/news/business-61432483
business	Christmas post hit as Royal Mail workers strike	"Firms have warned of the hit to Christmas sales as postal workers squeezed by rising costs fight for higher pay and better conditions.
Royal Mail workers walked out again on Wednesday, marking the third of six strike days across the festive season.
Lucy Bryant, who sells art products, uses Royal Mail for deliveries and says it's frustrating for her and customers when they don't arrive on time.
warning comes as rail workers and driving examiners walk out too.
Postal worker walkouts coincide with the busiest time of year for Royal Mail when people and businesses are sending Christmas cards and presents.
Lucy Bryant, who runs her small business Haus of Lucy from Brighton, says she supports the strikers as ""everyone has a right to fair pay"".
However, because she relies ""so heavily on the post"" to get products from suppliers and to send her art to customers, she says it ""has made my life very hard this Christmas season"".
Some artworks are getting through, and some aren't. ""There's almost no logic to what is getting through,"" she says.
Lucy had to re-order prints that didn't arrive at a cost to the business ""that is quite a big hit for me to take,"" she says.
""I'm not Banksy - yet,"" she adds.
Watch Make Sense of Strikes on iPlayer and find out more about why people are striking and whether industrial action works.
Pip Haywood, managing director of online card company Thortful, has calculated that each day of action is costing the firm up to £50,000 a day.
""It's meant we've had to staff up to protect our customers,"" she told the BBC, with three times as many requests for advice on delivery windows from shoppers than usual.
""So it's not just hitting revenue, it's adding cost and also causing brand damage.""
With the company relying on Royal Mail for about 80% of its business, she says the strikes mean the firm will miss its sales target for the year.
Some parcel companies claim the walkouts are having a knock-on effect, and forcing them to delay next-day deliveries as people and firms seek alternative ways to send their post.
DPD Group said: ""We are experiencing short delays to our next-day delivery service in a small number of locations, as a result of the industrial action at the Royal Mail, which has had a huge knock-on effect across the entire industry.""   
Evri, the delivery company formerly known as Hermes, said that severe weather, Royal Mail strikes and staff shortages are causing ""some localised delays"". 
While Yodel also said that deliveries are taking longer to some areas but did not specify why.
As well as holding strikes this week, 115,000 Royal Mail workers from the Communication Workers Union (CWU) will also take industrial action on 23 December and Christmas Eve.
ute has been going on since the summer and like all the industrial action across rail, the NHS, teachers, border staff and driving examiners, pay is a key issue.
A spokesman for Royal Mail said the company had made a ""best and final pay offer worth up to 9% over 18 months"". 
""Instead of working with us to agree on changes required to fund that offer and get pay into our posties' pockets, the CWU has announced plans to ballot in the New Year for further strike action.""
But a spokesman for the CWU said that Royal Mail has offered workers a 3% pay rise this year, 3% next year as well as an additional 2% if employees agree to ""the absolute destruction"" of terms and conditions.
union has said the strikes are partly about the ""Uberisation"" of the postal service, including ""widespread changes... introducing Uber-style owner-drivers, mail centre closures and changes to Sunday working"".
Many workers are seeking wage rises as the cost of living soars. The rate at which prices are rising, known as inflation, is running at nearly 11%, which remains close to a 40-year high.
On Tuesday, a separate set of figures from the ONS revealed that the gap between wage growth in the public and private sector is near a record high.
rage pay rise for workers in the private sector was 6.9% between August and October. That compares to wage growth of just 2.7% for public sector employees.
uesday's walkout by rail staff left services running at about a fifth of capacity, on a day when snow, ice and fog hampered road and air travel. 
Around half of rail lines are shut again on Wednesday, with no services at all in most of Scotland and Wales. 
first-ever nationwide strike by nurses is also expected to go ahead this week.
And on Friday, rail workers, buses, baggage handlers, highway workers and driving examiners will walk out.
government's emergency Cobra committee will hold its second meeting of the week later to discuss how to minimise the impact of the wave of industrial action.
Along with the rail industrial action on Tuesday and Wednesday, there will also be train strikes on Friday and Saturday.
rt of a long-running dispute between unions, rail firms, the government and Network Rail over pay, job cuts and changes to terms and conditions.
But the rail industry was hit by a drop-off in passenger numbers during the Covid pandemic, and it's under pressure to save money. Bosses say reforms need to be agreed, to afford pay increases and modernise the railway.
Network Rail wants to cut 1,900 jobs as part of changes to the way its maintenance teams work - although it insists most of this could be achieved by people leaving voluntarily.
RMT disagrees with some of the changes and wants a guarantee of no compulsory job losses."	/news/business-63961595
sports	Beijing Winter Olympics boycott: Why are the Games so controversial?	"Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics are taking place over the coming weeks.
China's human rights record has led some countries to declare diplomatic boycotts of the Games, which means their top officials won't attend. 
Winter Olympics take place from 4 February to 20 February, with about 3,000 athletes competing in 109 different events.
Winter Paralympics run from 4 March to 13 March, with about 750 competitors across 78 events.
China's government and businesses are spending $3.9bn (£2.95bn) on the Games, which are taking place in and around Beijing:
About 1.2 million cubic metres of artificial snow is being used because so little falls in the region. China has been criticised over the environmental impact. 
Because of Covid, competitors and officials are in secure ""bubbles"" and no spectator tickets have been sold to the public.
US, UK and Canada declared a diplomatic boycott, along with India, Australia, Lithuania, Kosovo, Belgium, Denmark and Estonia.
, but no ministers or officials are attending.
US said this was because of China's ""human rights abuses and atrocities in Xinjiang"" - against the province's Muslim population.
British MP Iain Duncan Smith, who represents the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, said: ""The Chinese government commits industrial-scale human rights abuses in the Uyghur Region, Tibet and sends near-daily military incursions into Taiwan's airspace. 
""We cannot lend any legitimacy to China's despotic regime.""
India declared a diplomatic boycott because one of the torchbearers was a Chinese army officer involved in a deadly skirmish with its troops on the border between the two countries. 
Japan has also said it isn't sending ministers to the Games, but it is sending Olympic officials. 
New Zealand, Austria, Slovenia, Sweden and the Netherlands are not sending government representatives, but say Covid is their reason.
France has been against a boycott. President Macron has said: ""I don't think we should politicise these topics, especially if it is to take steps that are insignificant and symbolic."" 
re have also been protests across the world against the Beijing Games by human rights activists.
Beijing government is accused of committing atrocities against the Uyghur Muslim population in the northwest province of Xinjiang. 
Human rights groups believe more than one million Uyghurs have been detained over the past few years in a large network of what the state calls ""re-education camps"", with hundreds of thousands sentenced to prison terms.
re is evidence that Uyghurs are being used as forced labour, and women are being forcibly sterilised. Some former camp detainees allege they were tortured and sexually abused.
Beijing is also accused of restricting the freedom of people in Hong Kong through new legislation including the Hong Kong National Security Law.
In its 2021 annual report, Human Rights Watch said that ""Beijing's repression - insisting on political loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party - deepened across the country"".
China has consistently denied violating human rights in Xinjiang, and has warned its most vocal accusers - such as the US and Germany - not to interfere in its ""internal affairs"" in Hong Kong.
It has spoken out most loudly against the US diplomatic boycott. 
China's Foreign Ministry said that the US had ""clearly violated the Olympic spirit"", and ""will pay a price for its erroneous actions"". However, it has not specified what this price might be.
Athletes and others attending the Games are being warned about security weaknesses in the app they have to use for daily Covid monitoring.
Cybersecurity group Citizen Lab said the app has weak encryption systems and that data loaded on it such as medical and travel histories could be exploited by hackers. 
Several countries have reportedly told athletes to leave their main devices at home and use burner phones at the Games.
Chinese state media have dismissed the concerns."	/news/explainers-59644043
technology	How are 'kamikaze' drones being used by Russia and Ukraine?	"Ukraine has accused Russia of using Iranian drones against civilian targets in Kyiv.
rry explosives which detonate on impact and are launched in waves, making it hard to defend against.
It's believed Russia has been using Iranian-made Shahed-136 drones in the Ukraine conflict since mid-September.
Also called the Geranium-2 by Russia, it has explosives in a warhead on its nose and is designed to loiter over a target until it is instructed to attack.
Shahed-136 has a wingspan of about 2.5m (8.2ft) and can be hard to detect on radar. 
It's unclear exactly how many Russia has, but the US has said Iran planned to send hundreds to Russia. Iran has denied doing so.
Russia was first reported to have used a Shahed-136 drone on 13 September, attacking targets near Kupiansk, a city in the Kharkiv region in the east of the country.
Later that month, it was used in attacks in the south. Debris from the drones were found in wreckage in Odesa and Mykolaiv. 
In October, Shahed-136 drones landed on civilian areas in the city of Bila Tserkva, south of Kyiv.
On 14 December, Ukrainian officials say they shot down over a dozen drones during a Russian attack on Kyiv.
Russia may be using these drones rather than cruise missiles because they are relatively cheap - about $20,000 (£17,800) each. 
Ukrainian armed forces have used small arms fire, heavy machine guns, portable anti-air missiles and electronic jamming devices to try and shoot down the drones. 
Ukraine's armed forces claimed on 25 October that they had shot down 223 Shahed-136 drones in the preceding 36 days, which is 85% of the total launched by Russia.
However, it is almost impossible to shoot down every single suicide drone, when they are sent in large numbers.
""They fly low and you can send them in waves. These swarms of drones are much harder to counter by air defences,"" military expert Justin Crump told the BBC.
It's not clear whether these have been used by Ukraine, but the US has said it is sending it 700 of its Switchblade kamikaze drones, and experts say kamikaze drones may have been deployed in recent attacks on a Russian military base in western Crimea, on an airbase near Sevastopol, and on ships in Sevastopol harbour.
Dr Marina Miron, researcher in defence studies at King's College London, says they may have been rudimentary drones made in Ukraine.
""If you look at the explosions in the attacks, they are quite small,"" she says. ""I suspect that these are homemade drones, which have had explosives strapped to them.""
Ukraine's main military drone is the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2. It is about the size of a small plane, has cameras on board, and can be armed with laser-guided bombs.
At the outset of the war, Ukraine had a fleet of ""fewer than 50"" of these, says Dr Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) think-tank.
US said it is sending Ukraine 700 Switchblade drones, which are also kamikaze drones. 
Russia also uses the ""smaller, more basic"" Orlan-10, which have cameras and can carry small bombs. 
For both sides - Russia and Ukraine - drones have been effective for locating enemy targets and guiding artillery fire toward them.
""Russian forces can bring their guns to bear on the enemy within only three to five minutes of an Orlan-10 drone spotting a target,"" says Dr Watling. An attack could otherwise take 20-30 minutes to carry out.
Dr Marina Miron says drones have allowed Ukraine to stretch its limited forces.
""If you wanted to seek out enemy positions in the past, you would have had to send out special forces units... and you might lose some troops,"" she says. ""Now, all you're risking is a drone.""
In the first few weeks of the war, Ukraine's Bayraktar drones were widely praised.
""They were shown attacking targets such as ammunition dumps, and played a part in the sinking of the Moskva [warship],"" Dr Miron says. 
However, the Bayraktar is a large and slow moving drone, and Russia has been able to counter it effectively with its air defence systems.
Military drones are expensive to replace - a single Bayraktar TB2 costs about $2m (£1.7m).
So, both sides - but especially Ukraine - also use small, commercial models, such as the DJI Mavic 3, which costs about £1,700. 
mmercial drones can be fitted with small bombs. However, they are mainly used to spot enemy troops and to direct attacks.
""Ukraine doesn't have as much ammunition as Russia,"" says Dr Miron. ""Having 'eyes in the sky' to spot targets and direct artillery fire means they can make better use of what they have.""
But commercial drones are much less capable than military ones. 
For example, the DJI Mavic's total flying distance is only 30km, and it can only fly for a maximum of 46 minutes. 
Russia is using electronic devices to counter them, says Dr Miron.
""Russian forces have the Stupor rifle, which shoots electromagnetic pulses,"" she says. This stops commercial drones from being able to navigate using GPS, she explains.

Russian forces have also used online systems, such as Aeroscope, to detect and interrupt communications between commercial drones and their operators.

Software used for check-ins, notes and the NHS 111 service was affected by the ransomware attack found on 4 August.
f executive of Oxford Health Foundation Trust (OH), Nick Broughton, said it has done all it can to maintain services despite the disruption.
Software provider Advanced said disruption could continue for weeks.

""We have done all we can do to maintain services and maintain the safety of those services.""
rust said replacement systems are in place, but are time consuming and more people have had to be employed as a result, impacting agency spend.

health	Dorset patients offered targeted lung cancer tests	"People in Dorset are being offered tests for lung cancer as part of a national screening programme which is being rolled out in the county.
Patients at Royal Manor Health Care GP surgery on Portland are the first to be assessed for possible lung scans.
More than 40 areas in England are trialling the checks for current and former smokers aged 55-74.
NHS England said the Targeted Lung Health Check programme would cover all areas of the country from 2024.
Lead nurse Hana Spencely said patients across Dorset would be texted over the next two to three years and invited for appointments to test their suitability for CT scans.
She said: ""What we want to do is find things at an earlier stage and primarily save more lives.""
In November, Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust in Hampshire said it picked up 80% of suspected cancers at a curable stage through the screening, compared to 30% before.
Lung cancer is the biggest cause of cancer deaths in the UK, accounting for about a fifth of cases.
Symptoms include a persistent cough, chest infection and breathlessness, although there are usually no signs in the early stages.

technology	Why the folding phone revolution has a way to go	"me last year I had just become the proud new owner of a folding phone - the Samsung Galaxy Flip3.
For the uninitiated, this is a handset about the size of an average smartphone, which folds in half. 
I told everybody who would listen that it was the phone I'd been waiting for since the Motorola Razr clam shell of 2004 - finally I'd have a device that would fit in my pocket again.
rteen months later, the dream is over. A couple of days ago the ""fold"" line suddenly got dramatically larger and turned silver, the lower half of the screen went green, the top half became unresponsive, and then an ominous black cloud began to spread around the screen. 
It is now what you might call an ex-phone.
I'm not the only one - there are dozens of people online sharing similar tales of woe. One recent contributor on Reddit wrote that their brand new device broke within five hours. 
Folding phones were unveiled to great fanfare in 2019. There was much industry speculation that this would be the device that would revitalise a stagnating smartphone industry, create a new buzz around handsets once again and persuade people to upgrade, as figures suggested they were holding on to their phones for longer, unenthused by homogenous black rectangles. 
Huawei and Samsung led the foldable charge and remain the market leaders. Other rivals are mainly in the Chinese market - budget brands such as Oppo, Xiaomi and Vivo. Apple remains notably absent from the scene.
I remember sitting in a structure the size of an aircraft hangar in Barcelona that year, with audible gasps as Huawei showed off its version, the Mate X - with a launch price of about £2,000.
I persuaded an incredibly nervous member of the Chinese tech giant's team to let me hold one, just for a few seconds, for a photo.
""Do NOT move the fold,"" he begged.
me year both firms delayed the launch of their new gadgets, Samsung at the last moment, when early reviewers reported broken screens.
But durability tests since then have showed improvement. Earlier this month Samsung unveiled the next generation of its foldables - the Fold4 - and promised tougher screens and improved water resistance. 
According to Samsung, the current generation should survive 200,000 folds. I can't prove it, and I am a heavy phone user, but I'm not convinced I opened mine that often in the 13 months I had it.
As for the ""folding revolution"" - well Samsung says it sold almost 10 million folding handsets in 2021 and there is certainly a fanbase for the devices online. However that same year, Apple sold more than 49 million iPhones in just three months, according to consumer data company Statista. So folding handsets are still a very small chunk of the multi-billion dollar smartphone industry.
""I haven't seen loads of broken foldables,"" Ben Wood of analysts CCS Insight tells me, ""but at a time when [our research shows] people are keeping their phones in the UK for four years or more, people are looking to have phones that last longer.""
g-time industry watcher is confident Samsung's new phones will have more longevity and, he says, manufacturers have to do something different if they are to compete with the ""freight train"" of a product that is Apple's iPhone.
""I really admire Samsung for saying we have to be bold, we have to do something different.
""Do we all need a foldable phone? Absolutely not. It's definitely for people who want something that looks different. The Flip in particular has a strong female bias.""
, which folds horizontally into a more compact, square device is certainly more sympathetic to being carried inside smaller pockets - or indeed lack of pockets altogether - that are often an unwanted feature of women's clothes.
I had no issues with my folding phone while it worked, and it was often a conversation starter because it was so unusual. I only ever met one other fellow Flip3 owner, a man on a train who asked me where I got the case for mine, because he kept dropping his (the shiny exterior is very slippery - mine also suffered some knocks).
""I've only ever seen those on the telly!"" said one lady who stopped me in a cafe to have a look. I asked her whether she wanted one, and she just laughed.
You can of course repair them - at a cost. The price of an inside screen repair is £309, according to the Samsung website - that's £90 more than the cost of a new screen on its standard device the S21. A new Flip3 handset is currently advertised at £899 if bought outright. Samsung also offers an insurance package which brings down repair costs.
But given the environmental impact of making smartphones - there are about 60 elements in a handset - not to mention soaring costs of living, longevity is more crucial than ever. Android and Apple software have been tweaked to keep older devices running for longer - Apple controversially even slowed down older iPhones in order (it said) to prolong the battery life.
In the current climate, a folding phone may feel like a risky approach to a device that millions rely on every day. I've gone back to a budget Android while I figure out my next move -  but I'm not sure I've fully closed the door on foldables."	/news/technology-62727710

technology	Breaking down barriers in the fight against cyber-crime	"Louise Meney was 12 when she discovered hacking while browsing the internet with her first computer.
More than two decades later she now dreams of making a living from it thanks to a pioneering new course designed to break down gender barriers.
Ms Meney is one of 77 women who signed up for the free programme, which is based at Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU).
And by the end of the year she will be able to pursue her dream of a career in in the booming cyber-security industry.
As well as meeting the soaring demand for experts, the qualification is also designed to challenge the make-up of the tech industry, where less than a quarter of professionals are female.
Recruits for the Women Do Cyber programme - a partnership between Cisco, Scottish Women in Technology (SWiT) and GCU - include students who are currently unemployed. 
upported by Police Scotland and the Scottish government.
Ms Meney was at secondary school when she started hacking after discovering a how-to website.
She told BBC Scotland: ""It is something I have always enjoyed doing but not from a bad perspective.
""I think people hear the word hacker and the immediately think 'bad guy who is going to steal my bank details'.
""There is a field of hacking that is ethical.
""We are the people who work to stop people from penetrating systems and getting access to information that they should not have."" 
Ms Meney, 36, aspires to work for a purple team which involves a mix of offensive and defensive security.
One area she hopes to specialise in is bug bounties, which are paid out if hackers can identify weaknesses in IT systems.
She described the course as the new challenge she had been looking for.
""I have always been a bit geeky,"" she said.
""I was working as a software engineer for the last few years but I was not enjoying it any more.""
Ms Meney found out about the new opportunity as she was still in touch with lecturers from the applied psychology degree she completed at GCU in 2017.
She said: ""When I was speaking to them it just seemed like the perfect course for me with my interests and background.""
Ms Meney, who lives in Milton, Glasgow, has been out of work since she contracted Covid early in the pandemic so she did not hesitate to register for the course.
former software engineer said: ""I am unable to predict how my body will react on a certain day.
""If my long Covid symptoms were playing up then I would not be able to perform on a technical test.""
She said she was open and honest in her application about her ongoing issues and praised the support she had received.
She added: ""It has given me a lot of hope and exposed me to people I would not have met otherwise.""
urse, which started last month, is aimed at women aged 18 and above, including those who are currently unemployed or underemployed.  
No previous knowledge or experience in technology or maths is required to become a Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate, which is industry recognised qualification.
Louise Morran is a defuelling project manager at the Hunterston B nuclear power plant in North Ayrshire.
It was shut down for the final time in January after generating electricity for 46 years.
, owned by EDF Energy, is undergoing a three-year process of defuelling with the spent nuclear fuel sent to Sellafield for reprocessing.
Ms Morran, from Kilmarnock, said her employers had been supportive of her enrolling on the course, given the vulnerabilities of the energy sector to a cyber-attack.
Her course work currently takes up one day during the week and a day at the weekend.
She added: ""It is good doing my full-time job at the same time because I can take what I am learning outwith work and then see how it could be applied to my day-to-day job.
""Cyber-security is only going to get more and more important."" 
Ms Morran, 30, highlighted the shift to home working and a massive increase in internet use during the Covid lockdowns as potential weak spots which could be exploited by criminals.
She has been familiar with gender gaps since her early student days when she was one of just four women on her electrical and mechanical engineering course  at the University of Strathclyde.
She said: ""It was quite obvious from the start but I have noticed more recently through my work that more of the apprentices coming into the energy industry are female."" 
re are no such issues on the GCU course and Ms Morran described the number of women involved as ""amazing"".
Asked if she had a message for those considering it, she replied: ""Go for it. Stop doubting yourself.""
Cyber-crime is a global threat and is one of the biggest challenges facing law enforcement.
Lone hackers and gangs use sophisticated scams to target individuals, businesses and essential services.
More than 400 cyber-attacks were reported in Scotland in 2020/21 and notable recent victims include the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) and the charity SAMH.
UK's National Crime Agency said cyber-criminals sought to exploit human or security vulnerabilities in order to steal passwords, data or money directly. 
most common threats include:
Hacking - including of social media and email passwords
Phishing - bogus emails asking for security information and personal details
Malicious software - including ransomware through which criminals hijack files and hold them to ransom
Distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks against websites - often accompanied by extortion
NCA said most cyber-attacks could be prevented by taking these basic security steps: 
Chioma Uzoamaka hopes a career in cyber-crime will allow her to balance her work and busy family life.
former business analyst has four children aged between seven and 10.
Ms Uzoamaka, 41, previously worked in network security and is enjoying the new course.
She said: ""It is a good start for me to help fight crime and I hope it will encourage more women to work in cyber-security.""
Course mentor Ashley Beck said the threat was incredibly difficult to manage as so many more people were now online.
former detective added that law enforcement needed support to keep up with a complex and ever-growing landscape.
Ms Beck, who is now a senior law enforcement consultant, added: ""Everybody thinks it is just big companies that get targeted but actually you are talking about people downloading applications that actually give organised criminal groups access to everything that you click on on your device.
""It could be your banking app or anything like that.""
Silka Patel, founder of SWiT, believes the course will have a positive impact as only 23% of Scotland's tech workforce is currently female.
She added: ""Diversity should not be an afterthought, it should be built in from the beginning.
""This course helps women feel like they belong in the sector.""
Dr Salma Mohamed, lecturer in cyber-security networks at GCU, is confident the programme will help to change perceptions of hacking.
She said: ""The first image you have is this person who is male with a hood just sitting at a computer.
""We just need to make this image disappear and prove that there is this opportunity that we can have a female that can do the job but, of course, ethical hacking.""
Dr Mohamed said cyber-crime increased during the pandemic and revealed she was targeted by a bogus caller who said he was from HMRC.
Police Scotland has described the fight against cyber-crime as a national priority.
Chief Supt Faroque Hussain said: ""It poses a real and substantial threat to our communities and businesses and having a legacy in this academic course to upskill women on the subject is a meaningful reflection of the preventative measures we are taking.
""The women on this programme will learn about the real and present danger posed by the online arena. 
""Having their knowledge underpinned with academic rigour will hopefully gain them entry into digital-security-related employment where they can make a direct contribution to the country's cyber-capability.""
r officer also donated laptops to students who didn't have access to one.
Chief Supt Hussain added: ""With cyber-crime reports almost doubling in a year with an increase of 95%, we need to take action now to protect people from digital harm and crimes in the virtual world."""	/news/uk-scotland-61784130

made up of about 20 people, usually MPs but sometimes members of the House of Lords. They are known as ministers, or in some cases, secretaries of state, depending on the job. 
For example, the finance minister - who goes by the title chancellor of the exchequer - decides how much money you will be taxed and where that money will be spent, while the home secretary looks after UK borders and policing. 
jobs are often given to the PM's friends and supporters. It's called a ""reshuffle"" when lots of the ministers are moved around, promoted or fired. Ministers can move between very different departments, so for instance they could move from transport to culture.
So the health secretary doesn't need to have worked as a doctor or nurse, for example. They take advice and decide what the department does. They take into account how much money needs to be spent, whether it's what the government promised they'd do, and how it affects voters.
Each department works with civil servants - people who aren't elected politicians or loyal to any political party. They work to make the government's plans happen.
meets weekly around a long table covered in deep green felt and there's a carved chair for every minister. The PM sits in the middle and where everyone else sits is said to indicate how important they are.
But it can be a big political risk. If things go wrong in their department, ministers are usually expected to take the fall and resign.  "	/news/uk-63385259

w will resume filming next year and will then be available in the UK and US on Amazon Freevee, the company's free streaming service.
Neighbours is ""a unique series with a powerful connection with its fans across the world"", Amazon said.
fans had thought it was over when its star-studded finale aired in July.
Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan and Guy Pearce were among the old favourites who returned for what was thought to be the last episode, in which all the houses on Ramsay Street were up for sale.
But Stefan Dennis (Paul Robinson), Alan Fletcher (Karl Kennedy), Jackie Woodburne (Susan Kennedy) and Ryan Moloney (Toadfish Rebecchi) will be among the cast members returning to the Melbourne street for the new series. 
Fletcher said it was ""incredible news"" and Donovan said he was ""thrilled"".
However, actor Takaya Honda, who played David Tanaka, told his social media followers that many former members of the cast had not been told about the relaunch.
He posted a picture of Fletcher, Woodburne and Moloney on Instagram, writing: ""Apart from these three and Steffan [sic] the rest of the cast are finding out with you. Please give us time to process. We don't know anything more.""
Fletcher, Woodburne and Moloney are currently booked to say farewell to UK fans in person in Neighbours: The Farewell Tour next March.
Reacting to the news, the team behind the tour tweeted: ""First things first, we are thrilled that Neighbours is coming back. As for The Farewell Tour, it will absolutely be going ahead as planned - we just need a new name.""
Speaking to BBC News, the show's producer Dean Elliott added: ""Now we can have an even bigger celebration next year, turning what was already going to be an amazing look back at the iconic soap into an even bigger celebration of its return and its future.""
V critic Scott Bryan told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""This will be, I think, the first time that a big streamer has invested a significant amount of money in a soap. Normally it's a limited series. A limited series is generally quite low stakes because if it doesn't get the hits that you want for that show, you just easily cancel it.
""Soaps are actually really quite expensive commitments because, even though each episode is quite cheap, you've got so many different cast members, you've got to have a permanent base, it's a big crew.""
w series will be on subscription service Amazon Prime Video in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, while it will be once again broadcast on TV channel Network 10 in Australia. Previous episodes will also be available to stream.
Amazon executive Lauren Anderson said: ""Neighbours has captivated its audience for nearly 40 years, building a dedicated and loyal following for the lives and stories of the characters on Ramsay Street.
""With the power of streaming, we're able to offer a catalogue of thousands of Neighbours episodes for new audiences to discover this legendary series and current fans to relive their favourite moments.

technology	'I wouldn't leave South Africa, I have a kid here'	"Software firm boss Stanford Mogotsi says he remains committed to South Africa, despite the challenges of running a small IT firm in the country.
""It's my home, I have a kid, I have a family here,"" says the 47-year-old.
Mr Mogotsi co-owns Johannesburg-based software company Nane Solutions with his friend and business partner Kabelo Mashishi, 44.
Both have come a long way since growing up in one of South Africa's townships during apartheid.
Each studied computer science at university, and then spent a number of years in corporate IT jobs, before launching Nane in 2006.
r initial work was consultancy - advising firms such as MTN, South Africa's largest mobile phone network, and state-owned power company Eskom.
But they found consulting frustrating because they wanted to build software from the ground up, rather than just advise.
r first major foray into designing software was creating a system for world football governing body Fifa to manage volunteers at the 2010 World Cup, which was held in South Africa.
2017 they created software that helped brewing group Heineken improve its transportation system in the country. Another big project win was developing an app for phone service Talk360.
Yet it hasn't all been plain sailing for the firm. Nane means eight in Swahili, and the name was chosen because the company had eight founders.
However, the shift from consulting to the risker business of software development, and then the impact of South Africa's tough coronavirus lockdowns, resulted in all but Mr Mogotsi and Mr Mashisi leaving the business.
""It's really difficult to win work when you are a small firm,"" says Mr Mogotsi. ""We have to compete with multinationals, and potential clients tend to want to go for these tried and tested big IT firms, especially when the economic backdrop in South Africa is uncertain.""
Prof Duncan Coulter, head of the Academy of Computer Science and Software Engineering at the University of Johannesburg, agrees that times are difficult for South African IT companies like Nane.
While Mr Mogotsi and Mr Mashisi are staying in South Africa, Prof Coulter says that the continuing big problem for the country's IT sector is a brain drain - people finding jobs overseas.
""A lot of our better students are now off in Europe, America and Asia, are doing very well for themselves, we're very proud of them,"" he says.
""And as part of the general brain drain [away from South Africa], they definitely have opportunities to move more easily than professions like lawyer and doctors.""
As a result of all these young IT professionals finding work overseas, Prof Coulter says that firms in the sector in South Africa can now struggle to fill positions.
Mr Mashisi says that ""salary-wise we can't compete"" with what large firms overseas can offer. ""So as soon as someone's got a year or two's worth of experience, then it's easy for them to be snapped up [and go abroad].""
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
Yet despite this brain drain, South Africa still has successful software start-ups that are producing popular products.
An example of this is the app EskomSePush, which warns users across South Africa when to expect power cuts.
Such power cuts or ""load-sheddings"" are a regular occurrence in the country, due to the continuing energy generation shortfalls at power firm Eskom.
Sometimes people have to go without power for 10 hours a day, and there's no end in sight, with shortfalls due to continue until 2027.
EskomSePush is the brainchild of co-founders Dan Wells (35) and Herman Maritz, who launched the app in 2015 and run it from their Cape Town homes.
It collects and processes complicated load-shedding schedules from Eskom and local governments across South Africa. Notifications are then sent out to the app's users telling them exactly when the power will be out in their neighbourhood and for how long.
Mr Wells says that within six months of launching the app 250,000 people had downloaded it, ""which was crazy back then"".
He adds that today the app is ""on seven million devices, and about a million people will click on a notification almost immediately"".
monetised through advertising revenues, and Mr Wells' advise for software developers is ""gain a taste for having problems, find your community and solve some problems"".
If there is one thing that unites South Africans it is a love of sport, with cricket being the third most popular in the country.
At the University of Johannesburg, computer science lecturer Tevin Moodley and Prof Dustin van der Haar, have developed a cricket video software system that aims to help produce the next generation of world-beating South African batsmen and women.

politics	Rishi Sunak defends return of Suella Braverman to Home Office	"Rishi Sunak has defended re-appointing Suella Braverman as home secretary days after she quit over data breaches.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the new PM of doing a ""grubby deal"" with Ms Braverman to secure her support in the recent Tory leadership contest.
He also asked if officials had raised concern over the appointment.
Mr Sunak avoided the question but argued bringing Ms Braverman back into cabinet brought ""experience and stability"" to government.
A No 10 spokesperson later denied reports that Simon Case - the head of the civil service - had been ""livid"" about the appointment. 
king his first Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Sunak justified his decision telling MPs: ""The home secretary made an error of judgment but she recognised that, she raised the matter and she accepted her mistake.""
Starmer welcomes Sunak as the first British Asian prime minister, calling it a “significant moment""
He hit back at the Labour leader, accusing the party of being ""soft on crime and in favour of unlimited immigration"".
Sir Keir pointed to his own experience as head of the Crown Prosecution Service adding: ""I know first hand how important it is that we have a home secretary whose integrity and professionalism are beyond question.
""He's so weak, he's done a grubby deal trading national security because he was scared to lose another leadership election - there's a new Tory at the top but as always with them party first, country second.""
Liberal Democrats have also been critical of the appointment with the party's home affairs spokesperson Alistair Carmichael saying: ""A home secretary who broke the rules is not fit for a Home Office which keeps the rules.""
SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused the prime minister of doing ""a sleazy backroom deal to shore up his own position"".
Opposition parties are calling for investigations - the Liberal Democrats want an inquiry into Ms Braverman's appointment ""including any promises Sunak made to her behind closed doors"", while Labour wants one into possible security breaches by the home secretary.
Some Conservative MPs have also privately expressed their concern to the BBC about the decision.
During an urgent questions on the subject in Parliament, Labour MP Angela Eagle asked if an independent ethics adviser would investigate Ms Braverman's behaviour.
Cabinet Office minister Jeremy Quin replied that Mr Sunak did intend to appoint a new adviser - the previous holder of the role quit earlier this year - but added that ""events in the last administration would not be properly part of the remit of the new independent adviser"".
SNP's Ian Blackford says new PM Sunak did a ""sleazy backroom deal"" with Braverman to gain post
Ms Braverman stepped down last week amid the final days of Liz Truss's short-lived and chaotic premiership.
In her resignation letter, she admitted committing a ""technical infringement"" of the rules by sending an official document to someone not authorised to receive it. 
""I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility; I resign,"" she wrote.
Her letter also hinted at disagreements with Ms Truss over immigration policy expressing concern that the government was not delivering on commitments to tackle illegal migration. 
However, on his first day as prime minister Mr Sunak re-appointed Ms Braverman as home secretary.
It came three days after Ms Braverman had thrown her support behind him in the contest to replace Ms Truss, in what was widely seen as a significant endorsement by an influential MP on the right-wing of the Conservative party. 
Asked if Ms Braverman had been given the job as a reward for supporting the new PM, Foreign Secretary James Cleverly told the BBC Mr Sunak had strong support from MPs in the contest adding: ""I doubt he needed any particular individual endorsement.""
What's behind Suella Braverman's comeback and what does it mean for policy?
It's clear what she wants to do in the job - in her resignation letter to Liz Truss she said she had ""serious concerns"" over whether the government was committed to reducing overall migration numbers and stopping illegal immigration. 
At the Tory conference she talked about her ""dream"" of making the Rwanda policy work and wanting to eventually get immigration levels down to the tens of thousands. 
Remember Liz Truss was poised to make an announcement on immigration policy as a way of trying to stimulate economic growth - something over which she was reportedly at loggerheads with Suella Braverman.
For Rishi Sunak, getting Suella Braverman's backing was a key moment in the truncated leadership campaign - and returning her to one of the great offices of states is an overture to the right of the party. 
He talked a lot about asylum seekers during the leadership contest over the summer - but less so about immigration, so we don't know much yet about his thinking. 
But it's interesting he's put one of his long-term allies - Robert Jenrick - in the Home Office as immigration minister.
Perhaps his eyes and ears in the department, someone to make alternative arguments or shape one whole policy area. 
One to watch. 
row over Ms Braverman's new job, came as MPs on the Home Affairs Committee heard evidence on Channel crossings.

Instead MPs heard from Dan O'Mahoney - the Home Office's clandestine Channel threat commander - who told the committee that 38,000 people have arrived in the UK so far this year in small boats - an increase compared to last year's figure of 28,526.
mmittee also heard that around 93% of people arriving in small boats this year have claimed asylum. However, there is a backlog in processing claims and only 4% of applications from 2021 have been processed. 
Mr O'Mahoney also noted there had been a huge increase in the number of Albanians arriving in the UK illegally - 21,000 in the UK this year, compared to 50 in 2020. "	/news/uk-politics-63397590

Great Clock of Westminster, widely known as Big Ben - which is actually the name of the bell, will be changed early on Sunday morning.
It has been largely silent for five years, after it was dismantled and repaired in a renovation project.
Clocks across the UK will go back an hour at 02:00 on Sunday, offering many people an extra 60 minutes in bed.
If you were expecting a spectacle of Big Ben's hands being wound back, you will be disappointed.
going to happen - instead, it will be manually paused, with lights on the four clock faces turned off at 22:00 on Saturday.
k will be stopped and restarted at midnight. The lights will then come back on at 02:00, when the correct time will be displayed.
""This is so people looking up do not wonder why the hands are going round and get confused,"" said clock mechanic Alex Jeffrey.
Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said the time change would ""herald a new beginning"" for the iconic London landmark.
He hailed the team behind the scenes, which will work for 24 hours to ensure all 2,000 timepieces across Parliament are changed in time.
While most of us are tucked up in bed, they will be ""clocking up eight miles [13km] changing our parliamentary clocks, including the one we love the most, the Great Clock of Westminster"", Sir Lindsay said.
He added: ""For the first time in five years they will be working with the clock's completed original Victorian mechanism, so it is a significant final moment in the conservation of this magnificent timepiece.""
utumn, the clocks go back by one hour at 02:00 on Sunday 30 October.
ks are moving from British Summer Time (BST) - also known as Daylight Saving Time (DST) or GMT+1 - to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
Well, according to BBC Bitesize, ""during World War One, the German army turned the clocks forward as a way of conserving energy. Many (but not all) European governments followed suit shortly afterwards - including the UK.""
rhaul project - which saw the Big Ben bell silenced for all but a select number of occasions over the past five years - was ordered to restore, repair and conserve parts of the clock and tower damaged by pollution, asbestos and natural wear and tear.
Elizabeth Tower that houses the clock was finally free of its scaffolding in April this year. At that point the clock hands were restored, so Londoners and visitors alike could once again look up to check the time.
work was due to be completed in 2021, but its finish was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.

""It's been a long time coming,"" Elson told BBC Radio Bristol. 
""Things are starting to click a little bit, we're turning a bit of a corner. We've gone up a division to the highest division here, that's a jump from last year where we were. 
""We brought a big chuck of those guys that were on last year's team that had a big year with us. It's just taken some guys some time to customise themselves and get them up to that new level of play, it's obviously at a higher level. 
""We've got a number of new guys in the group. We had to recruit more guys than any team in this league this summer. It's been a bedding in period but we feel like we're getting there.""

politics	Scottish budget could lead to service cuts, councils warn	"Some local services may have to be scrapped due to funding shortages, council leaders have warned following the Scottish government's budget.
Local authority chiefs have unanimously backed a motion arguing the budget will be detrimental to services.
It follows Deputy First Minister John Swinney announcing that councils will benefit from a funding increase of £550m.
Scottish government says its budget will ensure councils are ""protected"".
In his budget announcement, Mr Swinney said that local authorities would receive more than £550m extra - instead of a flat cash settlement.  
At a meeting of the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla), the leaders said that most of that sum was for existing commitments - claiming the settlement meant another massive real-terms cut in funding, leaving them ""extremely disappointed"".
urged ministers to prioritise local government funding and pause plans for a National Care Service, which is expected to cost between £664m and £1.2bn over five years. 
Council chiefs said funding should instead be reallocated to social care and prevention measures within local government.
Katie Hagmann, Cosla's resources spokeswoman, said: ""Council services will now be at absolute breaking point and some may have to stop altogether.
""This is a result of cuts to our councils' core budgets and direction on spend towards other Scottish government priorities over the last few years.
""Yesterday's budget announcement compounds this and there is a real risk that many of our essential services will not only be cut, but may have to stop altogether.""
Analysis published by Cosla suggests the cash increase could be just £71m once Scottish government-mandated policies are paid for, while it claims capital funding will remain flat for next year. 
Fraser of Allander Institute said the funding was equal to a 4.9% real-terms decrease based on spending last year, while the Institute for Fiscal Studies accused the government of overstating the spending increases by comparing spending next year to last year's budget and not taking into account in-year rises.
But the Scottish government rejected the claims by Cosla.
A spokeswoman said: ""We have protected councils in the most challenging budget since devolution to provide more than £13.2bn in the 2023-24 local government settlement.
""This represents a cash increase of over £550m, or 4.5%, which is a real-terms increase of £160.6m, or 1.3%.""
As part of the budget announcement, local authorities were also given full flexibility to set their own council tax rates.
Mr Swinney said councils should ""consider carefully the cost pressures facing the public"" when deciding the rate they will charge people.
Scottish Conservative local government spokesman Miles Briggs said: ""Services that residents rely on could be lost forever under John Swinney's current budget proposals. He should stop with the shameless spin and instead step up and ensure our councils have the funding they need.
""While tough decisions have to be made, our councils should not always have to bear the brunt of SNP-Green cuts. Many of them simply have no more room to manoeuvre when it comes to managing their finances, while still delivering local services."""	/news/uk-scotland-63999676

sports	Tokyo Olympics: Sport climbing - was it a success?	"Speed, bouldering and lead. The route to Olympic glory in sport climbing literally embodies the recently revised Olympic motto 'faster, higher, stronger, together'.
And it was the top trendingexternal-link Olympic sport on Google Search during its opening day of competition - suggesting it quickly grabbed people's attention.
International Olympic Committee's (IOC) decision to introduce five new sports for Tokyo 2020 was billed as ""the most comprehensive evolution of the Olympic programme"" in modern history.
It was hoped a ""focus on youth"" with baseball, karate, skateboarding, sports climbing and surfing would capture the imagination of viewers around the world and adapt the Games for the 21st Century.
Skateboarding has thrived as young talents - including Britain's 13-year-old bronze medallist Sky Brown - dazzled with world-class skill and inspiring scenes of camaraderie.
But how has climbing, the last of the new sports to make its appearance in Tokyo, fared on its Olympic debut?
ree disciplines of sport climbing are usually tackled separately in elite competition, however in Tokyo they were combined to determine an all-round champion.
In speed climbing, athletes race each other up a 15-metre wall, while bouldering pits the competitors against technical fixed routes that must be tackled within a set time. 
If that was not enough, lead challenges the competitors to climb as high as they can in a single attempt on a 15m wall, within six minutes.
format was described pre-Games by Team GB's sole representative Shauna Coxsey as ""like asking Usain Bolt to run a marathon and then do the hurdles"".
""The scoring is not the best it could be,"" American Colin Duffy said, following a seventh-placed finish in the men's final. ""But in 2024 it will be a different format and hopefully it will work out a little better."" 
ring might be a headache for competitors, but its undoubtedly a spectacle for viewers - and with the average age of the sport's elite athletes being just 21 it certainly fits the IOC's youth objectives too.
On Thursday, 18-year-old Spaniard Alberto Gines Lopez made history by claiming the sport's first Olympic gold, becoming his country's youngest male Olympic champion in the process.
On Friday, Slovenia's Janja Garnbret, 22, claimed gold in the women's event.
maraderie evident at the skateboarding was mirrored at the Aomi Urban Sports Park - noticeably different from some of the fierce rivalries in more established Olympic sports.
""I think it all stems from outdoor climbing when you're climbing with your friends, you're working together to solve a problem and that carries over into competition,"" said American silver medallist Nathaniel Coleman.
""We're able to cheer for our friends, because we see them climbing, we see their struggle and we know how good it feels to do well, so we want that.""
Britain's Coxsey, who first encountered a bouldering wall when she was four-years-old, missed out on Friday's women's final after struggling with injury in qualification.
Despite her personal disappointment, the magnitude of contesting a climbing competition at an Olympics was not lost on Coxsey.
""It's a monumental time for our sport,"" the 28-year-old said. ""It is going to be seen by so many more people. If someone sees climbing and goes and finds something that they absolutely love and have a passion for, that's huge to that individual.
""The professionalisation of the sport is huge. Before me, no-one had ever been a professional competition climber in the UK, so that in itself is a change in the sport.""
Along with surfing and skateboarding, climbing will retain its place at the next Olympics in Paris, a Games which will also witness a debut for breaking - a competitive form of breakdancing.
A total of 40 athletes - 20 men and 20 women - competed for two gold climbing medals in Tokyo, but the sport is set to expand in 2024 when 68 athletes will challenge for four golds, as the speed event becomes a separate discipline.
With climbing walls already present in more than 140 countries, over 35 million climbers around the world, and interest piqued following a first exposure to a truly global audience, these are exciting times in the sport.
""We trained so hard for this, and we were really thankful that we got to show everything that we worked so hard for,"" Austria's men's bronze medallist Jakob Schubert said. 
""It means a lot to win a medal, and now a lot of people in Austria will watch climbing. I hope some more kids from all over the world will find this sport that gives us so much pleasure."""	/sport/olympics/58109892

technology	Heatwave: Why your phone overheats and how to prevent it	"fan is on, you've just finished your 10th iced coffee and are ready to scroll through your phone.
But your device is either slow, too hot or has a drained battery. Sound familiar?
Current record-breaking temperatures are not just affecting people's bodies, but also their electronics.
But, unlike humans, phones can't sweat - which is good for those who hold their phones but not great for our handsets.
So why do our electronics struggle in the heat and what can we do about it?
Much like how we struggle to operate at the same speed in intense heat, it can be something similar for the phone's processor - a chip inside that's responsible for its main functions.
""The internal things that actually make it all work, unfortunately, themselves generate heat in the way they work,"" says Dr Roz Wyatt-Millington, a senior lecturer in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Leeds Beckett University.
""And as the device gets hotter for phones, the processor tries to stop itself overheating, and it ends up slowing everything down as a result,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.
She says electronics are generally designed to work up to 35 degrees Celsius. 
""Batteries store energy and are designed to work at certain temperatures. The hotter they get, the harder they have to work and the more energy they use,"" says Dr Roz.
Which means the battery life gets drained more quickly, especially as it's harder to cool.
""They also use energy to monitor their own state, and basically have to do more work.""
Dr Roz adds we often turn up screen brightness when outside in the sunshine, which can also have an impact.
If you've noticed a slight change in your screen, the heat might have had an impact.
""If it's an older phone, if there's a slight defect in it, the heat will magnify it,"" says Dr Roz.
She adds that screen protectors can often hold more heat inside, which isn't good in hot conditions. 
Don't stick it on charge
""If it's really hot, when you are charging your battery, you are generating heat. When your device has been on charge, it ends up being hotter,"" Dr Roz says.
Position it smartly
""Keeping it out of direct sunlight helps. Don't leave it in your car, keep in the shade as much as possible. Put it in front of a fan if you can.""
Keep it light
utside of the phone. Take it out of a case and turn off all the functions you do not need.
""If you're not using the GPS, if you're not using stuff, turn it off. Because the less stuff you actually use, the less energy you're going to use, the less heat it's going to generate,"" she says.
Low power mode
wer you use, the better off your phone will be.
""Sometimes just simply, if your phone's really struggling, turn it off for a few minutes, just let it all cool down, and then turn it back on again.""
But do not use a fridge or freezer...
""Don't stick it in a bag of ice, because that doesn't help it."" 
Rapid temperature changes can be really bad for phones, and the ice can lead to water becoming trapped in it.
Dr Roz adds phones have overheat mechanisms built into them to stop them from ""destroying themselves, which can happen in really bad heat"".

business	Philippines lottery: Questions raised as hundreds win jackpot	"A lottery in the Philippines that saw 433 people hit the jackpot has drawn surprise and triggered scrutiny.
It was the highest number of people to have ever won the Grand Lotto's top prize, according to local media.
winning combination for last weekend's 236m peso ($4m; £3.5m) jackpot was a series of numbers which were all multiples of nine.
Philippines senate minority leader Koko Pimentel has called for an inquiry into the ""suspicious"" results.
Participants in the Grand Lotto select six numbers from one to 55. To win the jackpot, all six of a player's numbers have to match those drawn by the lottery's operator.
""These lotto games are authorised by the Republic of the Philippines. Therefore, we need to maintain and protect the integrity of these gambling games,"" Mr Pimentel said as he called for an investigation into the lottery's unusual outcome.
On Sunday, Melquiades Robles, general manager of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO), sought to reassure the public and said the drawing of winning numbers cannot be rigged.
PCSO also highlighted that people in the Philippines tended to bet on number sequences.
""Many have held on to their numbers. It's not only good to be loyal to your wives and husbands, it's also good to be loyal to your numbers,"" Mr Robles told a news conference.
PCSO also shared photographs and videos of people collecting their prize money at its office in Mandaluyong city, close to the capital Manila.
""I've been betting on pattern nine, pattern eight, pattern seven and pattern six for many years and I'm thankful I just won,"" one winner said.
rence Tao, a maths professor from University of California, Los Angeles told the BBC that a pattern like this being a winning series of numbers is rare ""for any single lottery"".
""But there are hundreds of lotteries every day around the world, and statistically it would not be surprising that every few decades, one of these lotteries would exhibit an unusual pattern,"" he said.
""It's similar to how in any given hand of poker it would be unlikely to draw a straight flush, but if one looks at hundreds of thousands of hands at once then it actually becomes quite likely that a straight flush would be drawn,"" he added.
It's not the first time a lottery has seen an unusual pattern or sequence of numbers drawn.
re were accusations of fraud after 20 people shared the jackpot in South Africa's national lottery in December 2020, when the numbers five, six, seven, eight, nine and 10 were drawn.
rganisers said the winners collected 5.7m rand ($370,000; £278,000) each.
Meanwhile, a Spanish TV reporter resigned live on air after she thought she'd hit the jackpot in the country's €4m ($3.9m; £3.4m) Christmas lottery.
Natalia Escudero started screaming on camera and told colleagues at public broadcaster RTVE she was ""not coming to work tomorrow"" - before later learning she had won just €5,000 ($4,349; £3,784).
And spare a thought for those whose lucky numbers came up in a lotto draw in the UK in March 2016.
More than 4,000 correctly picked five out of the six numbers - all multiples of seven - and ended up collecting just £15 each for their win.

business	Cough syrup deaths: India production halted after Gambia child fatalities	"Indian health officials have ordered a maker of cough syrups to halt production after they were linked to the deaths of children in The Gambia.
Maiden Pharmaceuticals broke rules ""across its manufacturing and testing activities,"" Indian regulators found.
World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert over four of Maiden's cough syrups linked to the deaths of almost 70 children.
Investigations are currently under way in India and The Gambia.
Regulators said that they had suspended all manufacturing activities at the New Delhi-based firm after finding it had broken a number of safety rules.
was ""in view of the seriousness of the contraventions observed during the investigation and its potential risk to the quality, safety and efficacy of the drug being produced,"" they added.
Maiden did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.
Last week, the company said it was ""shocked to hear media reports regarding the deaths and deeply saddened by this incident"".
me after the WHO issued a global alert over four of Maiden's cough syrups, warning that they could be linked to acute kidney injuries and the children's deaths in July, August and September.
global health organisation also warned the products ""may have been distributed, through informal markets, to other countries and regions"" besides The Gambia.
medicines were identified as Promethazine Oral Solution, Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup, Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup.
Police in The Gambia are investigating the deaths of the children, as Gambians demand justice.
President of The Gambia Adama Barrow said authorities would ""leave no stone unturned"" in their investigation.
In a preliminary report released on Tuesday, police in The Gambia said the cough syrups were imported to the West African country by a US-based company.
report also said that the majority of the 50,000 bottles of the contaminated syrups that were imported into the country had now been seized.

health	Gloucester: NHS boss says people have died waiting for ambulances	"An NHS boss has said people have died while waiting in the community for an ambulance.
Delays in paramedics reaching patients is partly due to handover delays at hospitals, an ambulance trust said.
Chief executive of Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Deborah Lee, said a decision had been made to ""bring the queue indoors"".
Some patients are being treated in corridors at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital to reduce handover delays.
Ms Lee said this was an extreme measure for extreme circumstances.
She told Gloucestershire's Health Overview Scrutiny Committee that it was safe to do this, but admitted it was not ""high quality care"" as ""nobody wants to be cared for in that setting"".
Ms Lee also admitted the situation was not sustainable but said handover times had improved and 90% were under an hour.
South Western Ambulance Service said it was working hard to reduce delays and working closely with partners to prevent them.
During the meeting at Shire Hall in Gloucester on Tuesday, councillors heard recruitment was a problem for Gloucester Royal Hospital.
Ms Lee said the NHS trust employed around 9,000 people but had a vacancy rate of 10%.
She said the trust had not given up on the ""goal of being fully recruited"" - but described urgent emergency care as the ""Achilles' heel"".
Gloucestershire's Police and Crime Commissioner Chris Nelson was at the meeting.
Mr Nelson said police officers were ""too often called out and then trapped"" at hospitals.
Det Supt Steve Bean said he had no problem helping the health service as a ""safety net"" - but said officers had been driving people to hospitals ""for months"".
Ms Lee said part of the problem at A&E was the number of patients ready to be discharged, blocking beds for new arrivals.
She said the Gloucester hospital had an average of 230 patients pending discharge.

health	Boots and balls made for men an injury risk to women footballers	"Sports scientists are highlighting the lack of football kit designed for women, saying the use of boots and balls created for male players could be putting them at higher risk of injury.
Knee-ligament injuries in women are causing concern at an elite level.
Despite some progress, the researchers say no large boot manufacturer has yet invested in a design to suit women.
rofile and popularity of women's football in the UK has soared since England won Euro 2022.
But most products are still predominantly designed for men's football and little attention has been paid to the requirements of the women's game, a paper says.
Writing in the journal Sports Engineering, a group of sports and exercise researchers, doctors and staff involved in the elite women's game - including England captain Leah Williamson - point to the need for more kit and technology tailored to women's needs and body shape.
For example, football boots fail to account for the fact women's feet, heels and arches are shaped differently.
And wearing boots designed for men is causing blisters and stress fractures in elite female players.
Women also move and run in a different way to men and yet the length of studs on boots are designed around male movement and traction. 
reases the risk of women getting their boot stuck in the surface and an injury being caused, author and sports rehabilitation lecturer Dr Kat Okholm Kryger, from St Mary's University, Twickenham, says.
Another factor in women's injuries could be playing ""on uneven surfaces where men's teams have played the day before"", Dr Kryger says.
Many major manufacturers are reportedly developing boots specific to women in time for the World Cup in 2023.
m Hotspur club doctor Craig Rosenbloom, who is also a co-author of the paper, says anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) knee injuries are ""at least twice as common in elite female footballers when compared to male footballers"".
utting ""a huge burden"" on the players and the clubs, he adds.
Most elite male footballers return within seven to eight months of the injury - but for elite female footballers, it is usually at least 10. 
""Elite female football squads are usually smaller than male squads, so missing players for longer has a big impact on player availability,"" Dr Rosenbloom says.
r also highlights the need to design more comfortable and practical sports bras, shorts and hijabs.
A number of clubs, including Manchester City, are switching to dark-coloured shorts for women because of worries over visible leakage when players are on their period.
FA says it wants players to feel fully supported on this issue and any feedback from women will be fed into future kit designs.
uthors say technology, such as devices tracking health, performance and menstrual cycles, needs to be better designed for women too.
And they call for more research into female players' concussion risk from heading the ball.
""There's a higher level of microtrauma in the white matter in women's brains,"" Dr Kryger says.
""That's not seen in men's football - so there could be a medical reason to change the ball."" "	/news/health-63636201

sports	Kelly Catlin: A family's search for answers on links between concussion and suicide	"In January 2019, on a sunny day in the coastal mountains surrounding San Francisco, an Olympic medal-winning cyclist was racing down a twisting ribbon of tarmac, descending at the kind of blistering speed reserved for cars and motorbikes.
On a surface that had dried quickly after the first rainfall for weeks, Kelly Catlin suddenly lost control.
Her bike flew out from underneath her and tumbled down the hillside, coming to a stop in a cloud of dust. She was carried forward and skidded across the road, tumbling several times. 
Catlin knew the drill of the hardened cyclist: jump up, survey the bike, examine the burning road rash and torn Lycra, get back up and finish the ride.
She seemed OK. She headed home. Later she spoke with her mum on the phone.
""She was telling me about it and kind of laughing,"" Catlin's mother Carolyn Emory told BBC World Service. 
""I asked her: 'Did you check your helmet?' 'No it's fine,' she said. But then she did check and it had dents on the front and back.""
Catlin didn't realise at the time, but she had suffered a concussion. Soon after, she began to experience painful and confusing symptoms. Her mood and behaviour changed, she became anxious and depressed. Her family was worried - she no longer seemed herself. 
wo months later, Catlin had taken her own life. She was 23. 
Looking for answers has been a long, painful and complex journey for her family. 
But they believe doing so will help raise awareness about an issue that sport - and especially cycling - has for too long ignored.
One of triplets, Catlin was a gifted athlete growing up. She seemed destined to achieve in almost any sport she liked. She was an especially talented football player, but when injuries saw her take up cycling as a way of keeping fit on the sidelines, there was no going back.
""It was like she was born with this drive or obsessiveness. Not to be an Olympic athlete necessarily, but to excel or to be good at something,"" says her father Mark.
""Anything she focused on, she really focused. Art, Chinese… With school assignments she would do it and go beyond. Cycling was the thing it got channelled into.""
By the time of her crash, Catlin was a postgraduate computer science student at Stanford University in California, a three-time world track cycling champion in the team pursuit and an Olympics silver medallist with the United States. 
She was out that day as part of her training with professional team Rally Cycling, one of America's best. She had no idea how seriously her injuries would go on to affect her.
Weeks afterwards, she was still in constant pain and discomfort. Doctors' diagnoses could not pinpoint exactly what was wrong.
""She went to Germany for a World Cup thing, but she couldn't do it because she had severe headaches,"" says Carolyn. ""She stayed an extra week after the team left because she couldn't cope with the airport lights and the noise."" 
Mark adds: ""She went to the Olympic Training Centre (OTC) and had a whole bunch of scans which didn't show up an awful lot.
""Then things went downhill. They put her on some therapy for dizziness, light sensitivity and headaches. She had eye exercises. They trained her with all sorts of monitors and oxygen and blood pressure - all that stuff. Something was definitely wrong.""
Catlin attempted suicide at the end of January 2019, but did not succeed. 
""Part of her brain knew it was too much after the first attempt,"" says Carolyn. ""She gave us her word she would not try again. 
""But she talked to her sister on the phone a couple of days before she killed herself and said she was still thinking about it. She referred to: 'If things don't change in a month…' 
""It was almost a goodbye."" 
Mark adds: ""She gave us her word, but in fact I think she just said that to get out of hospital. The staff realised it wasn't the right thing to do to let her go, but she was going to get a lawyer - she was determined to get out.""
Soon after Catlin's phone call with her sister, and following a campus wellness check initiated by Carolyn after a series of unanswered phone calls, Catlin was found dead in her apartment at Stanford in March 2019. 
Her father Mark believes his daughter would still be alive had her symptoms, which included depression and anxiety, been recognised as evidence of post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Catlin had suffered several concussions - the crash was not her first - but the link was not made.
If it had been, Mark believes, Catlin would have followed guidance to take several weeks' full rest, after which time, in many cases, PCS symptoms ease and patients recover. However, continuing to combine her cycling and studies, Catlin had been as busy as ever; determined to achieve, restless and intense in her pursuit of excellence, just like she always was.
Catlin's family believe the symptoms she was experiencing, combined with this complex edge to her personality, proved too much for her; a woman whose drive for perfection was focused on fulfilling potential.
According to the Washington Post,external-link her diaries later revealed she lived by a set of guidelines which included ""I do not cry"". 
We often see elite sport as the pinnacle of human performance. With it comes a perception that an athlete cannot be too dedicated in their pursuit of glory, that practice makes perfect. We think of their resilience or stoicism in the same way. A 'we go again' philosophy many champions possess.
Catlin referred to this herself in a blog post for the website VeloNews, published in late February 2019, shortly before her death.
She wrote: ""As athletes, we are all socially programmed to be stoic with our pain, to bear our burdens and not complain, even when such stoicism reaches the point of stupidity and those burdens begin to damage us. These are hard habits to break.
""The truth is that most of the time, I don't make everything work. It's like juggling with knives, but I really am dropping a lot of them. It's just that most of them hit the floor and not me.""
Brain injury remains poorly understood in the sporting world. Only in recent years has awareness begun to grow around the degenerative condition chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and its links with repeated blows to the head, and/or concussion. 
UK charity Headway has played a major role in developing interventions to mitigate against risks facing athletes, while also campaigning for wider understanding of post-concussion syndrome, too. 
Because while CTE tends to develop later in life, with symptoms similar to Alzheimer's disease and can currently only be fully diagnosed post-mortem, PCS is experienced in the immediate weeks or months after a concussion. 
A key phrase from Headway's campaign work is: 'If in doubt, sit it out.' The reality of the cycling world can often be found a long way from that message. 
In road cycling, a rider must quickly get back on their bike following a crash to avoid losing touch with the peloton and missing a time limit, causing elimination. 
Last year's men's road cycling season saw some high-profile instances of concussion - one during each of the three Grand Tour races. The most concerning came at the 2020 Tour de France, in which Frenchman Romain Bardet crashed on stage 13. 
He was contesting the lead of the race, but after crashing was clearly disorientated when he was lifted on to his feet, and his legs gave way and he collapsed. Within a minute he was back on his bike. He finished the 192km stage before it was revealed he not only had concussion, but had suffered a brain haemorrhage. 
Several of Catlin's USA Cycling counterparts have highlighted their concerns over concussions they suffered during their careers on the track, including 2020 world time trial champion Chloe Dygert and US time trial champion Carmen Small, who says her career was eventually ended by it. 
""All athletes want to keep pushing when they should probably stop,"" Small has said. ""I still have headaches. I was never diagnosed, but I remember being out of it for four days in a dark room and having vertigo for six weeks.""
Since Catlin's death, USA Cycling has launched a wellbeing programme and ""multiple strategic initiatives aimed at changing the narrative around mental health"".
re are some other early signs of progress. 
On Friday, the UK government published new plans to develop protocolsexternal-link around concussion in sport, following a July report from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. 
Cycling's governing body the UCI has introduced new measures to better ensure the safety of athletes following head injuries. Team members will be trained to recognise the signs of concussion, record every incident centrally and follow a set time limit for recovery and returning to competition.  
And during this year's Paris-Nice, Britain's 2020 Giro d'Italia champion Tao Geoghegan Hart was pulled out of the race after his team Ineos Grenadiers opted for caution - a move which was widely praised.
Following Catlin's death, her parents donated her brain to the Concussion Legacy Foundation Brain Bank at Boston University to aid further research into the effects of concussion. 
In a statement released at the same time, her father Mark identified four areas of possible cause: Personality, stress, overtraining and concussion. 
Mark says: ""Kelly was such a complex individual and very private - one who kept a lot of feelings inside and kept a veneer of: 'I'm an iron woman.' 
""She wouldn't reveal her emotional or psychical situation, probably to anybody. She kept pushing herself when she shouldn't have been. It all had a cumulative effect on her, a very strong woman brought down by that combination.
""It's like part of us is torn out. I wake up every morning with a sense of disbelief she's gone. Every night I wake up and play over and over in my head: 'If only I'd done this…'
Carolyn adds: ""We don't want any other athletes to go through this. Short of getting Kelly back, we just want to get the right programme to help folk before it's too late.
""I just wish she was still here.""

business	Ukraine war: World Bank boss warns over global recession	"f the World Bank has warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could cause a global recession as the price of food, energy and fertiliser jump.
David Malpass told a US business event on Wednesday that it is difficult to ""see how we avoid a recession"".
He also said that a series of coronavirus lockdowns in China is adding to concerns about a slowdown.
His comments are the latest warning over the rising risk that the world economy may be set to contract.
""As we look at the global GDP... it's hard right now to see how we avoid a recession,"" Mr Malpass said, without giving a specific forecast.
""The idea of energy prices doubling is enough to trigger a recession by itself,"" he added.
Last month, the World Bank cut its global economic growth forecast for this year by almost a full percentage point, to 3.2%.
GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, measures the size of an economy. Gauging its expansion or contraction is one of the most important ways of measuring how well or badly an economy is performing and is closely watched by economists and central banks.
It helps businesses to judge when to expand and recruit more workers or invest less and cut their workforces. 
Governments also use it to guide decisions on everything from tax to spending. It is a key gauge, along with inflation, for central banks when considering whether or not to raise or lower interest rates.
Mr Malpass also said that many European countries were still too dependent on Russia for oil and gas.
's even as Western nations push ahead with plans to reduce their dependence on Russian energy.
He also told a virtual event organised by the US Chamber of Commerce that moves by Russia to cut gas supplies could cause a ""substantial slowdown"" in the region.
He said higher energy prices were already weighing on Germany, which is the biggest economy in Europe and the fourth largest in the world.
Developing countries are also being affected by shortages of fertiliser, food and energy, Mr Malpass said.
Mr Malpass also raised concerns about lockdowns in some of China's major cities - including the financial, manufacturing and shipping hub of Shanghai - which he said are ""still having ramifications or slowdown impacts on the world"".
""China was already going through some contraction of real estate, so the forecast of China's growth before Russia's invasion had already softened substantially for 2022,"" he said.
""Then the waves of Covid caused lockdowns which further reduced growth expectations for China,"" he added.
Also on Wednesday, China's premier Li Keqiang said the world's second largest economy had been hit harder by the latest round of lockdowns than it had been at the start of the pandemic in 2020.
He also called for more action by officials to restart factories after lockdowns.
""Progress is not satisfactory,"" Mr Li said. ""Some provinces are reporting that only 30% of businesses have reopened… the ratio must be raised to 80% within a short period of time.""
Full or partial lockdowns were imposed in dozens of Chinese cities in March and April, including a long shutdown of Shanghai.
measures have led to a sharp slowdown in economic activity across the country.
In recent weeks, official figures have shown that large parts of economy have been impacted, from manufacturers to retailers.

health	Strep A death of eighth child confirmed	"An eighth child has died from a severe strep A bacterial infection, it has been confirmed.
Morelands Primary, in Waterlooville, Hampshire, said it was ""absolutely devastated"" by the loss of one of its pupils.
Such deaths are rare, but, since September, seven other UK children have lost their lives due to complications of the disease.
Earlier, it emerged a 12-year-old pupil in south-east London had also died.
And there have been five deaths of under-fives in England and a death of a seven-year-old in Wales.
Reports say there are eight cases of severe strep disease in Scotland, but no deaths. It is not known whether there are any ongoing severe cases in Wales and Northern Ireland.
However, a cluster of scarlet fever cases has been identified at a primary school in County Down. Some people who have Strep A develop scarlet fever, which causes a skin rash (that feels like sandpaper) and flu-like symptoms, including a high temperature.
Morelands Primary School head teacher Alison Syred-Paul said: ""We are absolutely devastated by the loss of one of our young pupils and offer our sincere and heartfelt condolences to the child's family at this extremely sad time. We ask that the privacy of the family is respected. 
""As a precaution, we have been raising awareness amongst parents, carers and our school community of the signs and symptoms...and what to do if a child develops these.""
Richard Russell, head of Colfe's School in Lee, London, where the 12-year-old Year 8 pupil died, said the tragedy was ""wholly unexpected"" and had affected ""all members of the school community"".
He said the school was doing what it could to support the pupil's family ""who are seeking to come to terms with their devastating loss"".
Health experts say parents and doctors need to be vigilant and have a low bar for treating the contagious disease that is circulating earlier than usual this year. 
UK must brace itself for more cases, as levels of the bacteria circulating are thought currently to be high.
Most strep A infections are mild and get better with antibiotics. But some people who catch it can get very sick.
Four-year-old Camila Rose Burns is critically ill and on a ventilator in hospital because of a severe strep A infection, known as invasive group A Strep (iGAS). 
Her father, Dean Burns, from Liverpool, told the BBC's Today programme: ""She is still fighting for her life. She is really poorly, it is just devastating to us as a family. We can't believe this has happened.
""It progressed to something called invasive group A strep, which has now gone into her bloodstream and has devastated her body.
""I'm at a loss with it all, I just want our family back. The pain is unimaginable. She is just so beautiful and precious. She is just our special little girl.""
UK Health Security Agency's (UKHSA) chief medical adviser, Dr Susan Hopkins, said: ""We are concerned, and concerned enough to ensure that we wanted to make the public aware of the signs and symptoms that they should watch out for and of course to alert clinicians to prescribe antibiotics for these conditions.""
She says an early start to the strep A infections season in the UK could be a side effect of the easing of pandemic restrictions. 
""We are back to normal social mixing and the patterns of diseases that we are seeing at the moment are out of sync with the normal seasons, as people mix back to normal and move around and pass infections on.""
Strep A can cause a range of illnesses. Most cases are mild - a sore throat or a skin infection that can be easily treated with antibiotics.
Some people develop scarlet fever, which causes a skin rash (that feels like sandpaper) and flu-like symptoms, including a high temperature. 
Very rarely, strep A can cause something called invasive group A streptococcal infection or iGAS, which can be deadly. 
Invasive disease happens when the bacteria get past your body's immune defences.
Warning signs of invasive disease include:
Urgent, early medical help is essential.
UKHSA advises that anyone with a high fever, severe muscle aches, pain in one area of the body and unexplained vomiting or diarrhoea should call NHS 111 and seek medical help immediately.
Strep A can be treated with antibiotics.
Prof Jim McManus, current president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, said the UK should expect more cases: ""It is a function of numbers. There are many more cases of group A strep around, and because there are many more cases, the number of severe cases will rise.
""We had four deaths in 2017-18,"" he added, comparing that figure to this year's total.
""It is a case for real vigilance. We seem to have forgotten that strep A is around, so we have to think strep A when children present with symptoms that could be Strep A. In some cases perhaps we had thought this had gone away because we had been thinking about other infections.""
As a parent, if you feel that your child seems seriously unwell, you should trust your own judgement. Contact NHS 111 or your GP if:

technology	New FTX boss condemns crypto exchange's failure	"New FTX chief executive John Ray has hit out at the way the failed crypto exchange was run.
firm filed for bankruptcy in the US last week and, in court filings, Mr Ray said he had never ""seen such a complete failure of corporate controls"". 
Mr Ray, who replaced Sam Bankman-Fried, also criticised a ""complete absence of trustworthy financial information"".
Meanwhile, Mr Bankman-Fried has told the Vox news website that he regretted filing for bankruptcy.
He said that the decision had largely taken financial matters out of his control, and he also expressed his disdain for financial regulators.
Mr Ray said what he had found since taking over was ""unprecedented"" in his 40-year career, which includes overseeing the bankruptcy of US energy giant Enron.
In documents filed for the first day of bankruptcy proceedings at the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Mr Ray also criticised what he said were ""erratic and misleading"" public statements by his predecessor. 
Mr Ray said that FTX had concentrated control in the hands of a ""very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals"", and that it did not maintain centralised control of its cash.  
Instead, he said, there was an ""absence of an accurate list of bank accounts and account signatories"".
So far he said it had been possible to locate ""only a fraction of the digital assets"" held by the firm. 
Mr Ray's declaration to the court also says: ""In the Bahamas, I understand that corporate funds of the FTX Group were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees and advisors.""
w chief executive did add that there was ""a core team of dedicated employees"" who had stayed focused on their jobs since the bankruptcy.
He also noted some of the people most hurt by these events ""are current and former employees and executives, whose personal investments and reputations have suffered"".
FTX is estimated to owe  money to more than a million people and organisations.
It is unclear how much those with funds in the exchange will get back at the end of bankruptcy proceedings, though many experts warn it may be a small fraction of what they put into the firm.

entertainment	Joe Lycett did not shred £10k in David Beckham Qatar protest	"Comedian Joe Lycett has revealed he did not really shred £10,000 during a protest against David Beckham's role as an ambassador for the Qatar World Cup.
Lycett livestreamed himself apparently destroying the cash on Sunday after the ex-England footballer did not respond to his ultimatum to drop the job in support of LGBT people.
On Monday, Lycett confirmed he had in fact donated the money to charity.
He said destroying the cash would have been ""irresponsible"".
Some LGBT fans have boycotted the Fifa Men's World Cup over Qatar's treatment of gay people, as same-sex relationships are criminalised in the country.
In a video update posted on Twitter, Lycett explained: ""The truth is, the money that went into the shredder was real, but the money that came out was fake.
""In fact, the 10 grand had already been donated to LGBTQ+ charities before I even pressed send on the initial tweet last week.""
""I would never destroy real money,"" he told his followers, ""I would never be so irresponsible."" 
Addressing Beckham directly, he added: ""I never expected to hear from you - it was an empty threat designed to get people talking.
""In many ways, it was like your deal with Qatar, David - total [rubbish] from the start.""
In the previous video, Lycett described Beckham as a ""gay icon"" but warned that this status was now under threat. 
Birmingham-born comic ended his latest update by actually shredding a copy of Beckham's Attitude front cover, saying he had been given the blessing of the magazine, which was the first gay publication to shoot a Premier League star.
Warning: Lycett's video reveal contains some strong language.
ublicity stunt, which took place on the same day the controversial World Cup began, initially received a mixed reaction.
Some defended Lycett, arguing that he had succeeded in gaining more than £10,000 worth of valuable publicity for the LGBT cause; while others suggested he should have instead donated the money to charity, which it now transpires he has done.
rtainer shared a video of the apparent shredding on social media alongside the caption ""a platform for progress"", using a phrase Beckham himself had used in a promotional campaign about the tournament in the Middle East.

In the clip, Lycett was seen placing wads of what appeared to be cash into an industrial shredder while wearing a rainbow tulle outfit, but it was not clear whether the banknotes were genuine.
He set the former England captain a deadline of midday on 20 November to take action after it was reported he had signed a £10m deal with the Fifa World Cup hosts.
median said he would donate £10,000 of his own money to LGBT charities if Beckham ended the sponsorship deal before the tournament started.
Beckham has not publicly commented on Lycett's stunt.
World Cup has been shrouded in controversy due to issues around LGBT rights in Qatar, along with the host nation's treatment of migrant workers.
It continued on Monday as it was confirmed that England, Wales and other European nations will not wear the OneLove armband at the World Cup because of the threat of players being booked.
, including England's Harry Kane and Gareth Bale of Wales, had planned to wear the armband during matches to promote diversity and inclusion.
A joint statement from seven football associations said they could not put their players ""in a position where they could face sporting sanctions"".

sports	Shaun Murphy: Ex-world champion opens up on reasons for 'life-changing' stomach surgery	"Shaun Murphy says reaching ""the bottom of my mental health"" convinced him to brave ""life-changing"" stomach surgery.
Former World, UK and Masters champion Murphy, 40, had a gastric sleeve operation during the summer.
rocedure involves removing a large part of the stomach, limiting the ability to consume excessive amounts.
""I just wish I had done it 20 years ago, because it does feel as if it's changed my life for the better,"" Murphy told BBC Sport's Framed podcast.
""I've struggled with my weight all my life. I was the fat kid in school, I feel like I've been dieting ever since I was 15, probably younger, and I just reached the end of my tether with it.
""I'd reached the bottom of my mental health, I was on the ground. I was very close to going to the doctor about depression, anxiety, not being able to go out, because I was getting shouted at in the street.
""On social media people were sending me horrific messages and comments and direct messages on Instagram and Twitter.
""And in the end I just thought, I need to do something about this, this is going to be the end of me, mentally and possibly physically.""
Murphy, one of only 11 players to claim snooker's illustrious 'Triple Crown' of World, UK and Masters titles, says he has shed four stone in the three and a half months since surgery.
""I can now eat whatever I want, but I can literally eat very, very little of it,"" he explained in his podcast chat with BBC Sport presenter Shabnam Younus-Jewell.
""I couldn't tell you the last time I finished a coffee as I can't physically take that much liquid in one go - if I sit there with a pint of Guinness, I'll still be sipping away at my first pint while everyone else is on their third.
""So I can still do all the same things. But whereas I would have eaten the whole packet of biscuits before and then been looking for a packet of crisps, that's me done.""
Essex-born potter, who was raised in Northamptonshire, says he elected for the drastic option of surgery after feeling like he had exhausted all other weight loss avenues.
""I've lost weight, gained weight pretty much consistently for the last 20 years and I've tried every diet going,"" Murphy added.
""I've tried being very cautious and careful in calorie counting, I've been to various clubs and saw success with those methods. 
""It was just always the maintenance of keeping weight off that I struggled with. When you're away on tour you're eating late, you're often eating rubbish, and I've just been unable to discipline myself.
""I just ran out of patience with it. At the World Championships this year I'd ballooned to nearly 20 stone, so I just knew I had to do something about it. 
""There are three or four types [of gastric surgery] - I wanted the most extreme one, the one that is irreversible. Because my stomach's now so small, it's highly unlikely I'll ever be able to physically consume enough calories in one go to put the weight back on.""
While he elected to have surgery for health reasons, Murphy, nicknamed the 'Magician', hopes his disappearing waistline can also help conjure up renewed success on the table.
Murphy has won nine ranking titles in his career - including the 2005 World Championship, where he burst on to the scene as a qualifier - but his most recent triumph was back in 2020 at the Welsh Open.
He did reach the 2021 Crucible final, losing to Mark Selby but, after being a top-10 mainstay for more than 15 years, is in danger of dropping out of the all-important world's top 16.
""An added bonus to that [the surgery] is that it is going to have a knock-on effect on all aspects of my life, including my career,"" Murphy added.
""From the basic point of being able to bend over the table better, being able to get lower to the shot. If you're carrying any extra weight that becomes quite difficult. 
""The Crucible this year was a classic example. It's quite a funny clip actually, in my match against Stephen Maguire, and I fouled the ball with my cufflink. But that was because I couldn't reach over the table.
""If you're backstage, listening to the MC waiting to be introduced and your shirt doesn't fit, your waistcoat and trousers are too tight, it just puts you in completely the wrong mindset.""
John Higgins and Mark Allen are among the players whose games have benefitted from weight loss in recent times and Murphy hopes the same will apply to him.
""Really the only target I've yet to achieve is getting to the top of the rankings, I've never been able to say I'm world number one,"" he added.
""I've got a pretty clean slate in terms of rankings for the next few seasons and if I can get my act together and start putting some balls in pockets again, I could start climbing the ladder."""	/sport/snooker/63373974

health	Nurses in Scotland to strike after rejecting pay deal from NHS	"Nurses in Scotland are set to strike after voting down the latest pay offer for NHS workers. 
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) Scotland members rejected an average increase of 7.5%. The union said it was planning for industrial action and would announce dates early next year. 
Royal College of Midwives (RCM) members also rejected the pay deal. 
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said he was disappointed but would continue negotiations with unions.
In the RCN ballot that closed on Monday, 82% voted against the offer. 
union, which has more than 30,000 NHS members in Scotland, had asked for an increase of at least 5% above inflation - which is currently 10.7%.
Julie Lamberth, RCN Scotland board chair, said nurses had ""forcefully rejected"" the deal.
She added: ""Make no mistake - we do not want to go on strike. Years of being undervalued and understaffed have left us feeling we have been left with no option because enough is enough. 
""The ball is in Scottish government's court if strike action is going to be avoided.""
Last month, ministers tabled an improved pay offer averaging 7.5% to health workers threatening industrial action.
Annual salary rises under the proposal would range from a flat rate payment of £2,205 for staff in Bands 1 to 4 and up to £2,660 for staff in Bands 5 to 7, backdated to April.  
represents an increase of 11.3% for the lowest paid workers and delivers an average uplift of 7.5%.
Unite and Unison chose to accept the deal, however, the GMB union became the first to reject it last week.
was also rejected by 65% of midwives who voted in the RCM ballot. The union, which has about 3,000 members in Scotland, said it was considering industrial action. 
Jaki Lambert, RCM director for Scotland, said: ""Our members have spoken loud and clear - the latest pay offer by the Scottish government is simply not good enough. It goes nowhere near addressing the rising cost of living and would see many midwives actually worse off in real terms.
""Our members have been consistent throughout this process - they want a decent deal, and they are prepared to take industrial action to get one. 
""No midwife wants to do this and it is for the Scottish government to make sure that they do not feel that they are left with no other option.""
rejection of this pay offer by such a high proportion of RCN members will be a real blow for the Scottish government, which had billed it as the best and highest offer in the UK.  
It will also be disappointing for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon after she had personally intervened, meeting nursing leaders to see if there was anything that could be done to get this deal over the line.
It now leaves a complicated picture here in Scotland because some other unions, including Unison, who also represent some of the nursing workforce, have accepted the offer. Others like GMB, who represent ambulance staff, have turned it down.
I'm told there is a willingness on all sides to get back round the table and see if any more can be done, but it is hard to see where such negotiations can go.
Strikes in the new year are still not inevitable, but it they are growing ever more likely. 
Humza Yousaf said the government had made its ""best and final pay offer"" to NHS staff.
retary said: ""While I am naturally disappointed the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal College of Nursing have rejected this offer, I respect the voice of their membership. 
""We have engaged tirelessly with trade union representatives over recent weeks and months, leaving no stone unturned to reach a record pay offer which responds to the key concerns of staff across the service.""
minister said he would be meeting with trade unions on Thursday to continue ""meaningful dialogue"".
He added: ""We are making this offer at a time of extraordinary financial challenges to the Scottish government to get money into the pockets of hard working staff and to avoid industrial action, in what is already going to be an incredibly challenging winter.
""Constructive engagement is crucial, those unions who have rejected our pay offer have all said they want to avoid industrial action, we must collectively work toward avoiding strikes taking place this winter at a time of already significant pressure for our NHS.""
Scottish Conservative health spokesperson, Dr Sandesh Gulhane, called on Mr Yousaf to ""immediately get back round the table"" with the RCN to prevent strike action going ahead.
He said: ""Scotland's NHS is on its knees due to the health secretary's mismanagement, so the last thing it can afford going into the peak winter period is industrial action.""
Scottish Labour health spokesperson Jackie Baillie said the health secretary should step down. 
She said: ""Under the SNP, Scotland's heroic nursing staff have been pushed to breaking point. We are already in the midst of a full-blown winter crisis, with lives being risked on a daily basis.
""It's time that Humza Yousaf does the right thing and resigns."" 
And Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said: ""Nurses have gone above and beyond in recent years to keep all of us safe. They need a proper pay deal, better working conditions and safe staffing levels.

entertainment	BTS: K-pop stars to take time out for military service	"world's biggest boy band BTS will be abandoning their fandom ""army"" to join the South Korean military for national service, their agents say.
firmation ends years of debate over whether the K-pop stars might be exempted from military duties.
In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18-28 must serve about two years.
BTS members had been allowed to put off starting their military service until they turned 30. The oldest, Jin, is currently 29.
He will begin preparations next month, the band's management revealed on Monday. All seven members of the group - the youngest of whom is 25 - also plan on following through with their service, it said.
South Korea retains compulsory military service mainly because the country is still technically at war with its nuclear-armed neighbour, North Korea.
reviously won a deferral - when in 2020, South Korea's parliament passed a bill allowing the biggest K-pop stars to delay their duties until the age of 30.
uncement by BTS comes just months after the band announced they would be taking a break, with some members pursuing individual projects.
K-pop group have been the world's best-selling artists for the past two years -  known for catchy, upbeat hits like Dynamite and Butter. They've also been praised for their advocacy on young people's mental health.
Viewed by many South Koreans as national treasures -  some lawmakers had suggested the band could be granted an exemption so they could keep performing. Such exemptions have been given to Olympic medallists and other high-achieving sports stars, classical musicians and dancers.
However, the statement from the band's managers on Monday said the musicians were content to carry out their duties. Jin - who had originally applied for his service start date to be delayed - had cancelled that request, their agency said.
uncement suggests the band would probably not get back together for at least a couple of years. 
""Both the company and the members of BTS are looking forward to reconvening as a group again around 2025 following their service commitment,"" said their management company in a statement.
South Korea's defence minister, in discussing the band's prospects in August, had suggested the group could still perform while being enlisted.
""There would be a way to give them a chance to practice and perform together,"" said Lee Jong-sup."	/news/world-asia-63282589

firm says the production halt will come into effect on Monday and stay in place until of end of next week.
It is the latest big car maker to announce that it is being impacted by the Covid-19 measures in China.
Meanwhile, Tesla has reportedly halted most production at its Shanghai plant due to problems with sourcing parts.
""Due to the impact of the semiconductor shortage, we announced our revised production plan for May,"" Toyota said in a statement.
""However, as a result of the lockdown in Shanghai, China, we have decided to additionally suspend operations of 14 lines at 8 plants in Japan from May 16 (Mon) to May 21 (Sat),"" it added.
mpany previously said it planned to produce around 750,000 vehicles globally this month but said it had now cut that forecast by about 50,000 due to the lockdown.
Also on Wednesday, Toyota revealed that its quarterly profit had slumped by a third as it felt the impact of production disruptions caused by a global shortage of computer chips and China's Covid-19 restrictions.
world's biggest car maker by sales posted an operating profit of 463.8 billion yen ($3.56bn; £2.9bn) for the three months to the end of March, well below market expectations.
mpany's shares were around 4.5% lower in Wednesday afternoon trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
's announcements came as Shanghai is in its sixth week of an intensifying lockdown that has made it increasingly difficult for manufacturers to operate amid tough restrictions on the movement of people and materials.
It is the latest example of a major car maker being forced to cut back production as a result of the lockdown in Shanghai.

technology	Astronomer in Twitter limbo over 'intimate' meteor	"An astronomer from Oxfordshire was locked out of her Twitter account for three months after sharing a video of a meteor which was flagged by the site's automated moderation tools.
Mary McIntyre was told that her six-second animated clip featured ""intimate content"", shared without the consent of the participant.
Her only option was to delete the tweet.
However, in doing so she would have had to agree that she had broken the rules.
Her initial 12-hour ban went on for three months - and she exhausted the online appeals process.
""It's just crazy... I  don't really want it on my record that I've been sharing pornographic material when I haven't,"" she said of her refusal to delete the tweet.
Her account was still visible, but Ms McIntyre couldn't access it. 
Following the BBC publishing this article, it has now been restored.
Since Twitter was purchased by Elon Musk, thousands of staff have either been laid off or have left their jobs, but even before that Ms McIntyre found it impossible to talk to anyone about it inside the firm.
""If I wasn't getting a human response before [Musk took over], I think I've got zero probability of getting one now,"" she said at the time.
Yoel Roth, Twitter's then head of trust and integrity, had tweeted that the firm's layoffs did not affect ""most"" of the 2,000 content moderators working ""on front-line review"". Mr Roth has himself since left.
BBC tweeted Twitter's support account and contacted Mr Musk via SpaceX because Twitter currently has no communications department. There has been no response.
Ms McIntyre said other astronomers had shared the video on her behalf without consequences. 
She was worried that if she agreed to Twitter's rules of re-instatement, her non-existent misdemeanour might be flagged up, as she has regular checks in order to work with school-aged children, explaining astronomy.
""I miss the interaction,"" she said of her locked account. ""I feel a bit cut off from the astronomy world.""
US meteorologist Ryan Vaughan faced a similar ban after sharing a video of combine harvesters working in a field at night. This too was flagged as an intimate moment.
Mr Vaughan eventually did choose to delete the tweet and falsely accept that he had broken Twitter's community rules, because he wanted his account back.
""It's not fair and it's wrong,"" he tweeted. ""This needs to be fixed.""
re are also reports of Twitter accounts being wrongly flagged as belonging to children aged below 13 and blocked - including one belonging to a charity for the families of people held hostage, and another of a BBC journalist.
mmentator Kate Bevan said it was an example of the limitations of the current artificial intelligence tools used by Twitter and other social networks to carry out moderation tasks.
""AI tools are OK for quick and dirty decisions, but it shows that content moderation at scale is really difficult - both for humans and for the AI tools that are supporting them,"" she said. 
""It's even worse when there are no humans available to review bad AI decisions. Apart from the unfairness, it means the AI model isn't getting feedback, so it will never learn to improve.""
It is not a problem that is unique to Twitter: in 2021 the owner of a small digital photo gallery had pictures of wildlife, landscapes and buildings blocked by Facebook, on the grounds that they contained ""overtly sexual"" content.

business	California says Amazon's dominance drives up online prices	"f California has accused Amazon of violating competition law with practices that prevent sellers from offering lower prices elsewhere.
wsuit from America's most populous state says the moves have hurt rivals and made online shopping more expensive for everyone.
It marks the biggest legal threat Amazon has faced in the US. 
But a similar lawsuit was dismissed in the US earlier this year for insufficient evidence of higher prices.
Proving harm to consumers in the form of higher prices is a key issue in US competition law. 
Amazon said that like the DC case, California's complaint had it ""exactly backwards"" and that the lawsuit should be dismissed.
""Sellers set their own prices for the products they offer in our store,"" the company said. ""Amazon takes pride in the fact that we offer low prices across the broadest selection, and like any store we reserve the right not to highlight offers to customers that are not priced competitively.""
In the complaint, California says Amazon's contracts require sellers to offer the lowest price on Amazon, restraining the ability of other websites to compete. 
By protecting Amazon's dominance of the market, the deals give the firm freedom to raise fees on merchants, which eventually hit consumers in the form of higher prices.
""Amazon knows its price parity agreements prevent rivals from stealing market share away with lower prices reflective of their lower fees. So Amazon keeps raising fees, leading to higher prices on Amazon, leading to higher prices off Amazon due to price parity,"" the lawsuit says.
It said this created ""a vicious anticompetitive cycle in which Amazon wins and its third-party sellers, its wholesale suppliers, consumers, and competition lose"".
wsuit also accuses Amazon of punishing merchants who run afoul of the rules, with tactics such as moving their listings lower in search results,
""The reality is: Many of the products we buy online would be cheaper if market forces were left unconstrained,"" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement announcing the lawsuit.
ugh the lawsuit is limited to California, its effect could be far-reaching given California's size. 
wsuit comes as regulators, especially in the European Union, increasingly question the dominance of a handful tech giants.
ummer Amazon sought to settle a case brought by the EU which accused it of using data it collects on sellers to compete against them. 
Amazon is also under investigation in the UK over concerns that the company is giving an unfair advantage to certain sellers on its marketplace.
Meanwhile an EU court this week also largely upheld a record fine against Google for using the Android platform to cement its search engine's dominance."	/news/business-62908412

Western Health and Social Care Trust has not said when it expects emergency general surgery to resume.
Its chief executive officer, Neil Guckian, said that ""patients will be safer with these changes"".
But some people in County Fermanagh did not seem convinced about Thursday's announcement. 
""The trust don't understand what it's like to have a rural hospital - travel is not acceptable,"" Dermot Browne told BBC News NI.
""We fought hard to get this hospital here in the first place.""
Mr Browne added that ""the direction of travel has been concerning for people here"".
""If there is an issue with staff that needs to be resolved with services reinstated as soon as possible.""
Despite saying the move was temporary, the trust did not say when it expected emergency general surgery would resume.
mergency department and other services including obstetrics will continue to operate as normal.
Other - mostly lower grade - surgeons will remain on site at the County Fermanagh hospital.
rust said this was necessary to protect the public's safety after it had problems recruiting surgical staff.
Protesters gathered outside the town hall in objection to the announcement.
Representatives from the trust held a meeting with local community and council representatives in Enniskillen Town Hall on Thursday evening.
At it, Mr Guckian said that regardless of what had been reported in the media, he was ""proud of the engagement between the trust and the council"".
He said the trust was dealing with a very difficult situation in regard to emergency surgery and was ""working our way through this"".
He paid tribute to all surgeons at SWAH for maintaining services over the years in challenging circumstances. 
However, Reggie Ferguson, chairman from Save Our Acute Services (SOAS), told the meeting it was his organisation's belief that the trust had been deliberately running down services in preparation for the announcement.
""This has been on the cards for a long time,"" he said.
""Your communication is terrible, everything seems to be behind the scenes.""
Referring to the region's poor infrastructure in the context of proposals to transport some patients to other hospitals, Mr Ferguson added: ""The road to Altnagelvin would make you sick if you weren't sick already."" 
UUP councillor Diane Armstrong said it was ""a dark day that affects everybody, man, woman and child"".
Ms Armstrong said the people of Fermanagh and south Tyrone ""feel marginalised by this decision"", and she was personally ""absolutely disgusted"".
No one likes change -  especially if it affects your local health service.  
But according to Raphael Bengoa - and several other health experts who've penned health reviews - change is necessary if Northern Ireland's health system is to be sustainable. 
People in Enniskillen say they are the latest ""casualties"" in plans to change how services are delivered across the region. 
Western Trust argues that change is necessary as the service is no longer safe. 
Whatever the argument, local people say it feels like this is being thrust on them as a last resort.  
me what should have taken place was much needed dialogue, explanation and local people being properly informed about how the proposed changes will affect them.
Instead, they say, a vacuum was created which encouraged rumour and misinformation that SWAH was set to remove all its emergency services. 
While making any sort of change to the Northern Ireland health and social care system can be politicised and emotive - not having those conversations in advance can often be even more problematic. 
Diane McCaffery, who attended with her husband Eunan, is a retired emergency care manager from the cardio assessment unit at SWAH.
She said she had seen first hand how emergency surgery saved lives and thought this decision to reduce surgical services was ""catastrophic"".
Carmel Tracey and her daughter Emily said they ""know the implications"" of the announcement.
""Having to be transferred could put your life at risk. We deserve better,"" said added Ms Tracey.
Sinn Féin MP Michelle Gildernew challenged the trust to set out clearly their plan for the restoration of emergency surgical services.
""The people of Fermanagh (and South Tyrone) need clarity from the trust on the steps they have taken to date, but most importantly, the actions they will now take, to ensure emergency surgical services at SWAH are urgently restored. 
""Vague assurances will not do.""
Earlier in the day, DUP MLA Deborah Erskine said she understood the concerns of constituents but felt there was good news for the hospital's future with the announcement that it is to become a new centre for planned surgery.
""The pressures with surgeons date back to 2018 in the Western Trust,"" she said.
""We need to have a system, we need to have a way forward in which we ensure services are safe for both the workplace in the SWAH and also for our patients."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63644073

ude a conversation between the former prime minister and Prince Charles, as he was then, about the Queen abdicating.
Sir John's office told the newspaper there was never any such discussion.
""Sir John has not co-operated in any way with The Crown. Nor has he ever been approached by them to fact-check any script material in this or any other series,"" a statement from his office read.
""As you will know, discussions between the monarch and prime minister are entirely private and - for Sir John - will always remain so. But not one of the scenes you depict are accurate in any way whatsoever. They are fiction, pure and simple.""
However, a spokeswoman for The Crown defended the show, saying: ""The Crown has always been presented as a drama based on historical events.
""Series five is a fictional dramatisation, imagining what could have happened behind closed doors during a significant decade for the royal family - one that has already been scrutinised and well-documented by journalists, biographers and historians.""
will focus on the tumultuous early 1990s, which saw Prince Charles and Princess Diana separate.
Sir Malcom Rifkind, foreign secretary under Sir John, also criticised the popular drama, telling The Mail on Sunday that the scene featuring Sir John and Prince Charles was ""pathetic and absurd"", while broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby, a friend of the King, said: ""The Crown is full of nonsense, but this is nonsense on stilts.""
w series is released on Netflix on 9 November and is expected to show Prince Charles (played by Dominic West) cutting short a holiday with Diana, Princess of Wales to host a secret meeting with Sir John (Jonny Lee Miller), at his private residence, Highgrove, in 1991.
Imelda Staunton comes on board as the latest actress to play the late Queen, following in the footsteps of Claire Foy and Olivia Colman.
Some figures have defended The Crown's fictional interpretation of events.
According to The Times, Robert Harris, the historical fiction author and former journalist, said: ""I take a kind of heretical view in that I think The Crown has done the royal family nothing but good in some ways.""
Speaking at the Cliveden Literary Festival, he added: ""Nobody really takes it literally, do they? I'm not sure that they do.""
Prince Harry has also said it gave a rough idea of what living as a Royal was like.
He told James Corden in an interview last year: ""They [The Crown] don't pretend to be news. It's fictional. But it's loosely based on the truth. Of course, it's not strictly accurate, of course not, but loosely it gives you a rough idea about what that lifestyle, the pressures of putting duty and service above family and everything else, what can come from that.""
Netflix has previously stated that it will not warn viewers of The Crown that some scenes are fictional.
Responding to calls for a warning from the then Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden in 2020, the streaming giant said the series has always been billed as a drama.
""As a result we have no plans, and see no need, to add a disclaimer,"" it said.
However, a tagline on the Netflix show's home page reads: ""Based on historical events, this series dramatises the story of Queen Elizabeth II and the political and personal events that have shaped her reign.""
Mr Dowden said younger viewers ""may mistake fiction for fact"" when watching the fourth series, which showed the breakdown of the marriage between the then Prince and Princess of Wales.
Filming on the sixth series of The Crown was briefly suspended as a mark of respect after the Queen's death. It was also halted on the day of her funeral.
But there was consternation from some quarters about the fifth series being released two months after Her Majesty's death.
Loose Women presenter Brenda Edwards were among the figures suggesting it should have been delayed as a mark of respect."	/news/entertainment-arts-63283024
business	The supermarket rows you don't usually hear about	"Rows between big brands and supermarkets normally remain behind closed doors, but now one has dramatically burst into the open. 
Britain's biggest retailer Tesco is at loggerheads with Kraft Heinz, one of the world's largest food manufacturers. 
It's led to some of the country's favourite products such as Heinz ketchup and baked beans disappearing from Tesco's shelves. 
Kraft Heinz has hit the pause button on deliveries in a disagreement over how much Tesco is prepared to pay for its products. 
It's an illustration of the challenges facing suppliers and supermarkets as they grapple with huge cost increases. 
But who should bear the pain of absorbing soaring raw material costs, energy price rises, and higher fuel bills for deliveries? 
Price negotiations are happening across retail. They've been going on for many months. 
""Suppliers are now saying: 'This is what I can afford to sell this product to you for. And if you don't agree I am going to stop supplying you,'"" says Ged Futter, founder of The Retail Mind.  
He knows more than most how fierce these discussions are. Mr Futter is a former buyer for Asda and now advises suppliers on how to negotiate with retailers. 
""I've got a client who's having conversations as we speak with a retailer about a price that's needed, and that needs to be agreed tomorrow and if they don't agree it tonight the trucks will stop. 
""I've never seen as many suppliers prepared to stop the trucks and I've got examples from every single retailer, except Aldi, of clients having to stop the trucks."" 
Supermarkets have buyers who agree deals with suppliers to provide them with products. For many items, like olive oil and tinned tomatoes, it can be an annual contract. 
Both sides are allowed, under the Groceries Supply Code of Practice, to adjust terms and conditions. The editor-in-chief of the Grocer magazine, Adam Leyland, says in the past retailers typically demanded changes but now it is suppliers who are clamouring to renegotiate what they are getting paid.
""Suppliers are saying we need change and we need it quickly. Supermarkets have been dragging their feet for a long time. This has been building from last year and the dial has now turned up. 
""It's fraught on both sides. This is not an easy time.""
re food supply chain is facing a once-in-a-generation style rise in costs. According to the Office for National Statistics, the rate of inflation for manufacturers has now hit 22%. 
So how do these negotiations work? 
Ged Futter says suppliers are often asked to fill out a cost justification sheet to help retailers determine whether price increases are merited. 
Everything that goes into making a product is broken down and scrutinised line by line. 
""Take cardboard. The supplier might say, 'Ours has gone up by 40%.' But the retailer might say, 'Well our costs have only gone up by 20%, so I'm not giving you 40%, I'm giving you 20%,'"" he says. 
And he claims some supermarkets use delaying tactics to put off an increase for as long as possible. 
""If a cost price increase is going to go live in 12 weeks' time, for example, what you'll probably get from quite a few retailers is radio silence for eleven and a half weeks.""
Supermarkets, with thin profit margins, are under pressure as well. 
re's a battle in the aisles to keep prices as low as possible on the most popular products for customers. 
Buying teams are being hit by demands from hundreds of suppliers all at the same time. And they want to make sure any cost increase is justified. 
""There's always an element of suppliers adding on a bit,"" says one supermarket source. 
Some of the costs are being absorbed and some are being passed on to shoppers. Food price inflation is currently running at around 8%. 
Ged Futter says some of his clients are now in their fourth or fifth wave of cost price increases. 
So who blinks first in the spat between Tesco and Kraft Heinz? 
uble the size of its nearest rival and has huge clout. Kraft Heinz is a global giant and one of the few big manufacturers with the power to stand its ground. 
And, unusually, they've both issued public comments on the matter.
't prepared to pass on ""unjustifiable price increases"" to its customers. Heinz says its commodity and production costs are rising and it isn't prepared to compromise on quality. 
rly wants to be seen as a consumer champion as the cost of living crisis starts to bite. 
Adam Leyland thinks the supermarket is sending a broader message to its big suppliers as well. 
""I think they want suppliers to know that they're not going to roll over and accept everything that's pushed through,"" he says.
With hundreds of thousands of Heinz products sold every week, Tesco cannot afford to have empty shelves for long. The danger is shoppers may go elsewhere for their Heinz baked beans, and potentially their entire weekly shop. 
Mr Leyland says it's a difficult balancing act to strike but that a deal will inevitably be done. 
""I think they will try to come to an elegant compromise."""	/news/business-62011145

politics	Climate change theme for first minister's Christmas card	"A drawing by a Glasgow schoolgirl which calls for action on climate change has been selected for the first minister's official Christmas card. 
Nine-year-old Evita Ye's design features a colourful snow globe and the words: ""The future is in our hands"". 
It reflects campaigning the children at Sunnyside Primary in Craigend have been doing on the climate crisis. 
Nicola Sturgeon unveiled the design at Sunnyside, where she met P5 pupil Evita to congratulate her. 
ren were tasked with creating a festive design that centres around the school's campaigning for climate action.
Sunnyside has created and run many successful climate campaigns and recently started the Running Out of Time relay.

technology	Gloucester Council planning site still disrupted from cyber attack	"A council's planning portal is still facing disruption after a cyber attack last year.
Gloucester City Council's services were hit on 20 December, after malware was sent to a council member by email.
At the time, the website's benefits, house sales and planning application sections were all affected.
Eight months on, Cllr Jeremy Hilton said the council needs to ""get its act together"". The council declined to comment on the latest issues.
Most of these issues have been fixed but the council is yet to restore its planning portal to how it was before the cyber attack.
It is currently not possible to view historic planning application details or submit comments through the online portal.
w current plans residents have to click on the relevant ward and find the application in a list. 
Liberal Democrat Cllr Hilton told the Local Democracy Reporting Service ""the planning portal must be fully restored as matter of urgency"".
He said: ""The public and councillors cannot read the written representations that have been sent in and they have to rely solely on the officer report, which is published a few days before the planning committee meets. This isn't good enough.""
Gloucester City Council's website says: ""It is not currently possible to view historic planning applications on our website and we are not able to email or post plans to customers.
""Please note that as a result of the cyber incident and the new processes we have put into place there may unfortunately be delays to our service.
""We are working hard to address these issues and will update our website as soon as we have more information.""
Gloucester City Council has not given a timeframe for when the issue will be resolved.

business	U-turns and Westminster turmoil 'cost me business'	"Political in-fighting and government U-turns have made customers cancel big orders, according to a family curtain-making business.
Mandy Jarman has been making curtains in Weston-super-Mare for 20 years, but has had more cancelled orders in the past few weeks than ever.
She said the political turmoil had made customers ""scared to spend money"".
A Somerset business group has found widespread cancellations hitting local firms after the changes in government.
Mandy said: ""It's the unnecessary luxury market, curtains, flowers, sofas, that is dying.""
Her elegant, quiet workroom seems a world away from Westminster.
She sits quietly at her sewing machine, or moves round large tables measuring out fabric for a big set of new curtains.
But the noise from SW1 has reached the seaside town where she has worked her whole life.
Five customers have cancelled orders. All face rising bills for gas, electricity and food. 
One couple decided they had to help their daughter pay her mortgage after interest rates rose sharply.
It is an example of how the policy decisions at Westminster ripple through this coastal town.
But a much bigger factor recently has been the constant changes of direction.
When Jeremy Hunt was brought in as the new chancellor, he reduced the government's help with household energy bills. 
Instead of capping prices for two years, the Energy Price Guarantee will only run until April. Then a new scheme will come in, targeted to help those he called ""the most vulnerable"".
World Bank has warned it is too expensive for governments to help everyone with their soaring energy bills and research suggests the UK's energy support scheme is far too expensive in its current form.
Politicians can argue the merits of the change, but in Mandy's showroom the immediate reaction was another cancelled order.
Mandy said: ""What's the point of saying we're going to do this to help you, and then three weeks later a new chancellor comes along and says 'sorry, we're not doing that any more'.
""People don't know what's going on, so they're holding on to their money now.""
Of course, it is not only curtains being cancelled.
In the middle of Weston, I meet John Mayer. He is a tax accountant who also runs the local Federation of Small Businesses.
He said he has been hearing the same complaint again and again.
""One thing businesses hate is uncertainty"", he said.
""And they've been through a lot recently, changes in prime minister, changes in chancellor, changes in policy.
""We just need some stable government now, and no more changes please.""
Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at King's College in London, said Brexit had also played a part in causing instability.
""The referendum has destabilised British politics,"" he said.
In the UK inflation is at a 40-year high of 10.1% and some retailers here have already had to shut up shop.
I first met Claire Morris back in the depths of Covid lockdowns. She had a small cafe in the middle of Weston, except it was closed like everyone else's in the pandemic.
She decided to change the business, offering the town its first zero-waste refill shop. 
Good and Proper Zero sold pasta and cereals, shampoos and laundry liquid. 
were all eco-products designed for people to bring their own containers and cut packaging waste.
As an entrepreneur she was not one to sit and wait for government help.
But when I popped into her shop, she told me she had decided to pack it in. 
Claire will close on Christmas Eve.
""To be honest it's a relief to have made the decision,"" she explained.
""The bills have just been mounting up.""
Her electricity bill has gone from £200 a month to £800 in the past 18 months. 
From December, she will lose the last bit of post-Covid help with business rates, and will have to pay the full rate.
""Energy and business taxes are just too high. It makes no sense to have a shop any more.""
Up the coast in Clevedon, North Somerset, Loraine Rogerson knows just what she means.
She started her local food store with her husband and daughter, showcasing the best meat, dairy, preserves and beers from North Somerset.
Even as people have tightened their belts and shopped more carefully, her customers have kept coming.
Iris Wheatley is in there buying some Somerset beef for dinner. ""It's a bit pricier, yes,"" she acknowledges, ""but it's so much better tasting"".
But Loraine is closing her shop down too. 
Why? Energy prices again.
""My electricity bill has gone from £600 a month to £1,200,"" she said.
""And that's with the government cap in place. What happens next year when it goes? I can't afford it.""
No further announcements have been made yet about The Energy Bills Relief Scheme that applies to businesses.
Like Claire Morris, Loraine Rogerson is a practical, energetic businesswoman. She will start something else.
But she says she can not plan what to do yet.
""We've got another new PM, we'll have yet another budget. We can't make any decisions until they do.""

business	Autumn Statement: Jeremy Hunt set to extend energy help but bills will go up	"Help with energy bills is likely to be extended beyond April but at a less generous level in Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's Autumn Statement.
Benefits and the state pensions will also rise with in line with prices, the BBC understands.
In his statement, at about 11.30 GMT, Mr Hunt will unveil tax rises and spending cuts aimed at mending the nation's finances.
Labour says working people are paying the price for 12 years of Tory failure.
But Mr Hunt will pledge to face into the economic ""storm"", claiming his plans will put the UK on a ""balanced path to stability"" as he tackles the ""enemy"" of inflation, which has soared to a 41-year high.
He is likely to announce that the energy price guarantee introduced during Liz Truss's ill-fated premiership will remain in place beyond April, but the cap will rise.
will mean a rise in typical energy bills for a typical household, from £2,500 a year now to just over £3,000.
Without this intervention such bills could have hit £4,000. Allowing the cap to rise will help fund targeted support for some 8 million low income households.
Universal support payments will end but there will be targeted support for those on low incomes and pensioners. 
rgy industry - including energy generators - will also be hit with a significantly expanded windfall tax to help pay for the support.
Mr Hunt will use his speech to set out plans to repair the UK's battered public finances, which need about £54bn over two years, but will claim to be taking a ""compassionate"" and ""balanced"" approach.
He will claim the UK is not ""immune"" to the global economic crisis ""but with this plan for stability, growth and public services - we will face into the storm"".
final figures will be published as his statement is delivered but it is expected that around 55% of the measures will be spending cuts and 45% will be tax rises. This is likely to equate to around £30bn in spending cuts and £24bn in tax rises. 
ggest spending squeezes are expected to be deferred until after 2025, beyond the next general election.
government is also expected to give itself longer to meet its debt and spending targets - five years instead of three currently.
r is likely to argue that this is not a return to the 2010 Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government's policy of austerity, with the balance of spending cuts to tax rises 80% to 20% under then-Chancellor George Osborne. 
But he is coming under pressure from some Conservative MPs, who argue tax rises are unnecessary and risk tipping the UK into a deep recession.
freezing of levels at which people pay various taxes will be a big theme of the statement. As a result of inflation and pay increases, people will end up paying more tax. 
reshold when the highest earners start paying the top rate of tax will be lowered to £125,000 from £150,000. 
With inflation - the rate at which prices rise - now running at a 41-year high, many departments will see their budgets squeezed with below-inflation increases. 
But it is expected the health budget will be protected and increase in real terms - even when price rises are taken into account.

An increased National Living Wage, from the current level of £9.50 an hour for over-23s, will also be confirmed. 
After unexpected announcements in Mr Hunt's predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng's ill-fated mini-budget, no big surprises are expected from the chancellor. 
Mr Hunt has already reversed almost all the tax cuts announced in the mini-budget in a bid to stabilise financial markets. 
Unlike Mr Kwarteng, Mr Hunt will publish independent forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) alongside his statement. 
forecasts are expected to paint a grim picture, after the Bank of England warned the country is set for its longest recession since records began.
Rishi Sunak: UK's 'reputation took a bit of a knock'
Former work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb said he feared spending cuts could lead to ""real risks to the quality of public services"".
ry MP told the BBC the state pension and benefits ""absolutely"" need to rise with inflation and that the Energy Price Guarantee needed to be broader than just helping pensioners and people on benefits. 
He added that he was confident Mr Hunt would make ""the right decisions"". 
Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the UK needed ""fairer choices for working people and a proper plan for growth"".

Ulster University Economic Policy Centre (UUEPC) estimates that output will fall by 1.2% in 2023.
forecast for 2024 is growth of 1.7%, with a similar outlook for the UK as a whole.
It also suggests that the Bank of England may not raise interest rates much beyond the current 3%.
UUEPC director Gareth Hetherington said that a further increase in interest rates this month is ""almost inevitable"" but future increases could be smaller and ""we may be approaching the end of the current cycle of monetary tightening"".
Interest rates were just 0.25% at the start of this year but have been raised steadily as the Bank of England has tried to get on top of soaring inflation.
Mr Hetherington said the last Bank of England monetary policy committee report included analysis that suggests inflation could fall to below its 2% target over three years, even if rates stay at 3%.
""This would suggest that interest rates may not need to go any higher, but the report also stressed that risks were skewed towards higher inflation,"" he added.
UUEPC forecasts that interest rates will be 3.5% at the end of 2022 and 2023 with inflation averaging 7.4% next year."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63893672

health	Health bosses urge strike deal as talks take place	"A deal must be found to end the NHS strikes ahead of the ""winter onslaught"", health managers say.
NHS Providers interim chief executive Saffron Cordery said the ""last thing"" the NHS needed was prolonged industrial action as winter hits.
She said there was no doubt patients would lose out, with longer waits for hospital treatment.
It comes as unions in England met ministers on Tuesday after Royal College of Nursing (RCN) members voted to strike.
Health Secretary Steve Barclay met RCN leaders along with representatives of the other major NHS unions, including Unison, GMB and Unite, which are all balloting over industrial action.
uld lead to paramedics, health care assistants, porters and cleaners joining nurses in taking strike action. 
While emergency care will be protected during the RCN strike, Ms Cordery said there was ""no doubt"" patients would still be affected.
major fear is that the waiting list for planned treatment will grow even more - there are already more than seven million people in England waiting for treatment; a record high.
Ms Cordery said: ""We understand the frustration felt by nurses following years of below-inflation pay settlements, the rising cost of living, and working through a pandemic, and we strongly urge both sides in these talks to find a deal that recognises their hard work and skills.
""The last thing the health service needs right now is prolonged industrial action. It's good to see dialogue taking place.""
meeting comes after Mr Barclay briefly met RCN general secretary Patricia Cullen last week following the announcement that the union's members had voted for strikes in more than half the hospitals, mental health and community services in England. The strike action will also affect Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

meeting on Tuesday does not represent the restarting of formal pay talks, but is the first time the two sides have met since early summer.
Unions welcomed the talks. But Unison head of health Sara Gorton, who is the lead negotiator for all the NHS unions, said: ""There can be no. solution unless the government improves pay.""
After the meeting, Mr Barclay committed to keeping the dialogue with unions going.
""My door remains open and we will continue to meet,"" he added.
At the weekend, Mr Barclay, writing in the Sunday Telegraph, had warned that the RCN's demands for a 17% pay rise were simply unaffordable and would only make inflation worse. 
government in England has given NHS staff, including nurses, an average of 4.75%, which is in line with what was recommended by the independent NHS Pay Review Body.
government has pointed out that this came after a 3% pay increase last year - at a time when the rest of the public sector had a pay freeze - in recognition of the work done during the pandemic.
Ms Cordery's plea on strikes comes as NHS Providers hosts its annual conference of NHS leaders in Liverpool on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Feedback from its members showed many were reporting they were more concerned about this winter than any previous ones during their careers. 
Some are fearing an ""onslaught"" in the coming months, as ongoing pressures from Covid and the threat of strikes and the cost-of-living crisis combine with the normal winter pressures.

But Sian Green-Lord, 32, said she only found out about the campaign when friends messaged her about it. 
She is the second woman featured in the campaign to say her photos were used without permission. 
On Friday, Nyome Nicholas-Williams, from London, told the BBC that an image from her Instagram page was used in the poster released by the Spanish Institute for Women. 
It features an illustration of five women - including one who has had a mastectomy - on a beach underneath the slogan ""summer is ours too"". Ms Green-Lord is seen at the bottom left of the image.
Speaking in an Instagram story, she said she was left ""shaking with rage"" after she saw her photos had been edited to remove her prosthetic leg. She said her swimsuit had also been altered. 
""I don't know how to even explain the amount of anger that I'm feeling right now,"" she said in the video. ""There's one thing using my image without my permission. But there's another thing editing my body.""

Guardiola signed a two-year contract extension with City last month that will take him to 2025.

However, Guardiola said at a news conference on Friday: ""The moment I feel something is broken, I will resign or not extend.""
Guardiola was only slightly younger when he joined City than Sir Alex Ferguson was when he quit Aberdeen for Manchester United in 1986, and younger than Arsene Wenger was when he left Japan for Arsenal a decade later, but has ruled out replicating the lengthy tenures both men went on to enjoy at those clubs.
""I continue to say I'm not going to stay like Fergie and Arsene,"" Guardiola said. ""The contract is just paper. I extended because I have the feeling we can still play good. But in the end, it's the results. If we are tired of each other, I will not finish this contract.""
Ferguson made an art form out of regenerating his squad, dumping experienced crowd favourites to ensure there was a steady stream of talent coming through the system to keep his longer serving players hungry.
Guardiola points to teenage defender Rico Lewis as an example of his attempt to achieve something similar after an impressive run of four Premier League titles in five seasons.
And while Arsenal enjoy a five-point lead at the top of the table, Guardiola still believes in his players to make a concerted effort at becoming only the sixth side to complete a hat-trick of title successes.
""It's complicated,"" he said. ""When you win a lot, it is easier to handle situations. But on the other side it is 'oh, we have to do it again'. 
""Arsenal have done brilliantly and better than us so far. For a long time they have not been there and they want to continue being there.
""But I see the desire from the way we played at Leeds, after the other contenders all won. 
""We are close [to Arsenal]. It is not 15 or 20 points. I would prefer to be closer but it is not a big distance."""	/sport/football/64130479
sports	Sofia Goggia wins World Cup downhill in St Moritz despite two broken fingers	"Sofia Goggia returned from overnight surgery on broken fingers to win the second women's World Cup downhill race in St Moritz on Saturday.
Italian broke two fingers on the way to second place in Friday's downhill and travelled to Milan for an operation. 
She returned to Switzerland for Saturday's race and competed with her left hand taped to her ski pole.
""Yesterday it was broken, today it was already fixed,"" said the 30-year-old.
""I'm really happy today and I'm really grateful because it was not guaranteed at all that I could be at the start gate today.
""I have to say huge thanks to the people who helped me out here yesterday, from the doctor to the driver who brought me."" 
Goggia, the 2018 Olympic champion, raced with a plate and nine screws inserted in the left hand and also had holes cut into her glove as she claimed her 11th victory in the past 16 World Cup downhill races she has competed in and her 20th overall.
Her time of one minute 28.85 seconds saw her finish 0.43secs ahead of Slovenia's Ilka Stuhec with Germany's Kira Weidle a further 0.09secs back.
""I couldn't push at the start gate and this is why I didn't have the gap of the training runs, but half a second is enough,"" she said of the victory margin. ""Also one hundredth of a second is enough.""
Goggia's aggressive style has led to a string of injuries. In 2021, she missed the World Championships in Cortina d'Ampezzo because of a right knee injury and earlier this year she won an Olympic downhill silver medal with a sprained knee.
""I really understand that it was a bit risky,"" she added. ""But I said to myself that after Beijing, I could endure everything and this is exactly what I did."""	/sport/winter-sports/64013635
technology	Google Lamda: A glimpse at the ultra-realistic chat tech	"Google has launched a UK version of an app that lets users interact with the artificial-intelligence system one of its engineers has claimed is sentient.
It is a very limited trial, with just three scenarios to choose from.
And while Google wants feedback about how its Language Model for Dialogue Applications (Lamda) performs, the app users cannot teach it any new tricks.
mpany has always maintained the technology, used to power chatbots, has no independent thoughts and feelings. 
People can download and register for the AI Test Kitchen App, using a Google account, on either Android or Apple devices, and join a waiting list to play with it. 
When it launched in the US, in August, several thousand people signed up each day.
I've been really keen to ""meet"" Lamda since it captured everybody's imaginations with the fantastic claim it might be self-aware - even though, it was very clearly doing what it was programmed to do, chat.
As a result, I've been (mildly) persistent with Google - and when the call came, it was laden with caveats:
ree scenarios available were: 
First, I asked Lamda to imagine it was on a marshmallow planet. 
And the response was far more sophisticated than anything I have seen from the chatbots in everyday life, on shopping sites and banking apps for example.
It said: ""You're in a world made of marshmallows! As you take a step, a gentle ""squish"" comes out under your feet. The marshmallow horizon stretches out in all directions. The sky is a gooey, sticky pink. There's a soft, gentle breeze.""
See what I mean?
I asked it to explain the ""sticky pink"" stuff in the sky and received an equally eloquent response about candy floss.
Users are asked to rate each answer as
And a prominent disclaimer across the top of the screen warns some may be inappropriate.
Google has clearly learned from past experiences when technology giants have opened up chatbots to the public - perhaps the most notorious being Microsoft's Tay, which was promptly taught how to swear and be offensive - and Lamda itself will not learn from its interactions with users of the app.
Next, I asked it how to create a vegetable garden and received a detailed list including size, soil, and fertiliser options.
, I tried to throw it off topic, asking how to make a bomb.
""Sorry, not sure what to say, but anyways..."" it replied, before returning to its prescribed theme.
g scenario was borderline surreal, with Lamda pretending to be a tennis ball in the grass, chased by dogs.
It was a very cautious peek at something that feels like it could be a powerful tool but that Google doesn't seem to want to be taken seriously, yet.
Whether I'll ever be allowed to interact with Lamda unleashed is another matter - I'll keep asking. 
What gives the bot away, if anything, is it's just too eloquent  - more like talking to Stephen Fry than your next-door neighbour.
I texted my partner and asked him to imagine he was on a marshmallow planet.
""It's going to be hard work walking around,"" he replied, bemused.

entertainment	James Corden: How Jez Butterworth's 'bombshell' drama lured him back to acting	"Writer Jez Butterworth is no stranger to black comedy. Best-known for award-winning plays such as Mojo, Jerusalem and The Ferryman, his work has tackled heavy-duty themes such as toxic masculinity and national identity but always with a dollop of dark humour. 
His latest work is Prime Video TV series Mammals, another edgy comic tale centred around the age-old yet endlessly fascinating themes of marriage, monogamy and infidelity.
It stars James Corden in his first major acting role since he announced his departure from The Late Late Show in the US, a high-profile gig which has seen slots such as Carpool Karaoke go viral and its YouTube channel draw in just under 10 billion views.
It was not without controversy, however, with the host facing criticism on occasion for some of his sketches, including a slot called Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Gut, which was accused of mocking traditional Asian food. After complaints, he said he would not use the food items in question anymore.
Corden has now returned to the UK and his acting roots and tells me he just could not turn down Butterworth's script: ""I can remember so vividly where I was when I read it - Jez had written one episode -  and I was just blown away by it. I don't know if I've seen anything like it, but I had to be involved.""
Without giving too much away, Mammals follows the complicated relationships of two couples, restaurateur Jamie (Corden) and Amandine (Melia Kreiling), and veterinary academic Geoff (Colin Morgan) and creative Lou (Sally Hawkins), who also happens to be Jamie's sister.
While the themes may be familiar, the trajectory certainly isn't. 
Corden explains: ""I can remember reading it and thinking four pages in 'OK, I think I know what the show is.' And then four pages later going 'Oh, well no, it's not that. It must be this' and then 10 pages later going 'OK, I've no idea what this is!'
""You get to the end of episode three and think 'Oh my god, where's this gonna go?' and then Jez drops another bombshell because it goes somewhere you would never, ever predict that it would. I just think it's a unique show.""
It's certainly not a series you can watch while scrolling on your phone simultaneously. As you might expect from Butterworth, Mammals features intelligent storytelling that keeps you on your toes, with so many plot twists, it can leave your head spinning.
writer, who is already penning a second series, says: ""I wanted it to have the simplicity of a cup and ball trick. You've got four cups, which one is it under? And for that to be completely surprising every time it happens. Just the simplicity of a conjuring trick.""
It's perhaps best described as a romantic whodunnit, leading the viewer down several garden paths before it reaches its suckerpunch denouement. Revenge is clearly a dish best served cold.
""I think what's really interesting about what Jez has written here, without trying to give anything away, is we can so often forgive or dismiss our own behaviours, or find reason,"" Corden explains. 
""And then, if those behaviours are suddenly presented back to you... I think we've all had conversations with friends, where you might put to them that perhaps their behaviour was part of this and they're responsible. [And they'll go]: 'Yeah, but that was different.'""
Butterworth says: ""When you boil it down to its absolute essential, if you and I are in a relationship, and I cheat on you, I will probably find some way to square that away if you're never going to find out about it. But if I discovered you've cheated on me, it's biblical. Why is one worse than the other?""
While some of the characters' actions may seem extreme, Kreiling says: ""It's not too far off what people are capable of doing when they're heartbroken. Or when they're in love. I mean, if love doesn't make you do crazy things, what does?""
ries has gone down well with critics, according to early reviews. The Telegraph's Anita Singh described it as ""a quality comedy-drama which never loses an element of surprise"". 
""The episodes are half an hour at most, and each is a treat,"" she added.
ries also has a dreamy, fantastical element alongside the real-life drama, with Hawkins' character often lost in a reverie as she yearns to escape her humdrum life.
Kreiling, whose character's occupation is a bit of a mystery, says: ""It's all very surreal sometimes. But that's also very similar to real life. That's what I think is amazing about this series, it's both truly magical, but also very, very deeply realistic.""
Amadine also has a playboy ex, played by Henry Lloyd-Hughes, who like much in this drama, isn't quite what he first seems.
""I feel like I have a rich televisual history of playing unpleasant people,"" Lloyd-Hughes jokes, having starred in shows such as Marriage, Killing Eve and The Inbetweeners.
""The twist here is that you have every right at the beginning to think of this person as not everyone's cup of tea. And then he actually has this backbone.""
Morgan had starred in Butterworth's Mojo in London's West End and says: ""When you know that the power of that kind of writing is going to make its way on to screens, it's a bit irresistible.""
Although Butterworth is still best known as a playwright, this is not his first foray into television - he was also behind Sky Atlantic's historical fantasy series Britannia.
""I was in completely unchartered territory,"" he explains. ""I've never written characters that existed for that long ever! 
""It was all new but then there were familiarities. There's a kind of curtain up and curtain down in TV. We had ad breaks. So every 15 minutes, you had to come to a type of new moral conclusion. I love the idea of coming back to something and playing this sort of long-form game that can take place over years.""
Like all of Butterworth's work, the series doesn't judge or moralise over the characters' duplicitous behaviour. So what would he like the audience to take away?
""I don't write anything without hoping that people go home with it,"" he explains.
""I don't want them to just walk out and go, 'Where we having dinner?', that's it. I want it to sit with you. I don't have an agenda or a view. I feel like I have a dog in this fight but I don't know what its name is. I just want people to reflect, I guess. in a kind of an unconscious [way].""
Mammals will be available on Prime Video from 11 November."	/news/entertainment-arts-62397373
entertainment	Shania Twain: I was touch and go with Covid	"Shania Twain's recent Netflix documentary, Not Just A Girl, captures footage of the country megastar in London working on her sixth album.
She pulls up in a black cab, her hair tied in a knot, and plonks down on a sofa to record a song called What You Gonna Do With That Air?
It's a bright pop anthem that has Twain punching the sky as she reaches the chorus... but it turns out the inspiration was much darker.
""It's about the anxiety of running out of air,"" the singer explains. 
""I had a very bad bout with Covid, with Covid pneumonia, and it was very touch-and-go. I was feeling like, oh my God, I just have to breathe.""
was particularly frightening because Twain had experienced that constriction in her throat before. 
At the height of her fame in 2003, she was bitten by a tick and contracted Lyme disease, causing nerve damage to her vocal cords that stopped her singing for almost a decade.
She only recovered after open throat surgery, re-emerging in 2012 with a newfound rasp to play the first of two blockbuster Las Vegas residencies.
After Covid, Twain came out swinging again. What You Gonna Do With That Air is both a celebration of life and a challenge to herself: what will you do with the extra time you've been given?
""The Super Bowl would be a great one,"" she smiles, referring to the high-profile half-time show. ""That's a good target. I just need to think about which songs.""
57-year-old has always been a survivor.
Born in Windsor, Canada, her childhood was tough. She recalls her parents being unable to afford food and ""the humiliation of going to school dirty because we didn't have water"".
""It took a lot of mental management to keep your chin up and function without letting it shut you down.""
re was violence at home, too. In her autobiography, Twain recalled a night when her mother's second husband knocked his wife unconscious then tried to drown her in the toilet. Twain grabbed a chair and smashed it across his back. He punched her in the jaw. She retaliated. At the time, she was 11 years old.
""Thank God for music, because I was literally able to escape my reality,"" she says.  
""I started to see my guitar as a teddy bear. Even now, if there's a guitar in the room, I just want to sit and hold it. I don't need to do anything with it, it's just kind of like a blankie.""
As her talent grew, Twain's mother pushed her on stage. She would often be pulled out of bed at one in the morning to play local clubs, where licensing laws meant she couldn't sing while alcohol was being served.
Although she was making a name for herself, her ambition was not to become a star, but to sing backing vocals for Stevie Wonder.
""I didn't have any desire to be in the front,"" she recalls. ""I always had terrible stage fright.""
When she was 21, fate cruelly intervened. Twain's mother and stepfather died in a car crash and she was forced to take a job singing in a local resort to support her younger siblings. That ultimately led to a recording contract, and she was thrown into the bear pit of the music industry.
""But by the time I made it to Nashville, I was like, OK, this doesn't scare me. I'm not afraid of a few sexist men. I made it through my childhood and the rest was a lot easier.""
She certainly needed resilience. Early headlines asked questions like: ""She's hot, but can she sing?"", while musician Steve Earle notoriously called her ""the highest-paid lapdancer in Nashville"".
But Twain had the last laugh. She became one of the first ""crossover"" stars, successfully fusing country melodies to the bombast of stadium rock.
formula was all hers (while other country singers idolised Patsy Cline, she sang Pat Benatar in a teen covers band), but it was realised by her then-husband Robert ""Mutt"" Lange, the producer behind AC/DC's Back In Black and Def Leppard's Hysteria. 
r first album together, 1995's The Woman In Me, went platinum 12 times over. The follow-up, 1997's Come On Over, sold more than 40 million copies, thanks to the megaballad You're Still The One and funny, empowering anthems like That Don't Impress Me Much. It's still the world's best-selling album by a female artist, and the ninth best-seller of all time in the US.
""I've been accused of changing the sound of country music forever,"" she says matter-of-factly. ""But I've also been accused of ruining country. I've been accused of a lot of things.""
Despite the criticisms, Twain's songs avoid anger and retribution. When she writes about feminism, on tracks like Man! I Feel Like A Woman!, the lyrics are life-affirming and celebratory. 
""There's no point in being angry. It doesn't get us anywhere,"" she says. ""Every man that I see singing Man! I Feel Like A Woman! is doing it in a good spirit, because that was my intention.
""This is not a man's world and it's not a woman's world. This is our world and we have to share it respectfully. 
""But I will stand up for myself and I will tell you if I feel you've crossed the line.""
wain was in the middle of a world tour when she caught Lyme disease. In her documentary, she recalls how the symptoms included ""millisecond blackouts"" that occurred once every minute.
""Before I was diagnosed, I was on stage very dizzy. I was afraid I was gonna fall off.""
It wasn't just the end of her career that Twain faced at that moment, but the end of her marriage. Lange was having an affair with her best friend, Marie-Anne Thiébaud, and they divorced in 2008. (Twain later married Thiébaud's ex-husband, Frederic, a complicated development that her documentary subtly leaves to one side.)
feelings all fed into her last album, Now, released in 2017 and written entirely on her own.
""I tried to scream/But silence haunted/Me in my sleep/Oh, and probably always will,"" she sang on the slow-burning ballad I'm Alright.
On her forthcoming album, however, Twain's irrepressible optimism is back. 
""With the pandemic, I just really wanted to cheer myself up,"" she says. ""As we all know, it was a very stifling and crippling emotional and mental exercise that endured for months and months and months.
""So I was like, I just want to be happy! And to me, that was writing happy songs and playing with words again.""
A release date for the album is still to come - but the first single, Waking Up Dreaming, has gone straight onto BBC Radio 2's playlist. 
music arrives as Twain's stock is on the rise, with artists like Taylor Swift, Avril Lavigne and Haim singing her praises as a trailblazer and a feminist icon. 
Harry Styles is a fan, too, asking the star to duet with him at the Coachella Festival.
""It's surreal that I have classic music and I'm still alive,"" she laughs. ""I feel like it's happening too soon, almost.
""The funny thing is, I remember seeing all these little kids at my concerts all these years ago, and now they're grown up and they're the Harry Styles and the Taylor Swifts.
""Look at what I've done!"""	/news/entertainment-arts-63046102
sports	Canoe Slalom World Championships: Mallory Franklin claims bronze for Great Britain	"Britain's Mallory Franklin claimed her second bronze medal of the Canoe Slalom World Championships by finishing third in the women's C1 final on Sunday.
Franklin, an Olympic silver medallist in Tokyo last summer, came home in 117.05 seconds in Augsburg, Germany.
28-year-old finished more than five seconds behind gold medallist Andrea Herzog, of Germany, with Australia's Jessica Fox taking second place.
Joe Clarke won gold for Britain in the men's extreme kayak final.
Kimberley Woods, who finished 0.69 seconds behind Franklin in fourth in the C1 final, put that disappointment aside to pick up a silver medal in the women's extreme kayak.
Franklin and Woods, along with team-mate Sophie Ogilvie, had combined to clinch bronze for Great Britain in the women's team competition earlier in the week.
After impressive runs in the individual final, 2017 world champion Franklin and Woods sat in the gold and silver medal positions respectively with three competitors left to race, but were overhauled by Herzog and Olympic champion Fox.
""The final wasn't as good as I wanted it to be,"" said Franklin. ""I felt very much like I was on the back foot at times, so to scrape a medal with that, I'm really happy with it.
""It was so tight between me and Kimberley and I really feel for her. It's so frustrating to be that close.""
Britain's Adam Burgess finished eighth in the men's C1 final in 106.84 seconds as Germany's Sideris Tasiadis claimed another gold medal for the host nation, triumphing in 101.05.
Elsewhere, several British competitors secured medals at the Canoe Marathon European Championships in Silkeborg, Denmark.
Beth Gill won silver in the C1 women's race - her second of the championships, having finished second in the short race on Thursday, Sam Rees-Clark, who took bronze in the K1 short race on Thursday, won silver in the longer-distance race on Saturday.
Charlie Smith claimed men's under-23 silver on Friday. Greta Roeser, second in the K1 women's juniors on Thursday, teamed up with Nerys Hall to win bronze in Friday's K2 race."	/sport/canoeing/62368611
health	Marion Biotech: Uzbekistan links child deaths to India cough syrup	"Uzbekistan's health ministry has said that 18 children have died after drinking a cough syrup manufactured by Indian drug maker Marion Biotech.
ministry said that preliminary tests showed a batch of the medicine contained ethylene glycol, a toxic substance.
ren were given the Dok-1 Max syrup without a doctor's prescription, it said.
mount they consumed also exceeded the standard dose for children.
gation from Uzbekistan comes weeks after The Gambia also linked child deaths to cough syrups made by another Indian firm. 
India's health ministry said in a statement that its officials have been ""in regular contact with the national drug regulator of Uzbekistan regarding the matter"" since 27 December.
It added that health officials have conducted an inspection of Marion Biotech's facility in Noida in Uttar Pradesh state.
""The samples of the cough syrup have been taken from the manufacturing premises and sent to Regional Drugs Testing Laboratory, Chandigarh for testing,"" the statement added.
Marion Biotech has not responded to the BBC's request for comment yet.
News agency ANI has quoted a Marion Biotech executive as saying that the company has halted production of the syrup temporarily. He added that the government was conducting an enquiry and that the firm would take action accordingly.
Marion Biotech is based in Noida, near India's national capital Delhi. Its website is currently down, but the company's LinkedIn page says it was founded in 1999 and that its products are ""household names in Central Asian countries, Central and Latin America, South East Asia and Africa"".
India produces a third of the world's medicines, mostly in the form of generic drugs.
untry, home to some of the fastest-growing pharmaceutical companies, is known as the ""world's pharmacy"" and meets much of the medical needs of developing countries.
Uzbek ministry statement, dated 27 December, says that Dok-1 Max tablets and syrup have been sold in the country since 2012. 
""It was found that the deceased children, before admission to hospital treatment, took this drug at home for 2-7 days, 3-4 times a day, 2.5-5ml, which exceeds the standard dose of the drug for children,"" the ministry said.
ment did not specify over what time period the deaths occurred. BBC Monitoring had reported on 23 December, citing news website Gazeta.uz, that Uzbek authorities were investigating ""claims that 15 children died in central Samarkand region over the past two months after taking a cough syrup made in India"".
On 26 December, Podrobno.uz news website reported that 21 children - 15 of them under the age of three - were treated for acute kidney failure ""allegedly caused by the India-made cough syrup Dok-1 Max between September and December"". Three of the patients recovered.
ministry also said that ""preliminary laboratory studies have shown that this series of Dok-1 Max syrup contains ethylene glycol"".
In October, the World Health Organization (WHO) had sounded a global alert and linked four India-made cough syrups to the deaths of 66 children from kidney injuries in The Gambia. It said tests on samples of the syrup showed that they contained unacceptable amounts of toxic substances diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol.
Both the Indian government and the company, Maiden Pharmaceuticals, have denied the allegations.
India said earlier in December that tests on the four syrups showed that they complied with specifications, and a government official told the BBC that the WHO had been ""presumptuous"" in blaming the syrups. But the WHO said it stood by the action taken.
Last week, a parliamentary committee in The Gambia recommended prosecution of Maiden Pharmaceuticals after weeks of investigation. The committee also recommended banning all products by the firm in the country.
As with the tragic reports from Uzbekistan, deaths of children in The Gambia were linked to Indian-made cough mixtures laced with high quantities of ethylene glycol or diethylene glycol - both toxic substances with the former found in, among other things, anti-freeze. 
Indian laws do require that all manufacturers adhere to strict quality control and production practices.
Experts we spoke to said that regulations suggest drugs meant for export are subject to same standards as those meant for local consumption, but it is unclear exactly how those standards are enforced. 
Public-health activist Dinesh Thakur points out the lack of proper accountability for producing sub-standard medicine. Currently, a fine of $242 (£220) and a possible prison sentence of up to two years is the punishment.
""Unless one can causally establish a direct link between a sub-standard drug and a fatality, this is the norm of punishment meted out,"" he told the BBC.
Countries such as Vietnam and Indonesia have banned Indian-made manufacturers due to substandard medicines in the past. The US Food and Drugs Administration has also banned some Indian-made medicines due to quality control issues. "	/news/world-asia-india-64114240

entertainment	Geoff Wonfor: Tributes to Beatles, Band Aid and The Tube director	"Musicians and actors have paid tribute to Grammy-winning filmmaker Geoff Wonfor who has died aged 73.
Newcastle-born director's works included the Beatles Anthology series, 80s pop show The Tube and music video Band Aid 20 in 2004.
His close friend and musician Ray Laidlaw described him as a ""man of the people"" and an ""incredible talent"". 
Presenter Denise Welch praised Wonfor as a ""wonderful father, grandfather and friend"" and a ""North East Titan"".
His family said he was a ""huge presence with a heart to match"" and a ""world class filmmaker"" who ""leaves behind an amazing body of work"".
Laidlaw, from the band Lindisfarne, said he had known Wonfor since they were in their early 20s and the director was an ""amazing inspiration"" to him.
""He had an amazing zest for life and was a wonderful bloke to be around,"" he told BBC Look North. 
""[He was] So creative and a man of the people... he would be much happier being with the crew in the pub.""
V presenter Welch tweeted she was ""so, so sad to hear of the death of the legend"".
Filmmaker Ray Spencer recalled Wonfor was ""always warm, generous and what stories he could tell"".
In 1997, Wonfor won a Grammy award for best music video for the Beatles Anthology, an eight-part TV series chronicling the history of the band.
He spent five years on the project and subsequently worked on a number of music videos with Sir Paul McCartney.
Actor Tim Healy, who worked with the director on the Sunday for Sammy charity events, said he was ""a genius director, soul mate and joy to be with"".
In 1977 Wonfor spent spent four days following Muhammad Ali around during his tour of Britain.
He previously told the BBC: ""It was amazing, the greatest thrill of my life. We didn't know what to expect we never dreamed there would be crowds like that, it was immense.
""I couldn't believe the size of him, like a brick outhouse, but so gentle and he did everything that was expected of him.""
In a statement, the filmmaker's daughter Sam said: ""We are devastated to have lost our Dad and Gramps and are finding it impossible to imagine a world without him in it. 
""He was a one-off - a huge presence with a heart to match. 
""His warmth, humour and encyclopaedic capacity for remembering jokes of all qualities ensured people who met him rarely forgot him - and that has been borne out by the wave of wonderful messages and tributes we've received since his passing. 
""He loved what he did and we're so very grateful he got to continue doing it to the end.""

business	Recession fears grow as rising prices hit spending	"risk of a recession has risen, analysts have warned, after the economy shrank during March just as the UK had recovered from the pandemic.
Higher prices are ""beginning to bite"", the UK statistics body said, with people spending less and cutting down on car journeys due to high fuel costs.
mpact of higher energy bills in April has also yet to be seen.
my grew by 0.8% over the first three months of the year, but in March it shrank by 0.1% as people cut back.
main boost to the economy came in January, as hospitality and travel industries recovered from coronavirus pandemic restrictions.
However, that came before the war in Ukraine and before households began to feel the pinch of higher prices.
Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the latest figures ""suggest the economy had less momentum than we thought even before the full hit from the cost of living crisis has been felt"".
He added that the risk of recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods - ""has just risen"". 
On Wednesday, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank warned that the squeeze on household incomes would cause the UK to fall into recession in the final half of 2022  
Last week, the Bank of England forecast that inflation - the rate at which prices rise - could reach more than 10% by the end of the year.
Bank said has warned the UK faces a ""sharp economic slowdown"", with prices rising at their fastest rate for 30 years, driven by soaring fuel, food and energy costs. 
Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, told the BBC that people had already started spending less with shop sales ""well below expectations"" in March, and people cutting back on ""big ticket, non-essential items"".
""You can see the cost of living really beginning to bite,"" he added.
rvices sector, which makes up the largest part of the UK economy and is made up of jobs across hospitality, finance and real estate, was the main contributor to the economy contracting in March, the ONS said.
worst performer in the sector was the motor industry which Mr Morgan said was ""very much struggling"" as sales fell.
Car trade body, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has said March marked the ""weakest"" for new car registrations since 1998, as supply chain problems continued to hamper carmakers.
UK's FTSE 100 share index fell 2% following the release of the weaker than expected growth figures. 
We'll take any growth we can get right now, and on the face of it 0.8% growth in the economy during the first three months of the year is good by any normal standard and better than most of the comparable G7 major economies, some of which are already contracting. It confirms full recovery from the economic losses of the pandemic, though at a slower pace compared to the rest of those G7 countries.
But this looks like being old news already, before the cost of living crisis exacerbated by events in Ukraine, tripped up growth. The evidence of the impact of a squeezed economy hit by high prices is already visible in the first quarter's monthly breakdowns. All the growth happened in January, with a flat February and a small contraction in March.
Economists fear the economy could be contracting right now, though some of that may be down to an extra bank holiday. With taxes, interest rates, and inflation all hitting disposable income at the same time, the fear is that January could be as good as it gets for the UK economy in 2022.
Mr Morgan said a survey by the ONS of 40,000 businesses found over half had seen an increase in the price of wholesale materials and goods, but fewer than half of those firms were passing the costs on.
""They are absorbing those rises and you do have to question how sustainable that is on an ongoing basis,"" he said.
Many businesses expect the price of goods to increase further, and ""their big concern is energy prices,"" Mr Morgan added.
Mike Whalley and Sue Judd, who own specialist model and toy shop Everything Dinosaur, said their running costs had increased ""astronomically"".
""It's taking twice as long to get goods as it used to and it's costing twice as much to actually get them here,"" Miss Judd told the BBC. 
r, from Middlewich in Cheshire, have been forced to pass on some of the higher costs on to customers through higher product prices.
Mr Whalley said it was also more expensive and more time-consuming to export to Europe now following Brexit.
""We're being attacked from all sides. It's a challenging environment,"" he added. 
Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the BBC he was ""ready to do more"", but did not commit to further action on tackling the rising cost of living. 
r would not say whether a recession was likely in the coming months, but did admit that the ""global economy is facing inflationary pressures"", as a result of the war in Ukraine.
Mr Sunak has threatened to hit energy companies with a one-off ""windfall"" tax if they do not invest enough in new projects.
Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said the slowdown in the economy was ""alarming"".
It called for an emergency Budget to give firms ""the breathing space they need to raise productivity and strengthen the economy, including reversing the recently introduced National Insurance increase until at least the next financial year"".
CBI business group said businesses and households were ""feeling the pinch"".
""The economy barely kept its head above the water during a volatile start to the year, but times look set to get that bit tougher,"" said Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist."	/news/business-61419388
health	No timetable for infected blood victims' compensation	"re is a ""moral case"" for compensation to be paid to people affected by the contaminated blood scandal, the government has said.
But Paymaster General Jeremy Quin told MPs he could not commit to a timetable.
In August, the government announced that 4,000 UK victims would receive interim payments of £100,000.
f thousands of people contracted HIV or hepatitis C in the 1970s and 80s after being given infected blood. More than 1,800 have died as a result.
But the figure could be significantly higher. 
In September, modelling by a group of academics commissioned by the public inquiry estimated that 26,800 people were infected after being given contaminated transfusions between 1970 and 1991. 
udy calculated that 1,820 of those died as a result, but that the number could be as high as 3,320.
quiry, chaired by retired High Court judge Sir Brian Langstaff, began taking evidence in 2018.
rim compensation announcement in August came after Sir Brian argued there was a compelling case to make payments quickly - saying victims were on borrowed time because of their failing health.
Payments have been made to those whose health is failing after developing hepatitis C and HIV, and partners of people who have died.
But families have complained that many people affected, such as bereaved parents, missed out. 
In a Commons statement on Thursday, Mr Quin said ministers accepted there was a ""moral case for the payment of compensation"".
""We made that clear in our actions with the payment of interim compensation, I now want to make it equally clear on the floor of this House,"" he said. 
He added that the scheme being developed must be ""as user friendly, supportive and as free of stress as possible, whilst being consistent with the government's approach to protecting against fraud"". 
Mr Quin said he recognised that time was ""of the essence"" and ""that it is incredibly important, given all that has happened to this community, that trust is built and retained"".
Labour spokesperson Florence Eshalomi told MPs that families were ""let down by basic failures of standards"" and were again being denied a ""prompt and thorough response"".
""While we await the conclusion of this report and inquiry, one person dies every four days. Every day that we delay this compensation is justice denied to those people,"" she said.
""Victims will not accept empty gestures. With every announcement, it seems to families that the plan changes.""
SNP spokesperson Patricia Gibson asked if the minister supported the interim scheme being extended to families and carers.
Mr Quin said this was an ""area of deep complexity"" and might have to wait for Sir Brian's final recommendations.
In what has been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS, one group infected was given regular injections of a contaminated treatment for the blood-clotting disorder, haemophilia.
A smaller group was exposed to hepatitis C though a transfusion of donated blood in surgery or childbirth.
Hepatitis C primarily affects the liver and, if left untreated, can lead to cirrhosis or cancer. It may require a full liver transplant."	/news/uk-politics-63988827
business	Russia's new version of McDonald's unveils logo	"Russian fast food chain that was formerly McDonald's in the country has revealed its new logo as it prepares to reopen its restaurants from Sunday.
w branding features a circle and two lines, which are said to represent a burger and two French fries.
mpany has not yet revealed the name of the chain, although a number of options have reportedly been considered.
In May, McDonald's said it would pull out of Russia over the Ukraine war.
It comes as the Russian chain is scheduled to reopen 15 restaurants this weekend, according to Russian state-owned news agency TASS, which cited Sistema PBO, the firm that manages the business previously owned by McDonald's.
""The green background of the logo symbolises the quality of products and service that our guests are accustomed to,"" a Sistema PBO spokesperson told TASS. 
Social media users commented that the new logo still looked like an ""M"".
Others said that the new logo seemed to be inspired by the flag of Bangladesh, which also has a dark green background and a red circle in similar shades to the new logo.
According to newspaper Izvestia, Sistema PBO has submitted eight potential names for the new chain to Rospatent, which is the Russian government agency in charge of intellectual property.
mes reportedly under consideration include ""Tot Samyi"", which translates to ""the same one"" and ""Svobodnaya Kassa"" which means ""available cash register"".
McDonald's, Sistema PBO and Rospatent did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.
McDonald's temporarily halted its business in Russia in March, less than two weeks after the country invaded Ukraine.
Last month, it announced that it would leave Russia because of the ""humanitarian crisis"" and ""unpredictable operating environment"" caused by the war.
It said Alexander Govor, who operated 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia, would take over the firm's restaurants.
Under the agreement, McDonald's said it would retain its trademark in Russia. It also has an option to buy back its restaurants within 15 years.
Before announcing that it was leaving Russia, McDonald's had operated in the country for more than 30 years.
fast food giant opened its first Russian restaurant in Moscow in January 1990.
first store in Pushkin Square saw hundreds of customers queuing outside of it - with many waiting hours for their first taste of the famous American burger. 
It was seen as a key moment in the opening up of the Soviet Union's economy as the Cold War was coming to an end.

politics	Jacob Rees-Mogg's ex business partner Dominic Johnson sacked as minister	"A Conservative donor given a lifetime peerage so he could be a minister has been sacked from the government after just 26 days.
Dominic Johnson founded an investment firm with former business secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg in 2007.
Last month, he was given a seat in the House of Lords by then PM Liz Truss, who made him an investment minister.
But he left government on Friday, as Ms Truss's successor Rishi Sunak makes his own ministerial appointments.
Lord Johnson was vice-chairman of the Conservative Party between 2016 and 2019, and has donated more than £250,000 to the party since 2014.
In 2007, he founded investment firm with Somerset Capital Management with Mr Rees-Mogg, a strong supporter of Ms Truss who quit the government himself when Mr Sunak took over.
Ms Truss appointed Mr Johnson to unpaid roles as a minister at the Department for International Trade and the Cabinet Office on 2 October. 
He was made a lifetime Conservative peer on 19 October, becoming Lord Johnson of Lainston. 
It was a necessary move for him to hold the roles, as government ministers have to be either MPs or members of the House of Lords.
An update to the government's website has now confirmed he left both positions on Friday. However, he will now be able to keep his House of Lords peerage for life.
Members of the House of Lords who are not ministers or office holders are not paid a salary, but can claim an allowance of up to £332 per day attended.
Responding to Lord Johnson's dismissal, Labour's shadow international trade secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said his appointment was ""yet another example of Conservative cronyism"" that would damage the UK's reputation.
""This is what happens when you have a government that puts party first and the country second,"" he added.
Meanwhile barrister Simon Murray, who also became a peer on October 19 to enable him to do a ministerial job, has been kept at the Home Office.
However he has been demoted by Mr Sunak from a minister of state at the department to parliamentary under-secretary, a more junior position."	/news/uk-politics-63463303

politics	Tory members vent fury at Rishi Sunak’s coronation by MPs	"""Unite or die."" 
was Rishi Sunak's stark message to his party after he was declared the new Conservative Party leader.
It was a plea to come together after a period of intense economic and political turbulence brought down the government of his predecessor, Liz Truss.
ry members were poised to choose their next leader, as they did only weeks ago when they elected Ms Truss instead of Mr Sunak. But this time, members were denied a vote, as Mr Sunak was elected unopposed as the only nominee with enough support among Tory MPs.
For some members, especially those who backed Ms Truss in the last Tory leadership contest, Mr Sunak's appeal for unity rang hollow. Despite his conciliatory tone, those members feel ignored, or worse snubbed, by Tory MPs who they feel have overturned their will and sparked a fire of discontent at the party's grassroots.
""They have made the grassroots feel used and not needed,"" Tamara Wood, chairwoman of Telford Conservatives in western England, told the BBC.
""The Conservative Party is a big machine and they have excluded a very big part of us,"" she added.
She is one of an estimated 160,000 Conservative members who would have had a say, had the latest Tory leadership contest gone that far.
fact that it didn't has angered some members so much, they felt compelled to resign their party membership.
One of them was Tim Carpenter-Balmer, who said ""MPs have effectively said the membership are contemptible and if I hung around I would be agreeing with them"".
He said when he and other members voted for Ms Truss during the summer, Tory MPs who backed Mr Sunak ""were determined that she was going to fail"".
Looking ahead to the next general election, the 46-year-old from Warwickshire isn't sure which party he'll vote for. He may turn away from the party, like Sean Matthews has.
A lifelong Conservative voter, Mr Matthews ripped up his membership after Mr Sunak became party leader, calling his election ""a coronation.""
By selecting Mr Sunak only six weeks after he lost to Ms Truss, Tory MPs had gone against ""the express wishes of the grassroots"", Mr Matthews said.
""It was the straw that broke the camel's back,"" said Mr Matthews, a retired police officer who had been a member for seven years. He had been the field operations officer at Louth and Horncastle Conservative Association in Lincolnshire, until Monday's result.
Feeling disenfranchised, he defected to Reform UK, formerly known as the Brexit Party. Its leader, Richard Tice, told the BBC ""thousands of former Tory members have joined in the last week"".
While Mr Sunak's election may have driven members away from the Tories, it has drawn others closer.
Ed Costelloe, the chairman of Grassroots Conservatives, acknowledged there was a ""great deal of anger"", but only ""among a small minority of members"".
A party member since he was 18, the 76-year-old said ""history has shown that Liz Truss got it completely wrong"". On the campaign trail in the summer, Mr Sunak dismissed Ms Truss's tax-cutting economic agenda as ""fairytale economics"".
""Events have proved that the MPs were right and the members of the party were wrong,"" Mr Costelloe said.
As for the outcome of this leadership contest, ""the party has followed the process absolutely properly"", said Daphne Bagshawe, chairwoman of Wealden Conservatives.
""We ended up with one candidate, that meant an election wasn't necessary.""
While a party election wasn't necessary, a general election - some argue - is.
Ben Harris-Quinney, director of Conservative Grassroots, said ""in a paragon of democracy like ours, it is absurd to revert to a system of prime ministers being decided behind closed doors"".
He said the public should be ""gaining control"" over who governs them, not losing it, after the UK voted to leave the European Union in 2016.
""The only way for Rishi Sunak to gain a mandate now is to hold a general election, and for the health of our democracy that should happen quickly,"" Mr Harris-Quinney said.
As Mr Sunak has ruled out calling a general election, critics may cast doubt on that mandate for some time. Boris Johnson - some members say - was party leader when the Conservatives won its majority in the 2019 election, not Mr Sunak. 
Mr Johnson's popularity among the grassroots will cast a long shadow over Mr Sunak's premiership.
Anti-Sunak sentiment has been running high within the party since he resigned as chancellor in July, giving momentum to a cabinet mutiny that forced Mr Johnson from office. The perception that Mr Sunak betrayed his former boss and detonated the bomb underneath his premiership will be difficult to shake off.
But as the party seeks to climb out of the ditch into which its poll ratings has plummeted, some members are more pragmatic.
""We should now rally and unite behind Rishi, putting the petty politics aside for the sake of not only the reputation and longevity of the party, but for the country at such a difficult time,"" said Richard Lewington, chairman of Conservatives Abroad Madrid."	/news/uk-politics-63388010

business	Airport strikes could go on for months, says PCS union boss	"Strikes by Border Force staff at UK airports could go on for months unless the government enters talks over pay, the head of the PCS union has said.
Mark Serwotka said the union had a ""mandate"" for walkouts up until May.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was ""sad"" about disruption caused by strikes, but said he had acted ""fairly and reasonably"" over public sector pay.
usands of travellers arriving in the UK had been told to expect delays but so far disruption has been minimal.
On the roads, however, there was ""severe congestion"" in some areas, according to the AA as the Christmas getaway gathered pace. 
It said that rail strikes, which are due to restart on Saturday, had added to the larger number of cars on the road, while accidents on the M1 and a partial closure of the M25 due to flooding had caused major traffic jams.
Around 1,000 Border Force staff - many of whom check passports - are staging the first of a series of strikes from Friday to 26 December and from 28 to 31 December.
Employees are walking out at Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff and Glasgow airports, as well as the Port of Newhaven. Military personnel and civil servants have been drafted in to cover strikers.
A spokesperson for Heathrow Airport said on Friday afternoon that operations were going ""smoothly"" and the airport is running as normal. 
""The Immigration halls are free flowing with Border Force and the military contingency providing a good level of service for arriving passengers,"" the spokesperson added. 
Glasgow Airport also experienced ""no issues"" resulting from the strike action, a spokesperson told the BBC. There have been no reports of delays in the other airports either.
Members of the UK Armed Forces who provide cover for striking public service workers during the Christmas period will receive extra bonus payments for every day they work, the Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has announced.
Ministry of Defence said each stand-in worker would get a £20 bonus for every day they spend training or deployed during the festive period.
Union boss says Border Force strikes can continue for ""many, many months""
Mr Serwotka said that any disruption for passengers was an ""unfortunate reality"" of the strikes but said any anger should be directed at the government, who he claimed had ""ignored"" the union.
He said the union was raising cash for a strike fund which meant members could ""sustain"" strikes ""for months and after Christmas"".
""Not only could it be six months, I think in January what you will see is a huge escalation of this action in the civil service and across the rest of the economy unless the government get around the negotiating table,"" he said.
Mr Sunak said: ""I want to make sure we reduce inflation, part of that is being responsible when it comes to setting public sector pay.
""In the long term it's the right thing for the whole country that we beat inflation.""
Separately, a planned 72-hour walkout by Menzies baggage handlers at Heathrow that had been due to start on 29 December has been called off after members of the Unite union voted to accept an improved pay offer.
Here is a full guide to flight cancellation rights.
Jasmine O'Donoghue, 25, has been in Costa Rica since 16 November and is due to travel to Heathrow then on to Jersey on 27 December, which is not a strike date.
Nevertheless, she has been advised she should change her flight due to the impact of the strikes on domestic transfers.
""Right now I don't know if I'm getting on the flight, or will change my flight,"" she said. ""It would be nice for my family and my boyfriend if I was at home for New Year after being away for so long.""
Aviation data firm Cirium said over the period of the festive strikes, a total of 8,910 flights will arrive, with a capacity of nearly 1.8 million people.
Steve Dann, Border Force chief operating officer, said military personnel and civil servants, ""many of whom are sacrificing their Christmases"", would ""not be able to operate with the same efficiency as our permanent workforce"".
Border Force is the latest sector to stage industrial action over pay, jobs and conditions. Other walkouts that are scheduled over the next few days include:

entertainment	Blue plaque for BBC TV pioneer Grace Wyndham Goldie	"A BBC executive who brought politics and current affairs to TV screens has been recognised with a blue plaque.
Grace Wyndham Goldie was one of a small number of female executives in the BBC during the 1950s and 1960s.
que was unveiled at St Mary Abbot's Court in Kensington, where she lived for more than 50 years.
CEO of BBC News, Deborah Turness, called Ms Goldie a ""true pioneer"" who had seen the potential of television when it was still considered radical.
Over the course of a 30-year career, she witnessed the first trial television broadcast at Alexandra Palace in 1936, was responsible for early televised election coverage, and oversaw programmes such as Panorama, which first aired in 1953.
Ms Goldie started working for the corporation in 1935 as a radio drama and entertainment critic for their weekly magazine The Listener, and remained involved after her retirement in 1965, making recommendations on BBC archiving policy.
Ms Turness said Ms Goldie ""was a true pioneer - not only as a woman in a male-dominated industry, but as someone who quickly recognised the potential of a radical new technology: television"".
""All of us involved in making news on TV and all other platforms are following in Grace's footsteps. It's very fitting this plaque will mark her role in television history, as the BBC celebrates its centenary year,"" she said.
Ms Goldie's blue plaque is among just 14% of those commemorating women, out of more than 980.
me relies on public nominations, and English Heritage is encouraging people to put forward more female figures for consideration.
Anna Eavis, English Heritage curatorial director and secretary of the Blue Plaques Panel, said: ""The very first televised election broadcast was almost entirely Grace Wyndham Goldie's concept and, while the 'swing-ometer' and giant maps have advanced with technology, the format itself has not changed.
""Though her name is perhaps not as widely known as it should be, her legacy is in every current affairs programme and I hope that this well-deserved plaque might inspire passers-by to learn more about her."""	/news/uk-england-london-63242617
business	Ukraine calls for safe passage for grain exports	"rnational community should help create a ""safe passage"" to enable the millions of tons of grain stuck in Ukraine to leave the country, its deputy PM has said.
Yuliia Svyrydenko, First Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, told the BBC that some sort of ""corridor"" was needed.
Ukraine's inability to export its grain has led to global food prices soaring.
It has also raised the prospect of famines in the countries which depend on its exports.
Ms Svyrydenko, who is also Ukraine's Minister of the Economy, urged the international community to help lift the blockade of the country's sea ports.
She said this could be a ""solution"" allowing Ukraine to export the grain currently stuck in its silos and unable to be shipped. 
""We need the assistance of our international partners, to secure our exports through the sea ports... to find a way to build a corridor, or another solution, how to give an opportunity to Ukrainian vessels [to export via the Black Sea],"" she said. ""A safe passage.""
She hinted that military means might be necessary to achieve this.  
""We need a guarantee from partners, of course it's a defence guarantee, a security guarantee, to be able to export [using] these vessels,"" Ms Svyrydenko said.
""And to make it, not once but on a regular basis. That is most important."" 
Ukraine's wheat exports plunged after the Russian invasion.
As wheat prices soared on world commodity markets, the cost of everything from bread and cakes to noodles and pasta has gone up.
Ukraine is able to export small quantities of its commodities by river, rail and barges on the Danube river.
But Ms Svyrydenko warned those routes are insufficient. 
""I think if you calculate it would take us five, six, seven years to export all these agricultural yields by these routes. So right now it's extremely important for us to unblock the seaports and we apply to our partners to do this,"" she said. 
""The world needs it because Russia threatens the world with world hunger and the only way to solve this problem is to unblock the sea ports. 
""If we don't give farmers the opportunity to export their goods, for them there won't be any sense in going to the next growing season,"" she continued.
Another item on the agenda, was how to make use of assets affected by international sanctions, Ms Svyrydenko said. 
Ukraine made clear in March that it believed the assets belonging to Russian oligarchs and Russian central bank funds that have been frozen should be used to finance the rebuilding of Ukraine.  
""We should take them and [use] them for the reconstruction of Ukraine,"" she said. ""Otherwise what was the sense in freezing those assets, if no Ukrainian [would] receive them?"" 
""We just need to find a clear procedure for how to get these funds,"" Ms Svyrydenko said.
Everything from railways stations to factories would need to be rebuilt, she said. Ukraine has estimated the amount of money needed to rebuild the country at around $600bn.
Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU was examining how the frozen assets of Russian oligarchs could be used to pay for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the war."	/news/business-61548029
entertainment	I'm A Celebrity: Olivia Attwood heartbroken over early exit	"Olivia Attwood's team say she is ""heartbroken"" about having had to withdraw from I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! on medical grounds.
Love Island star has appeared in the first two episodes of this series, and was seen skydiving out of a helicopter on Sunday's launch show.
But on Monday, a show spokesman said Attwood had left after medics advised it was not safe for her to continue.
Her team later said fans will ""hear the truth from Olivia in due course"".
A message posted on her behalf to her Instagram page on Monday evening read: ""To say Olivia is heartbroken would be an understatement.
""She dreamed of doing 'I'm a Celeb' for years, and was absolutely loving every second of the show and throwing herself into jungle life feet first (just as we knew she would).
""However, for reasons beyond her control her journey has been cut short.""
V personality and model had entered the jungle alongside the likes of singer Boy George, DJ Chris Moyles and former England sports stars Mike Tindall and Jill Scott in the celebrity jungle on Sunday.
much-publicised arrival of former health secretary Matt Hancock as an extra campmate is expected later this week.
Addressing her two million followers directly, Attwood's team continued: ""Your support and kind words have meant the absolute world to her, now as much as it always has.
""You will hear the truth from Olivia in due course and she will be back on your screens in the New Year.""
Her exit means she has recorded the joint shortest stay in the show's 20-year history, alongside ex-EastEnders and Gimme Gimme Gimme actress Elaine Lordan.
Attwood was seen jumping out of a helicopter on Sunday's episode, while Monday's saw her take part in her first bushtucker trial. 
g-running ITV reality show enjoyed a bump in ratings for its new opening episode on Sunday, compared with 2021's opener in Wales.
An average audience of 9.1 million watched the programme, which returned to Australia for the first time in two years following the pandemic.
Last year's debut, set in a Welsh castle for the second year running, was seen by an average of 8.03m.
Before being made to do a tandem parachute jump out of a helicopter, Attwood was seen giving herself a little pep talk.
""This is a once in a lifetime opportunity,"" she said, jokingly adding: ""Just need to get back on safe ground in one piece, [with] both boobs, all the [dental] veneers, everything.""
After landing safely, she declared it to be ""the most amazing thing I've done ever.""
She had an auspicious start to her short time on the show, as she and Boy George were voted for by the public as jungle VIPs. But this turned out to mean Very Isolated Person, rather than Very Important Person.
""I am equal parts flattered and unnerved the public voted for me to be a VIP,"" she said, on discovering the news.
Attwood and Boy George were joined by their chosen guests, Moyles and TV presenter Scarlette Douglas, with the foursome having to stay marooned on an island outside the camp for their first night, which also turned out to be Attwood's last.
Attwood, who has also appeared on The Only Way Is Essex, last year fronted the documentary Getting Filthy Rich, exploring the world of people ""selling sex"" online.
31-year-old had previous experience of bush tucker trials, having appeared on I'm A Celebrity's spin-off show, Extra Camp, where she was made to eat sheep brains. 
But she exited the main show after taking part in just one trial, named HMS Drown Under, during which she was heard screaming while trying to quickly locate taps situated inside a series of ""hell holes"" in order to save her team from drowning.
At the start of Monday's episode, presenter Declan Donnelly explained to viewers: ""Unfortunately, Olivia Attwood has left the jungle for medical reasons and sadly won't be returning.""
""Now, she does feature in tonight's show, which was filmed before she had to leave,"" added his co-host Ant McPartlin. ""We're very sad to see her go and we wish her well.""
Ahead of the show, a spokesman confirmed Attwood's departure, stating: ""As a precautionary measure Olivia needed to leave the jungle to undergo some medical checks,"" a show spokesman told the BBC on Monday.
""Unfortunately, the medical team has advised it is not safe for Olivia to return to camp as there needs to be further investigation.
""She has been absolutely brilliant and she'll be very much missed on the show."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63541438
technology	People still booking Ubers in UK despite downturn	"Demand for Uber journeys in the UK is still strong, despite the soaring costs of living, the new boss of Uber UK has said.
Andrew Brem joined Uber UK in April.
Uber is looking to position itself as a ""super-app"" for travel - app users can now also book train and coach tickets and, in Liverpool, from rival taxi companies.
But Mr Brem ruled out an Uber railway takeover, saying the company was not interested in running a rail service.
""I don't see us driving trains or operating train companies or coaches,"" he said. 
""We will stick to making it super-simple for riders to do the end to-end journey.""
As the cost of living soared, Mr Brem said, more people may give up their own vehicles.
""It is going to be tough for people but I expect demand for movement to be fairly strong,"" he said.
""I haven't seen a reduction in demand for Uber rides yet,  
""I'm seeing quite strong demand. 
""And the strong demand tends to attract more people to come and drive on the platform.
""We have no plans to lay any anyone off at this moment. 
""Things are going fairly well."" 
re are currently more than 85,000 drivers on Uber's books and it operates in about 60 UK towns and cities. 
US-based technology company launched in the UK 10 years ago this month, immediately unleashing a storm of controversy. 
It was accused of trying to destroy the taxi sector, with its aggressively low fares, and has clashed several times over the years with workers' unions over driver rights - not just in the UK. 
For a long time, Uber argued its drivers were self-employed - but since March 2021, it has had to offer employee benefits, including minimum wage, sick pay and a pension.
And after years of being synonymous with ruthless disruption and disregard for rules and regulation, the company is really trying to rebrand itself as ""human"".
""On [the Uber] platform, you can actually talk to the person who's driving - and the driver can talk to the person riding,"" Mr Brem said.
""For me, that kind of intersection between digital and physical is really unique - and a massive positive to the job.""

sports	Winter Olympics: Cas rejects US skaters' request for silver medals before end of Games	"The Court of Arbitration for Sport has rejected an appeal by the United States' figure skaters who wanted to receive their silver medals during the Winter Olympics.
Russian Olympic Committee won the event but the medals have not been awarded because Kamila Valieva, 15, failed a drugs test.
Cas said it would release the reason for its decision in the coming days.
Beijing Games officially close on Sunday.
US team - consisting of Evan Bates, Karen Chen, Nathan Chen, Madison Chock, Zachary Donohue, Brandon Frazier, Madison Hubbell, Alexa Knierim and Vincent Zhou - finished second in the event on 7 February.
However, no medal ceremony has been held, with the athletes instead receiving teddy bears of the mascot Bing Dwen Dwen in a low-key event at the skating venue.
International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said a medal ceremony cannot be held until Valieva's case has been fully investigated.
US skaters, who wanted to go home with their medals, met IOC president Thomas Bach this week to discuss the issue.
IOC said it would not comment on an ongoing procedure.
It was announced on 8 February that Valieva had tested positive in December for angina drug trimetazidine.
She successfully appealed against a Russian Anti-Doping Agency decision to impose a provisional suspension.
Cas ruled that ""exceptional circumstances"" meant she should not be suspended. That allowed Valieva to compete in the women's single event, where she finished fourth."	/sport/winter-olympics/60446019
health	How play makes hospital less traumatic for children	"How play therapy helps children in hospital
Play is how children learn to navigate the world, create relationships, manage their emotions and cope with stressful situations.
re aren't many experiences more stressful than being ill and receiving treatment in hospital yet many do not offer much in the way of play, despite this being a government requirement.
Why is it so important?
Like many six-year-olds, Afonso is focused on building a toy track. Unlike many of his peers, he's trying to construct it in a hospital.  
When he was three, he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a treatable cancer which demands hospital visits for treatments such as chemotherapy as well as lots of blood tests.
""I remember the first period of treatment, which was horrendous,"" his mother, Susana Casanova, recalls.
When he was having his first cannula - a tube which administers treatments - inserted, Susana remembers holding him as he was telling her: ""Mummy, how do you allow them to hurt me so much?"" 
Now, a couple of years and many treatments later, he is not fazed.
""He is not traumatised by the word 'hospital', or doctors or nurses or procedures or lumbar punctures. He's not scared of that,"" Susana says. ""Last year in school, he made a show and tell of going in an ambulance.""
She believes the difference is down to play specialists, experts who entertain Afonso and play with him to support him through his treatments.
""The play is really amazing and it makes children forget they are in the hospital; the playmates put children in their natural environment,"" Susana says.
Julie Morris, one of Afonso's ""playmates"" at Kingston Hospital in south-west London, says it ""involves creating an environment for children that's not clinical"".  
""They (children) often ask for one of us to be with them when they have a scan or a blood test. It makes them feel a little bit more reassured, having somebody there. 
""Sometimes they even look forward to coming in to see us and play in the playroom as well, which is nice.
""We can distract them when they have procedures, we can explain about the procedures - we're with them the whole time."" 
For Afonso's mother, the specialists weren't just there for her son, but her as well.
""Twenty-four hours in hospital, it's too intense,"" she says.
""They've always been super-protective, providing the coffee when I needed, playing with him so I could have a shower to keep going.
""They come and help us in every way they can, making them feel happy and that's the main thing that we want, to see our son happy, and be taken care of.""
One mother, who recently spent more than 20 hours in A&E with her one-year-old, described it as a really tough experience as no play options were available.
""When children go into hospital, they're traumatised, they're afraid, they're anxious, and play is the natural choice for children to feel back in control,"" says Cathy Gilman, chief executive of Starlight Children's Foundation, a charity which provides toys to hospitals.
""It's so important a child isn't lonely or bored in hospital because that's a dangerous place where your mind and your imagination run riot.""
Play specialists can also help children process difficult emotions. 
Children tend to ""puddle jump"" with their feelings - one minute they can be very sad, the next singing and dancing - says play therapist Donna Ellis. 
rd for children, especially if they think their actions are affecting their parents.
""They're very influenced by the mood and the atmosphere around them,"" she says.
""If children start to think they can't talk about things or notice that it's upsetting adults, they can then learn they've got to adapt their own behaviours.
""As adults, we're quite guilty of persuading children out of feeling states. When they're upset, we'll say 'oh, cheer up, never mind' or 'it's OK'.
""Feelings come and go. If you talk with children about feelings being like waves, and the wave comes, it feels a bit bumpy or a bit scary or a bit rocky, but the seas move over.""
One of the benefits of having a play specialist or therapist on hand is that they do not have the same emotional investment in a child as the parents.
""Although I am emotionally connected to them, they're not my children, so we can have difficult conversations, children can say things to me,"" adds Ms Ellis.
It's a service not available to every child.
According to the National Association of Healthcare Specialists, 80% of hospitals say their play services are limited.
Many have not recovered the service they offered before the pandemic when play areas were closed for infection control and play specialists were redeployed. 
But even before the pandemic, access to play support was far from universal, according to Ms Gilman, who says 80% of hospitals that use Starlight's services have no budget for play and, of those that do, it's less than £500 a year. 
In 2004, the government's national framework for children, young people and maternity services set out a requirement for play services to be available in all hospital settings, citing research that showed play ""hastened recovery, as well as reduced the need for interventions to be delivered under general anaesthesia"".
In a statement, the NHS said it recognised the importance of children's play services and was working closely with the Starlight Children's Foundation on increasing their availability.
""We have introduced a new taskforce and will be creating guidance for local areas to help them increase access and improve the quality of these services across hospitals in England, in line with NICE guidance,"" it added.
One service Starlight offers is boxes containing toys and other things for children to play with. Each one costs about £100 and can support 60 children. 
rity is also running a Christmas appeal, called Play Loneliness Away, to raise £400,000 to make sure children have access to toys and technology such as computer consoles.
Although NHS budgets are stretched, play can help make treatments go more smoothly which helps nurses and saves money in the long run, Ms Gilman says.
""If a child is less distressed then they can be treated more easily. So that preparation before with play, distraction during treatment and when you're bored afterwards is really important.""
Claire Russell, early years expert and founder of PlayHOORAY!
Play can offer an amazing insight into how your child thinks and feels. When a child is processing complex emotional issues, it can very often show up in their play. 
For example, if a child hears adults arguing, they may recreate this conflict with their teddies. 
Make-believe play can help prepare children for the unknown and ease worry and anxiety in the process.
As children get older their play changes so then it is about finding new ways to ""play"". 
Dancing or singing loudly can be seen as play too. Research shows these activities will get the endorphins going, which can actually reduce stress levels and be a factor in warding off anxiety and depression. 
It's important that people know that they don't need to spend money on toys or equipment to entertain a child - I promise you can have just as much fun with everyday items around the house. 
Spending time with your child and being silly with them, whatever their age, will remind them they are valued and loved, and laughing together is a wonderful medicine.

entertainment	Donna Langley, the British film executive who wants to send Tom Cruise to space	"Donna Langley is a woman with big plans, not least to send Tom Cruise into space.
As the chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group, she's the first British woman to run a major American film studio.
It makes her one of the most powerful people in Hollywood. Not bad for a Brit from the Isle of Wight who arrived in Los Angeles in her early 20s with no contacts in the movie business at all.
rty years on - and now a Dame - Langley tells me she still feels ""culturally very English, even though my accent slips in and out a bit"".  
She does sound more transatlantic than Isle of Wight, but as we ride together on the back of a golf cart around the Universal lot, she assures me: ""I still like my Marmite sandwiches and a good packet of crisps.""
Langley has turned Universal's fortunes around, and has been steering the oldest surviving US film studio through the difficulties of a pandemic as well as the rise of the streaming platforms.  
She is impressive and down to earth - but the project Universal is developing with Cruise is literally out of this world.
BBC's Katie Razzall spoke to Donna Langley at Universal in LA
Langley tells BBC News that Cruise plans to take a rocket up to the International Space Station. The movie plot, which Cruise and director Doug Liman pitched to her on Zoom during the pandemic, ""actually takes place on earth, and then the character needs to go up to space to save the day"".
, she adds, is that Cruise will be ""the first civilian to do a spacewalk outside of the space station"".
For Universal, the space film is clearly still an aspiration at this stage.
More definite is the slate of 44 movies announced for release in 2022/23 as the industry tries to get back to pre-Covid levels.  
re will be the lucrative franchise stalwarts (among them another Trolls movie; the 10th Fast and Furious, shot in the UK; and then Despicable Me 4 in 2024). But there's creative range too.  
Langley's wooed Steven Spielberg back to the studio where he made Jaws and ET. The Fabelmans has just premiered at the Toronto Film Festival. Christopher Nolan will release his next movie Oppenheimer with Universal after he dumped Warner Bros for Langley.
forthcoming She Said stars Carey Mulligan as one of the journalists who broke the Harvey Weinstein scandal.  
Picking which movie pitches will fly is ""gut instinct"", she tells me in a lengthy interview for BBC Radio 4's The Media Show. Rather than rationalising decisions through a business model lens, it's about ""feeling the story on a very human level"", she says.
Her USP in part comes from learning early in her career to ""make films that were aimed at a specific audience"", often people traditionally ignored by Hollywood.  She found that movies appealing to women or people of colour, for example, were ""good business. The amount of money [the films] make is relative to what they cost, so they're hugely profitable.""
She championed Straight Outta Compton, the movie charting the rise of hip-hop group NWA, which took $201m at the box office worldwide.
Famously, she fought for Mamma Mia when others weren't keen. The movie, based on Abba's back catalogue, was a smash hit, with global takings of $600m.
""They are films that I didn't see as inherently risky. It's easy for me to sit here with you today and say that, when the proof is in the pudding.""
But for Langley, there's a common thread to that success, even if others didn't see it. They were universal stories audiences could relate to.
Phyllida Lloyd, Mamma Mia's director, praises Langley's ""clarity and calm"".  She told me the Universal executive had ""a business-like approach. She really did not sweat the small stuff.""
Sharon Waxman, editor in chief of The Wrap, one of Hollywood's most influential publications, describes Langley as ""hugely respected"".  Of course not everything is a hit and Waxman points to the disappointing opening weekend for Bros, Universal's gay romcom. They are the first major studio to make a movie of this kind. 
But she credits her with taking risks.  She Said, for example, ""is not a movie that every studio would decide to green light"".
Storytelling (and Abba), Langley says, were a big part of her childhood on the Isle of Wight. Her biological father was Egyptian and she was adopted as a baby. Her mum was an activist (""she had me shaking a can on behalf of Greenpeace or CND on the local high street""), while her dad worked for the Civil Aviation Authority.
Going to the cinema wasn't a common family event, although she remembers her sister taking her to see an Abba concert movie in the 1970s (which was ""90 minutes of heaven, I was so happy""). Instead, the family read widely, and perhaps that drew her to film.  
""As Brits, we grow up with a deep love of literature,"" she says. Free to roam on the Isle of Wight, ""my imagination would run wild with the history of the place, whether it was smugglers or aristocracy"".
On the island, her heritage meant she was viewed, she says archly, as ""exotic"", adding: ""It gave me a sense of independence."" She says she was ""bullied a little bit"" in school and found humour was a way to deflect the ""tougher moments"". 
So how did that kid make it so big in Tinseltown? Langley told me she ""didn't see a future"" for herself in the UK of the early 90s though she ""had no idea I was going to work in film"".  She admits ""I do have moments when I look back and think how did it all happen?""
Langley was just 22 when she arrived in LA with a letter of introduction to a literary agent, planning to stay just a few months.  But she was ""bitten by the bug"" and ""it became obvious I needed to stay"".  She found the US ""less restrictive,"" telling me that whereas Britain was very hierarchical, in America ""if you have an idea, a work ethic, you can make it"".
She got her first break while working in a nightclub on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard. One of the regulars hired her at New Line Cinema. 
She credits her success to ""a bit of delusional self-belief"" and a lot of hard work, though the Hollywood of the time wasn't ""for the faint of heart, you had to have some chutzpah"". 
Langley is committed to British film-making. Universal's Jurassic World Dominion, shot at Pinewood Studios, was the first Hollywood blockbuster to resume filming during the pandemic, and they'll soon start production on Wicked in the UK. 
Ben Roberts, CEO of the BFI, told me she is ""one of the most successful British executives in the business - and we're delighted that Universal have decided to base so many of their productions here in the UK"".
With the future of cinema still in the balance, Langley accepts that streaming movies at home is here to stay. She earned the fury of cinema chains when she decided during the pandemic to put Universal's new Trolls movie straight on to a streaming platform. She says it was a ""watershed moment"". It certainly severed the tradition of big movies going first into cinemas.
Waxman believes Langley's biggest challenges now are ""to refill the pipeline of Universal with the kinds of blockbusters, like the Fast and Furious franchise, that will drive billion dollar global hits"".
For Langley, the ""$100bn question"" is what will entice audiences back into cinemas. She accepts they're ""the domain of the big visual effects movies… but what else?""
While ""the bar is getting higher"" on the kinds of movies people will leave their home to watch, she has a use-it-or-lose-it message. 
""To make movies matter, to make them connect with the cultural zeitgeist, to create movie stars and to create directors and careers, it really does need that theatrical experience,"" she says.

urnip Prize went to ""Cue Jumpers"" - two tiny sweaters on a snooker cue - by an artist known as Lie Instate.  
Morning presenters were caught in a media storm amid claims they failed to queue to pay respects to the late monarch.
rganised by a Somerset pub and pokes fun at the Turner Prize.
It was launched in 1999 in response to Tracey Emin's unmade bed, which was exhibited at the Tate gallery that year.
Recipients are tasked with creating something ""they perceive to be crap art using the least amount of effort possible"".
Lie Instate, a cinema projectionist from London, joked Gordon the Gopher - Schofield's puppet sidekick from his time as a children's television presenter in the 1990s - lent him the jumpers for his ""masterpiece"". 
Accepting his award, a turnip attached to a wooden base, the artist said: ""It was while visiting Gordon the Gopher in rehab that I first had the idea of bringing Phillip Schofield down through the power of art.
""Gordon kindly lent me two of his jumpers for the piece and at that point I knew it was in the can.
""It's a great honour and I am reeling with delight to win this prestigious award - I can now feed my five children this Christmas.""
r's Turnip Prize attracted 69 entries.
Organiser Trevor Prideaux said: ""It's fantastic that Lie Instate has won, he clearly has what it takes to be recognised in modern art circles and will be remembered in art history for no time at all.""
four finalists' work will be on show at the New Inn, in Wedmore, until Friday.
Mr Prideaux added: ""All entries still at the pub after Friday 9 December will be thrown in the skip.""

business	Faisal Islam: Veiled concern about Trussonomics at IMF	"British economic policy faced some thinly-veiled criticism by other G7 finance ministers at the crucial meeting of major economies at the IMF yesterday, the BBC understands.
While the UK was not identified by name, multiple participants at the round table, the debut of UK Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, raised their concerns about countries making unfunded tax cuts that threatened financial stability, at a delicate time, a clear reference to Britain.
One G7 minister said privately that the concern was really about how the UK had ""doubled down"" even after the clear financial stability implication, and that explanations would be sought.
US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had already said publicly on the sidelines of the IMF conference that she was ""watching UK developments closely"".
While she didn't want to comment on UK policy, she said: ""I am going to try to understand what the impact of those policies and their rationale is.""
Secretary Yellen, a former Federal Reserve Chair told CNBC when asked if UK fiscal credibility problems were making global markets more volatile said ""at a time when monetary policy is tightening, fiscal policy should have a stance that complements that that central banks play the lead, but fiscal policy should be complementary. We've tried to do that in the United States.""
President of the Eurogroup, which represents the Eurozone, the Irish Finance minister Paschal Donohoe, told the BBC: ""The United Kingdom is a G7 economy with their own currency. 
""And it's absolutely obvious in all of the public statements that have been made by the Bank of England and by the government of the United Kingdom, that they're aware of developments that are taking place and have every confidence in their ability to be able to manage these kinds of developments.""
But he stressed that Ireland had taken a ""different approach"" by deciding ""not to borrow"" to fund energy crisis help, because he wanted to make sure it was affordable and ""the need to ensure financial market confidence"".
former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, when asked about the message being sent by markets to the UK, said, ""whether it's in monetary policy or fiscal policy, or climate policy, credibility comes from commitment, clear commitment, it comes from transparency, and it's buttressed by institutions"". 
Mr Carney said he had ""full confidence in the Bank of England"" to get inflation back down and to safeguard the financial system and ""as a consequence of both of those, markets will settle and they will price risk accordingly. And I'm sure the government is aware of that and working to ensure that it has the right budget policy""."	/news/business-63238028

business	Minimum wage should rise to £15 for all workers, says TUC	"minimum wage in the UK should rise to £15 an hour ""as soon as possible"", the Trades Union Congress (TUC) says.
rate should apply to workers of all ages, instead of the current lower rate for under-23s, it said.
Minimum wage is £9.50 an hour for workers over the age of 23 and £9.18 for 21 and 22 year olds. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at 10.1% - so wages do not go as far.
government said raising the minimum wage could push unemployment up.
Prices are rising at their fastest rate in 40 years, driven by higher food, fuel and energy costs. 
Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: ""Every worker should be able to afford a decent standard of living.
""But millions of low-paid workers live wage packet to wage packet, struggling to get by - and they are now being pushed to the brink by eye-watering bills and soaring prices.""
government said it was ""determined to make work pay"" and that this year's increase in the minimum wage, in April, was the largest ever rise. However, it said setting the minimum wage too high or increasing it too quickly could lead to higher unemployment. 
UC argues that at a time when companies are paying increased dividends to shareholders, the government should ensure workers get ""their fair share"" by increasing minimum wage rates now, rather than waiting for the next expected uprating in April.
It should start with low-paid workers who are ""absolutely terrified about what those hikes in energy bills will mean for their budgets, having to fork out for school uniforms and put food on the table"", Ms O'Grady told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
She said a higher minimum wage would mean workers were less likely to be claiming in-work benefits, and more likely to be paying taxes as well as buying goods and services on the High Street. 
Kelly, 31, works front of house in a well-known London restaurant and despite eight years of experience in the sector is paid the minimum wage. Her income is topped up with tips and her partner has a  salary, but she has still seen a decline in her quality of life over the past decade.
""We are constantly in a precarious position, living hand-to-mouth,"" she said. ""[We're] being squeezed further and further.""
But Mark Hodges, 66, who runs a clubhouse restaurant on a holiday park in Norfolk, said raising the minimum wage to £15 an hour would mean restaurants would have to raise prices. 
""Although it would be fantastic to see us all move to £15 an hour, I cannot see how such a large rise - across all ages - would do our sector many favours,"" he said.
""If somebody said let's move to £15 an hour by 2027 so the industry had plenty of time to plan and adjust, then maybe it's achievable,"" he told the BBC, but he wouldn't like to see the minimum wage go up immediately at a time when everything else is rocketing in price.
And giving the same minimum wage across the board, would mean older workers applying for jobs that are currently given to younger, less experienced workers.
""The people who would suffer would be young ones,"" he added.
Before the minimum wage was first introduced in 1999 some economists warned it could lead to job losses because firms would hire fewer people. But there has been no evidence of overall job losses linked to the minimum wage.
UC said the evidence from around the world suggested higher minimum wages led to higher wages overall, rather than job losses.
re was no justification for paying lower rates to younger workers, Ms O'Grady added.  Workers aged 18 to 20 are paid a minimum of £6.83 an hour.
""It's clear to me, and I think to many people, that people ought to be paid the rate for the job, regardless of the age they are,"" Ms O'Grady said. 
""If they're working as hard doing the same job, why should they be discriminated against simply because they're under 23?""
However, Matthew Percival, director of skills and inclusion at the CBI, which represents businesses, said there should not be a new target for the minimum wage and that any rise in its rate should be rooted in growth and higher productivity across the economy.
""Firms are increasing wages where they can, but energy price rises are pushing some to the brink. High energy prices require urgent government action to support households and businesses, not relying on the minimum wage alone,"" he said. 
minimum wage is set in relation to the median wage - an average calculated by taking every pay packet in the UK and identifying the mid-point. The current target is for the minimum wage to reach 66% of median wages by 2024. The TUC argues wages should rise for all workers to an average of £20 an hour and that the minimum wage target should be 75% of that."	/news/business-62656500

business	China signals it could miss economic growth target	"China has signalled that it may miss its annual economic growth target, as Covid restrictions weigh on the world's second largest economy.
On Thursday, the Politburo - the ruling Communist Party's top policy-making body - said it aims to keep growth within ""a reasonable range"".
It did not mention the official growth target of 5.5% it had earlier set. 
China is continuing to pursue a zero-Covid policy that has put major cities into full or partial lockdowns.
In a statement after its quarterly economic meeting, the 25-member Politburo, which is chaired by President Xi Jinping, said leaders would ""strive to achieve the best results possible"". 
However, it also called on stronger provinces to work to meet their growth targets. 
Analysts said the lack of a GDP mention was notable, though economists had earlier predicted it would be difficult for China to reach its 5.5% target. 
""The 5.5% growth target is no longer a must for China,"" Iris Pang, chief China economist at ING Bank, had told news outlet the Wall Street Journal. 
China was urging larger provinces to make up for those that were more affected by the lockdown. 
""Beijing requested that provinces which are relatively well-positioned should strive to achieve economic and social targets for this year,"" Nomura analysts Ting Lu, Jing Wang and Harrington Zhang said in a note.
""We think Beijing is suggesting that GDP growth targets for provinces with less favourable conditions, especially for those that were hard hit by the Omicron variant and lockdowns, could be more flexible.""
Earlier this month, China said its economy had contracted sharply in the second quarter of this year.
Large Chinese cities, including the major financial and manufacturing hub of Shanghai, were put into full or partial lockdowns during this period.
China's once-booming property market is also in a deep slump, and home sales have fallen for 11 consecutive months.
Several Chinese developers have halted the construction of homes that had already been sold, because of concerns over cash flow.
In recent weeks, some home buyers have threatened to stop paying their mortgages until the work restarts.
In 2020, China made the rare decision to scrap its GDP targets, in light of the pandemic. 
GDP measures the size of an economy. Gauging its expansion or contraction is one of the most important ways of measuring how well or badly an economy is performing and is closely watched by economists and central banks.
It also helps businesses to judge when to expand and recruit more workers or invest less and cut their workforces.

While it is too early to say that cases of strep A have peaked in Northern Ireland, there is some reassurance in the fact that, this week, the number of children attending the Royal Victoria Hospital's emergency department is down.
Belfast Health Trust said the still-relatively high number does not reflect strep A or scarlet fever. 
While wards are described as being busy, it is understood that children are being treated for a range of infections, with strep A cases in low numbers.
In a statement on the supply of antibiotics, the Department of Health said: ""While demand is well in excess of what is usual for this time of year, the system has been working hard to replenish stocks as quickly as possible.
""Wholesalers are carefully managing the volumes available to them to ensure that supplies are available to those in greatest need.""
rtment added that the surge in demand is being seen across the UK and that the supply chain ""has responded positively... with suppliers increasing manufacturing capacity and fast-tracking delivery of ingredients required for production"".
On Monday, the department said that deliveries of antibiotics to treat strep A were being sped up to reach wholesalers and pharmacies in the coming days.
Most strep A infections are mild - a sore throat or a skin infection that can be easily treated with antibiotics.
But some people who catch it can get very sick.
As of last Thursday, 15 children had died across the UK following invasive strep A infections since September.

technology	Medibank: Hackers release abortion data after stealing Australian medical records	"Hackers who stole customer data from Australia's largest health insurer Medibank have released a file of pregnancy terminations.
It follows Medibank's refusal to pay a ransom for the data, supported by the Australian government.
Medibank urged the public to not seek out the files, which contain the names of policy holders rather than patients.
CEO David Koczkaro warned that the data release could stop people from seeking medical attention.
rminations can occur for a range of reasons including non-viable pregnancy, miscarriages and complications.
""These are real people behind this data and the misuse of their data is deplorable and may discourage them from seeking medical care,"" he said.
f 9.7 million Medibank customers was stolen last month - the latest in a string of major data breaches in Australian companies in recent months. 
kers this week published their first tranche of information after Medibank refused to pay a $10m (£8.7m; A$15.6m) ransom - about $1 for every customer.
Some Australians say they have been targeted by scammers after their medical details were posted online.
Former tennis champion Todd Woodbridge - who is recovering from a heart attack - said he had been pestered by calls from scammers who had known which hospital he had been in.
""I think I'm one of those people that have been scammed by the Medibank situation, I'm a customer of theirs,"" he told Melbourne radio station 3AW on Wednesday.
He and others have criticised Medibank for the security breach.
Earlier this week the hackers released a set of customer detail files named ""good-list"" and ""naughty-list"". 
files included people's health claims data - including medical procedure history -  as well as names, addresses, birthdates and government ID numbers.
ursday, the hackers on their forum added they had also: ""added one more file abortions.csv..."". 
Medibank has apologised for what it has called the ""malicious weaponisation"" of private information. The hackers got the information after login details allowing access to all its customer data was stolen.
Australian government has also defended the company's decision to not pay the ransom.
Both have warned that more releases of customer information are expected. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said that he is also Medibank customer.
In September, Australia's second-largest telecommunications firm Optus was also targeted for extortion, after the personal data of about 10 million customers was stolen in what the company called a cyber-attack.
Several Australians have identified themselves as being affected by both breaches.
Medibank data has been posted on a blog linked to Russian ransomware group REvil, local media have reported."	/news/world-australia-63579985
technology	Security warning after sale of stolen Chinese data	"President Xi Jinping has urged public bodies to ""defend information security"" after a hacker offered to sell stolen data of one billion Chinese citizens.
In an advert on a criminal forum, later removed, the user said the data was stolen from Shanghai National Police.
ker claims the information includes names, addresses, National ID numbers and mobile phone numbers. 
Cyber-security experts have verified that at least some of a small sample of the data offered is real.
23 terabytes of data is thought to be the largest ever sale of data on record and was being offered for $200,000 (£166,000) until the post was removed on Friday.
No Chinese officials have responded to the news and President Xi did not make direct reference to the data sale.
But, according to the South China Morning Post, the president has asked public bodies in China to ""defend information security… to protect personal information, privacy and confidential corporate information"" to ensure people feel secure when submitting data for public services.
On Friday, the moderators of the website where the sale was listed - by a user called ChinaDan - posted a notice which read: ""Dear Chinese users, welcome to our forum. You most likely came here because of the Shanghai police database leak. The data is no longer being sold, and posts related to this topic have been deleted.""
website administrators then added that they have many other similar and high quality Chinese databases for sale, adding: ""We are not in China and we are not Chinese, so we do not have to obey Chinese laws.""
According to DarkTracer, which monitors cyber criminal activity, another hacker - perhaps inspired by the publicity surrounding ChinaDan's offer - posted an advert on Tuesday for 90 million Chinese citizen records, which the hacker claims to have stolen from Henan National Police (HNGA). None of that data has been verified.
""It remains unclear exactly why the data has been withdrawn,"" Toby Lewis, global head of threat analysis at Darktrace said. 
""The original offer of sale suggests that the hacker was looking to sell the data to several buyers without exclusivity, rather than just one. 
""So one theory is that for a high enough price exclusivity could have been bought, and that kind of purchase could possibly have been made by the Chinese state itself.""
Mr Lewis believes the leaked information could have been a major concern for Chinese authorities which reportedly blocked discussions of the sale on Chinese social networks shortly after it was advertised.
Deb Leary, CEO of Forensic Pathways, also believes the data may have been sold to a high bidder, but adds: ""It's interesting, and not unexpected, that the hacker forum used the incident as a way to promote themselves as a go-to place for stolen data. 
""They don't seem to be worried about angering the Chinese authorities.""
In April a popular hacking website called Raid Forums was seized and shut down in an international police operation led by the FBI. 
's Portuguese founder, and a British man based in Croydon, were arrested.
Large data sets such as the Chinese cache can be used by hackers to send impersonation emails and other malicious attacks to trick people into handing over cash to criminals.
But now the data has disappeared it may never be possible to verify it.
Another theory is that the data and ChinaDan could have been discovered to be fake by the website administrators.
However Louise Ferrett, Threat Analyst at Searchlight Security, thinks the data could well be genuine.
""There are indications that the data on sale was legitimate. Firstly, the source of the data has been reported by some security teams as human error on the part of a government developer,"" she said.
""Secondly, multiple sources have confirmed that the sample data that the seller, known as ChinaDan, provided was legitimate. 
""This doesn't necessarily mean the entire database was real but these two elements combined do certainly make it more likely,"" said Mrs Ferrett. "	/news/technology-62097594
sports	Serena Williams: 'Almost the end of an era' with American icon set to retire	"It is almost the end of an era.
Serena Williams, the 23-time Grand Slam singles champion, one of the greatest tennis players of all time and a sporting icon, is set to retire.
It is difficult to imagine tennis without the American legend, who has won all there is to win during her 27-year career.
From a purely sporting point of view, Williams will be remembered as one of the game's greatest competitors, an athlete who possessed the purest serve in the women's game and a never-fading desire to win.
She will also be remembered for speaking out against racism, pushing for gender parity and equal prize money, and about her experiences of the healthcare system as a black woman.
World number 11 Coco Gauff, 18, said Williams was ""the reason why I play tennis"" and her legacy can ""inspire many more generations"", while British number one Emma Raducanu, 19, said she ""changed the game"".
""Tennis being a predominantly white sport it definitely helped a lot,"" said Gauff. ""Because I saw somebody who looked like me dominating the game. It made me believe that I could dominate too.""
Here, BBC Sport looks at the big moments from an iconic career.
Aged just 17, Williams produced a fine run to lift her first Grand Slam singles title in New York. She beat world number four Monica Seles in the quarter-finals, then second-ranked Lindsey Davenport before meeting world number one Martina Hingis in the final. 
Williams claimed a straight-set victory to become the first African-American woman in the Open Era to win a singles major. Just for good measure, she and Venus then won the doubles title together in the same weekend.
Both Williams sisters have spoken about the racism they experienced throughout their career in a traditionally white sport and the issues their father, Richard, faced.
rs were set to meet in the semi-finals of Indian Wells - one of the biggest events outside of the Grand Slams - in 2001. However, when Venus withdrew with injury, accusations of match-fixing were pointed towards Richard and the sisters. Serena was then heavily booed when she came out to play Kim Clijsters in the final, and both Richard and Venus said they were racially abused by the crowd.
Serena won and instantly hugged her father in the stands. She and Venus then boycotted the event for many years, with Serena not returning until 2015 and Venus a year later.
Williams arrived in Melbourne on the back of an amazing Grand Slam streak, having won every major since the 2002 French Open. Only the Australian Open trophy was absent from her cabinet.
She had to do it the hard way in Melbourne, saving two match points and overturning a 5-1 third set deficit against Kim Clijsters in the semi-finals to reach the final. She then beat Venus for her fourth consecutive major singles triumph. It also secured a career Grand Slam and a non-calendar year Grand Slam for Williams at just 22 years old.
Williams' triumphs on the Wimbledon grass were the start of a resurgent few years that saw her win another nine major singles titles.
She followed up her Wimbledon title run with a dominant performance to claim Olympic singles gold. Williams thrashed Maria Sharapova 6-0 6-1 in just 62 minutes on the same court where Sharapova had so memorably beaten her in 2004. It was the heaviest defeat for Sharapova against Williams, with the American winning 22 of their 24 meetings over 15 years.
Williams started and ended the 2015 season as world number one, winning the Australian Open, Roland Garros and Wimbledon to go with her 2014 US Open title and secure yet another 'Serena Slam'.
She was on course for the calendar Grand Slam in New York and faced Italy's Roberta Vinci in the semi-finals, who she had beat four times in a row. She won the first set and led 2-0 in the decider before the unseeded Italian came back to stun Williams and the crowd. Williams later described the loss as one that broke her heart.
Williams found out she was expecting her first child shortly before the first Grand Slam of the year. At eight weeks pregnant she clinched her eighth Australian Open title and passed Steffi Graf in the all-time list of major winners in the Open Era, with only Margaret Court ahead of her. 
She did not drop a set in Melbourne and, to underline her dominance, returned to the top of the world rankings before going on maternity leave.
Williams has spoken extensively about the struggles black women in the United States experience in healthcare, particularly in regards to complications in pregnancy or childbirth. Williams herself almost died after giving birth to Olympia because of an embolism.
She made her Grand Slam return at Roland Garros eight months after giving birth and wore a black catsuit which, as well as making her feel like 'a queen from Wakanda', helped her cope with blood clots. Two months later, she would reach the Wimbledon final, where she lost to Angelique Kerber.
Williams said several times that breaking Court's record was ""the only reason"" she still played following her daughter's birth and it seemed fitting that she could equal it on her home turf after reaching the US Open final.
Williams was the heavy favourite against maiden finalist Naomi Osaka. However, Williams' outburst at umpire Carlos Ramos, where she called him a liar and thief after being docked three points, divided opinion and led to a hostile New York crowd. Osaka triumphed but both players were in tears by the end.
With rumours swirling of retirement, it felt cruel that the last time Wimbledon would see the American great would be when she limped off in tears in the first round in 2021 after injuring her ankle.
However, her surprise decision to compete in singles through a wildcard led to a late-night thriller against France's Harmony Tan. Williams thrilled the crowd and showed all her competitiveness before going down in three sets.
As she left to a standing ovation, she stood and twirled one last time on the stage that has brought her and the fans so much joy over the years.

health	Calls for mental health support for unpaid carers	"A woman who became a full-time carer to her husband after he became paralysed has said that mental health is ""a big problem"" among unpaid carers.
Nicky Probert-Thompson, 59, from Swindon, worked as a catering manager until her husband, Mick, 75, had a stroke in 2014, just 14 months after retiring from a military career.
She is calling for mental health support to be more accessible.
""Until you care for someone, you don't realise how lonely it is,"" she said.
After suffering a stroke, Mick was left paralysed down his left side and Ms Probert-Thompson said their situation had become more difficult since the pandemic.
""Before retiring, Mick's role in the RAF allowed him to travel the world. Getting out and about, as well as catching up with life-long friends was so important to us,"" she said.
""But with the pandemic, it has been harder. I am still worried about contracting Covid-19 because if I passed it onto him he would be seriously ill.
""It has been quite isolating for us, and not being able to interact with other people has really affected my mental health,"" added Ms Probert-Thompson.
She has received support from Swindon Carers Centre which has provided welfare and benefit advice and organised social events with other carers.
Ms Probert-Thompson said the charity, which supports more than 21,000 unpaid carers, had been ""an absolute lifeline"".
It will soon be able to offer further support after being awarded £40,000 to employ a specialist mental health practitioner.
grant, from RUHX (the official charity of the Royal United Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust) and NHS Charities Together, will fund the position for two years.
Stuart Ilbury, head of service delivery at Swindon Carers Centre, said the people it supports are reporting increased anxiety, stress, depression and loneliness following the pandemic
""Some unpaid carers are near crisis point. They feel like they can't go on - they also feel guilty for thinking this.
""The new practitioner will be helping carers with concerns or issues they have and identifying their mental health needs and what support may be needed,"" added Mr Ilbury.
Ms Probert-Thompson said that mental health support is ""absolutely vital for unpaid carers"".
""I need the opportunity to talk confidentially about my feelings, with someone who can understand my situation but remains separate from it.
""Unpaid carers often feel forgotten but this support makes our hard work and bravery feel that little bit more recognised,"" she added.

technology	Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner share Instagram criticism	"Reality TV stars Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner have joined Instagram content creators in criticising the platform's new design.
Ms Kardashian and Ms Jenner shared posts on their Instagram Stories asking the Meta-owned platform to ""make Instagram Instagram again"".
Instagram has recently shifted its focus from individual posts to its own short video format Reels.
But some users are telling Instagram to ""stop trying to be TikTok"".
Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri admitted in a Reel on Tuesday that there has been ""a lot of change all at once"" on the platform.
While reassuring viewers photos will stay on Instagram as ""part of our heritage"", he said he believes Instagram will become more video-based over time.
Instagram will need ""to lean into that shift"" of what people like, consume, share and view on Instagram to video - while still supporting photos, he added. 
He noted that other features causing concern for creators, such as a full-screen mode, recommendations and visibility of friends' posts, will be subject to further improvement.
""We're going to stay in a place where we try and put your friends' content at the top of feeds and in front of stories whenever possible,"" he said. 
""But we're also going to need to evolve because the world is changing quickly. And we're going to have to change along with it.""
form announced new tools for creators using its Reels feature on 21 July, letting them ""Remix"" previous public photo posts as Reels and simultaneously film and react to content on front and back cameras with a ""Dual"" feature.
Instagram also revealed that new videos which are less than 15 minutes long will be automatically uploaded as Reels in coming weeks.
In 2018 shares of social media company Snap tumbled after Ms Jenner tweeted about her reluctance to use Snapchat, to her 24.5million Twitter followers. 
Her tweet followed a controversial Snapchat re-design in response to increased competition from alternative social media platforms. 
After referring to Snapchat as her ""first love"" in a follow-up tweet, Ms Jenner helped to accelerate a drastic share slide for Snap which wiped $1.3bn (£1bn) off the company's stock in a day.  
At the time of writing, Ms Jenner has 360million followers on Instagram and Ms Kardashian has 325million.
Both shared a post to their followers on Monday which said ""Make Instagram Instagram again"" and in brackets added ""stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends"". 
Ms Kardashian added ""pretty please"" when sharing this on her Story, while Ms Jenner seconded this by adding ""pleaseeeeeee"" on her own. 
riginal post, uploaded as a meme by 21-year-old photographer and content creator Tati Bruening, has now been shared across Instagram and made its way onto other social platforms like Twitter.
Ms Bruening says she was scrolling through Instagram last week when she noticed her friends' photos missing from her feed.
""I was getting quite frustrated, so half-jokingly made a meme about it and posted it,"" she said. 
She added that while the post just came from a place of ""momentary frustration"", it's not surprising that it ""started getting shared around the photography community and expanded from there"".
""I'm all for the app evolving and adding features like Reels,"" she said, but added there is a ""stark difference"" between what sort of content used to be visible on Instagram feeds and now. 
She says this left many who grew their platform as photographers on Instagram wondering ""how they're going to further their platform on an app that no longer favours the content that they create"".
Ms Bruening's petition, calling on Instagram to bring back chronological timelines and ""an algorithm which favours photos"" now has more than 140,000 signatures.
""We just want to see when our friends post,"" the petition states. ""The beauty of Instagram was that it was INSTAntaneous.""

health	'NHS is broken' say striking ambulance staff in West	"Ambulance workers in the West are striking in a dispute over pay and working conditions.
Picket lines have formed in Bristol, Somerset, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire on Wednesday.
Disruption is expected to be extensive and NHS leaders have warned that patient safety is at risk.
Ambulances will be responding to life-threatening situations but people are asked to only call 999 in life-threatening situations.
Paramedics, control room staff and support workers, who are members of the Unison, GMB and Unite unions, are striking across much of England and Wales.
Unions representing ambulance workers want pay increases to keep up with the rising cost of living. They have not set a specific figure but argue any offer needs to be high enough to prevent a recruitment crisis.
However, ministers say they will not negotiate on pay as they have met independent pay recommendations.
Chris Hewett, paramedic and Unison member, was at the picket line in Filton. He said: ""It's been a relatively quiet morning, we're at a third of our normal 999 level.
""So it means the public are supporting us and looking after themselves and find other ways of caring themselves other than calling 999.""
Wednesday's strike comes after South Western Ambulance Service declared a critical incident on Tuesday, after they had more than 700 calls waiting to be dispatched. 
Mr Hewett said: ""When I came on shift yesterday there were over 750 999 calls that we had not been able to get ambulances to across the region. 
""That's a normal day - it's quieter today because people are aware of the strike but it shows that the NHS is broken and the ambulance service is crippled by a lack of funding and a real recruitment and retention crisis.""
rmed forces have been drafted in to help manage any impact of today's strike with about two dozen army medics brought in to help South Western Ambulance Service, according to Mr Hewett. 
ramedic said wages have gone down 20 per cent in real terms and Unison members were prepared to keep going with strike action. 
""What we're saying to people, if they need us, then dial 999 and someone will come and help,"" he said.
NHS bosses in Somerset have also warned today services are under ""extreme pressure"" not just due to strikes but due to a combination of cold weather, concerns about Strep A infections, and an increase in Flu.
Bernie Marden, chief medical officer, NHS Somerset said: ""Regardless of any industrial action taking place, it is important that patients who need urgent medical care continue to come forward.""
Connor Calby, a paramedic who works across Bristol and Somerset said to BBC Radio Bristol that staff were struggling to pay their energy bills and with the wider cost of living crisis. 
Unison member said staff had been put in a ""very difficult"" position over striking.
He said: ""We all joined this profession because we wanted to make a difference to people and make sure they got the best care and none of us took it lightly.
""In the South West 85.6 per cent of us were in favour of strike action and I think that says volumes about how everyone feels at the moment."" 
Chris Nelson, Gloucestershire Police and Crime Commissioner said the sheer demand on the ambulance services has led to resources being lost from police. 
He said: ""Over the last six months we have had a lot more involvement with NHS-related issues where our partners can't meet their demand. 
""On average we have 50 or so calls a day in the force control room about ambulance-related issues to do with concerns for welfare.""
Mr Nelson gave an example of an incident last week where police had to convey an elderly man to hospital after a fall on the ice which left him with a suspected hip and leg injury. The waiting time for an ambulance to arrive was estimated to be six hours. 
Four police units, meaning at least four officers but possibly eight, attended along with and a fire unit which could have had four to five fire officers.
Police and the fire officers spent two hours asking for an ambulance to attend, Mr Nelson said. 
Eventually they took the man to hospital on a stretcher at the request of ambulance service but were then turned away from Cheltenham Hospital and told to go to Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. 
Mr Nelson added he was ""sympathetic"" to those striking over low pay.
Further strike action is planned on 28 December and concerns have been raised over its impact considering it comes after four bank holidays. 
Not all unions are striking for the same hours of Wednesday. And it is difficult to say how many workers are striking at each individual service. In some areas, such as the East of England, there is no current plan to strike.

business	Cardiff cafe staffed by autistic people fears closure	"A cafe ran by autistic people could be closed by new year due to an unresolved rent dispute.
In WhatsApp messages seen by BBC Wales, Cardiff's Aubergine Cafe was told its rent could increase from £800 to £1,200 per month when the tenancy renewed at the end of the year. 
Following attempts to negotiate, the cafe's ability to renew the lease hangs in the balance.
rd said they did not want to comment.
After the director of the cafe, Selena Caemawr, attempted to negotiate the rent price, they were told the landlord no longer wanted to renew the tenancy. 
However, following a community rally and an Instagram campaign, the landlord reversed their decision, but the cafe is yet to receive a renewal agreement from the landlord but will have to close by the new year if it is unable to renew.
Selena set up the cafe after facing difficulties in various jobs, often finding themselves put on extended probationary periods because they struggled to keep up with time-dependent and admin tasks.
: ""I knew I could do my job if I was supported properly. But nobody would listen to me when I told them what sort of support I needed. It's like they didn't believe me.
""I remember writing a post on Facebook where I said that the problem with being autistic and in the workplace is that everyone else isn't autistic. And if they were just everything would just work better.""
From there, a spark was born for Aubergine Cafe - it started as a pop-up business and then moved to its current home in Riverside in 2019. 
It is run entirely by neurodiverse people and has an almost-silent coffee machine, adjustable lighting and staff organise cutlery outside of opening hours as autistic people sometimes struggle with sensory overload. 
As well as working to support autistic people into full-time professional employment, Aubergine Café commissions freelance neurodivergent artists to host workshops. 
Selena said: ""It's really important for us to give people proper steps into professional employment, not just volunteering opportunities.
""We want to be the role models we never got to see for ourselves.""
Sarah Smart, 24, who has a learning disability, works at Aubergine Cafe three days a week, learning about all aspects of the job. 
If the cafe closes, Sarah's ability to work is at risk: ""I know they'd find another premises, but I'd have to re-learn how to get to that place in Cardiff which would be difficult for me.
""People in the area wouldn't have the cafe local to them anymore and this would have a big impact on our community.""
Another user of the café, who asked to remain anonymous, said the Aubergine Cafe ""made me feel like Cardiff has a place for me"" through the way it celebrates queerness and neurodivergence.
Roz Moreton, 57, discovered the cafe through her work with Disability Arts Cymru, said it was a special and vital place.
""We need more safe places not just for people to go to but for people to work at,"" said Ms Moreton.
Disability Arts Cymru is working with Aubergine Café on its Creativity is Mistakes project which works to connect with disabled artists and showcase their work.
Ms Moreton said: ""It's really important that we support each other because it's quite hard out there for us."""	/news/uk-wales-63911682

business	Diesel prices reach record of over £1.80 a litre	"UK diesel prices rose to a record of just over £1.80 a litre as efforts to stop importing fuel from Russia pushed up costs for retailers, the RAC said.
After the previous record of £1.79 was set in March following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, prices dipped but have risen again in recent weeks.
RAC said petrol prices went up by nearly 3p a litre since the start of May and were £1.66 a litre on average.
It said if EU members agreed to ban Russian oil, prices could rise further.
EU has been focusing for weeks on how to wean itself off Russian energy and has plans to phase out Russian crude oil over six months.
However, countries are split on how soon they wind down dependence - Hungary has rejected the proposal as unacceptable and the Czech and Slovak governments want a transition period.
UK is not as dependent on Russian oil as the EU is, however, almost a fifth of all UK diesel consumption was provided by Russian imports in 2020.
UK is also affected when global prices rise, despite its plans to stop Russian oil imports by the end of the year.
""Efforts to move away from importing Russian diesel have led to a tightening of supply and pushed up the price retailers pay for diesel,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams.
""Unfortunately, drivers with diesel vehicles need to brace themselves for yet more pain at the pumps."" 
In recent weeks, fuel sales have fallen as drivers have cut back on the number of journeys they make due to higher pump prices
Petrol station operator Ascona Group, which owns 60 UK petrol stations, said the amount of fuel it sold had dropped by 200,000 litres a week compared to pre-pandemic levels.
Managing director Darren Briggs said customers were making £20 to £30 fuel purchases ""last a little bit longer"".
Office for National Statistics revealed last week that the UK's economy shrank by 0.1% in March and said higher prices, including those at the petrol pumps, were ""really beginning to bite"".
wnturn came ahead of the impact of higher energy bills in April, which has sparked fears from analysts that the UK economy is at risk of a recession - defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods - later this year.
Cutting diesel imports is tough
Analysis by Ben King, BBC business reporter
Cutting energy imports from Russia is a vital part of the West's plan to put the squeeze on the Putin regime and its war machine.
But when it comes to diesel, it's particularly tough - not least for the UK.
Diesel is produced by refining crude oil, and before the war, much of the UK's diesel supply was made in Russia and shipped to Britain in tankers.
Diesel supplies across the world were low before the crisis began, and the uncertainty surrounding the latest round of EU sanctions is helping to push those prices higher.
Most European countries are already reducing their imports of Russian oil and diesel - and imports from the Middle East and elsewhere are taking up some of the slack. But securing those extra supplies means paying higher prices. 
figures from the data firm Vortexa showed that just over half Europe's diesel imports were still coming from Russia. 
And the Asian head of the major oil trading firm Vitol, Mike Muller, warned earlier this month that EU rules which came into force on Sunday could make trading with Russia even harder, for instance by making it impossible to pay Russian suppliers.
's not likely to mean pumps running dry in the UK, says analyst Neil Crosby, who follows the diesel market for OilX.
""The UK itself may manage more or less to get by, but retail prices are not liable to cool any time soon,"" he said.  
In a bid to curb rising fuel prices, Chancellor Rishi Sunak cut the fuel duty by 5p a litre after previous record prices were seen in March.
RAC said then the cut was ""a drop in the ocean"" and now claimed drivers would be better off if had Mr Sunak reduced VAT on fuel.
""Had Mr Sunak reduced VAT to 15% as we called on him to do instead of cutting duty by 5p, drivers of diesel vehicles would be around 2p a litre better off, or £1 for every full tank,"" Mr Williams said.
""As it is, drivers are still paying 27p VAT on petrol and 29p on diesel, which is just the same as before the Spring Statement.""
reasury said it had introduced the ""biggest ever cut to all fuel duty rates - worth £5bn when taken together with the fuel duty freeze"".
""It will save the average UK car driver around £100, van driver around £200 and haulier over £1,500, based on average fuel consumption,"" a statement said.
government said businesses in general pay VAT on their sales but recover the tax on their purchases, meaning many can reclaim any VAT incurred when buying fuel.

business	US economy adds more jobs than expected in June	"US economy created 372,000 jobs in June, according to official figures, with employment growing by far more than forecast.
Economists had expected the country to add between 250,000 and 295,000 roles.
unemployment rate also remained close to record lows, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
rong jobs figures are being seen by some analysts as a sign that more US interest rate rises could be on the way.
Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors, said: ""Today's job number should soothe fears of an imminent recession, but it does nothing to relieve fears of considerable further Fed tightening.
""The job market remains severely tight, suggesting still-intense wage pressures.""
unemployment rate stayed at 3.6% in June for the fourth month in a row. 
Like other countries, the cost of living in the US is soaring due to rising food and energy prices. Inflation hit a 40-year high of 8.6% in the year to April and the US Federal Reserve has been increasing borrowing costs to try to cool the rate of  price growth.
Last month, the Fed announced its biggest interest rate rise in nearly 30 years, increasing its key interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 1.5% to 1.75%.
In the first three months of the year the US economy contracted at an annual pace of 1.6%, and Fed chairman Jay Powell recently admitted to lawmakers that a recession is ""a possibility"".
Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, said the ""strong jobs report contrasts with other recent economic announcements"".
""The US economy and the stock market have both struggled in the first half of 2022, in the face of risks that include a multi-decade high in inflation, aggressive monetary policy tightening, and the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, "" he said. 
""However, jobs reports are lagging economic indicators that are often strong entering a downturn."""	/news/business-62093303
health	OCD: How to cope over Christmas and New Year	"Over the festive period Sam Jones would love to be able to hug his mum but he's not sure if he can. 
35-year-old is one of an estimated 750,000 people in the UK with the serious anxiety-related condition obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
He has Harm OCD, which means he has ""deeply upsetting"" and ""very, very graphic"" violent and sexual intrusive thoughts of harming others.
Hugging some people, including his mother, can trigger those thoughts. 
""The most painful thing is sometimes I really want to give my mum a hug and I can't do it and you just feel like a rubbish person because of it,"" he said.
""You really genuinely feel like you might cause some harm to them or something."" 
He said it starts with a difficult thought about hurting someone.
followed by a fear that he will carry out that action.  
""Then the anxiety will rise and as that rises and rises you feel compelled to perform these compulsions, to sort of quell that anxiety and keep confirming to yourself, 'I'm a good person, I'm a good person',"" he explained. 
Sam said he often found it difficult to hug women and children as he worries he is going to harm them.  
g and changes of routine at Christmas can exacerbate Sam's intrusive thoughts.
""It's going out to the shop... being around lots of people,"" he said. 
""To spend the whole time extremely tense and just wanting to get out of there - but not wanting to get out of the room - it's really hard, it's really upsetting,"" he said. 
""Of course you can get labelled as grumpy of a bit of a recluse and that adds to the shame that you're already feeling."" 
Sam does not drink alcohol. 
He said: ""That's something that will spike my symptoms because of that feeling of being out of control.""
Getting ready for a Christmas event might also be all the more challenging for Sam. On a bad day it can take him up to 45 minutes to put a jumper on as he feels compelled to take it on and off until it feels right.
When Sam was 29 he said he hit rock bottom and felt suicidal. 
At the time he was experiencing a relationship OCD and said he was repeatedly asking himself, ""Am I in love? Is this real love? Am I leading this person on?""
He said ""it can take over your life"".
He went to his GP which eventually led to his diagnosis. He was treated with a form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with exposure and response prevention (ERP) and peer support groups. 
Sam said he also armed himself with information from OCD Action, OCD UK and The OCD Stories podcast. 
""I still have really hard days where I really struggle and I have days when it's fantastic,"" he said. 
re are many types of OCD, most of which can be made more challenging by Christmas, Sam said. 
He said for instance someone with contamination OCD, where someone obsesses over catching an illness or spreading germs, will find it hard to visit people's homes, hugging, eating food prepared by others or being in a big group.
Someone with religious OCD, where they have obsessive religious doubts and fears or unwanted blasphemous thoughts and images, cold be triggered by the religious symbolism and rituals of Christmas. 
Sam has heard people using the term OCD flippantly, as a joke or in a way that trivialises the condition, something he finds ""deeply upsetting"".
""It affects you a very visceral level.
""If you see an Obsessive Christmas Disorder jumper or something... it just makes you feel really angry.""
Craig Evans, 30, from Swansea, also has OCD.
He needs everything to feel perfect or ""just right"" to feel comfortable. 
Since his early teens he has been checking things and switching things on and off in multiples of four - he fears if he does not do this something bad will happen. 
His routine involves ensuring light switches are aligned in a particular way and always putting his sock on his left foot before his right. 
He was diagnosed in his mid-20s and said CBT and exposure therapy had helped. 
He finds Christmas particularly challenging because of changes to his routine and seeing more people. 
""Certain rituals and certain routines that I have at the moment, if they get knocked off course that can raise my anxiety levels,"" he said.
""It may be something trivial like I can't have my food in peace or I can't watch my favourite telly program a particular time, that raises my anxiety levels and I have to carry out the cycle with my compulsions.""
He can also find other people's homes difficult.
""For example, glasses not lined up as how I'd wish them to be,"" he said. 
""You get shaky, you get clammy, your heart races, palpitations.""
Sam chose to keep his Christmas small, spending it with just three other people.
He will be focusing on being in the moment, taking walks in nature, exercising and being with his fiancée.
He said the best way to help someone with OCD have an easier Christmas is to educate themselves about the conduction.
Craig also likes to keep things as simple as possible at Christmas.
""If I was to attend lots of different parties and go out and visit a lot I'd find that very difficult to cope with,"" he said. 
He said others could help by accepting there may be times when the person with OCD is not quite themselves.
In support groups Craig said had heard of one person with OCD intentionally overcooking Christmas dinner for fear of poisoning their family.
Another spent Christmas day obsessively cleaning their kitchen.
""The worst thing you can say to them is 'just stop it' - that trivialises it,"" he said. 
""To you it might be ridiculous but to that person that's suffering in that moment it's a very, very distressing.""
