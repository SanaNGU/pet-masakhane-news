business	Switching to green fuel needs same urgency as Covid jab, says energy boss	"UK would be paying ""billions"" of pounds less for its energy, if it had stuck with plans to reduce fossil fuel use, an energy boss has said.
Greg Jackson, chief executive of Octopus energy, told the BBC there should be a concerted push now.
me ""sense of urgency"" should be applied to the switch to green energy, as there was for finding a Covid vaccine, he said.
government said it had delivered a 500% increase in renewables since 2010.
""Without the clean energy we have deployed over the past decade, bills would be even higher today,"" a spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said. 
re were already plans to invest further in renewables, BEIS said.
In 2013, the coalition government led by David Cameron made a series of changes, including cutting back support for energy efficiency and later ended subsidies for onshore wind.
""If we hadn't done that, energy bills this year would be billions of pounds lower than they are,"" Mr Jackson told the Big Green Money Show on BBC Radio 5 Live. 
""It's short term behaviour that has left us even more exposed than we need to be.""
Octopus Energy generates electricity from renewable sources, including wind and solar and supplies energy to three million UK customers.
A report earlier this year by energy analysis site Carbon Brief said bills in the UK were nearly £2.5bn higher than they would have been if climate policies had not been scrapped over the past decade.
""We now need to get on with it, and going green will not only help prevent the catastrophic climate change we see already changing weather patterns, but will also drive energy costs down,"" Mr Jackson said.
Mr Jackson said he believed the process of creating new renewables could be speeded up significantly.
use it was the planning, consent and connection to the grid that took several years, while the engineering of a new wind turbine could be done in a year.
""In the pandemic we took that normal fifteen year process for producing and licensing a vaccine and we did it in a year.
""If we were to act with the same sense of urgency, we could let communities who want it have access to cheap energy quickly enough to make a difference,"" he said.
Some customers who have signed up to green energy suppliers have questioned why their bills aren't already lower than the typical bill, when the cost of generating electricity through renewables is lower than using fossil fuels.
But the price of electricity is currently determined for the whole market by the cost of gas because it is the most expensive form of generation.
Mr Jackson said if the UK moved towards a situation where renewables provided the bulk of energy needs and gas was ""a gap filler"", then the link between the gas and electricity prices could be addressed.
However, it would take several years, before increased renewable generation had an impact on prices for consumers, according to energy analyst David Cox.
""It's a bit of a dream,"" he said. ""To increase wind power, which is the only one you could build quickly, is five to 10 years away before you have a significant contribution.
""That's assuming you can get the parts and the steel, and the cost of that is going to go through the roof because of the cost of gas.""
Subsidising energy efficiency measures, such as home insulation, would be a faster way to reduce gas use and bring down bills, Mr Cox said.
Energy prices have become an urgent political issue in the Conservative leadership race.
frontrunner, Liz Truss, has pledged to suspend the green levy on energy bills, which in the past funded investment in renewable energy. On Tuesday she hinted she would look at providing further support to businesses and households with soaring energy costs. 
However, unlike her rival Rishi Sunak, she has ruled out energy rationing. 
Mr Sunak has pledged to scrap VAT on household energy for one year and has promised more money to help with bills.
A BEIS spokesperson said: ""Since 2010, we have delivered a 500% increase in the amount of renewable energy capacity connected to the grid - more than any other government in British history.""
""To build on this progress, the government recent secured an additional 11GW of clean power in July's renewable auction, and we plan to go even further by driving £100billion of private sector investment in clean energy this decade."""	/news/business-62753949
technology	UK tech talent shortage threatens to stifle growth in the industry	"UK technology sector has a talent shortage which could ""stifle growth"", an industry body has warned.
Liz Scott, from TechNation, said it was ""a real issue"" which must be rectified. 
re were more than two million UK job vacancies in tech last year, more than any other labour area, but an industry coalition says nearly 12 million workers lack essential digital skills. 
government told the BBC it was working very closely with industry on digital skills training. 
However, schemes like boot camps, apprenticeships and degree apprenticeships do not seem to be enough to address the gap. 
Michelle Donelan, former education minister, said: ""Employers both large and small are crying out for more people to be trained in digital skills. 
""An apprenticeship is a fantastic way to achieve that. Not just for young people, but also those looking to upskill.""
But, according to government figures, nearly half of all apprentices across all sectors, not only in tech, dropped out last year. 
Data cited in the latest UK jobs report from professional services network KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation showed candidate numbers for job vacancies has been falling.
report said this is because of:
One place which is teaching young people important tech subjects is ADA, the National College for Digital Skills, in London. 
It encourages students towards core Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and mathematics - that form the backbone of the industry.
Principal Tina Gotschi said: ""A lot of the jobs that these students will do in the future don't even exist at this point - a lot of those will be digital jobs. 
""The college was initially founded to address the skills gap, but unfortunately over time, it is just getting greater. 
""The pipeline of students coming through is shrinking and there is a lack of computer science teachers too.""
re is a financial incentive to getting digital skills. According to TechNation, tech salaries are nearly 80% higher, on average, than salaries for non-tech jobs in the UK. 
rage tech salary is £62,000, which is more than double the average household income in the UK. 
Ronan Harris, managing director of Google (UK and Ireland) told the BBC that big tech companies are trying to play a part in providing people with qualifications.
""We've trained over 800,000 people in the UK in a range of digital skills,"" he said.
""We want people to be excited about technology. But increasingly, what we're seeing is all jobs that are being advertised have some form of digital requirement to them."" 
It's a sentiment with which Ben Francis, founder of online clothing apparel company Gymshark, agrees.
""The historical view of someone that works in tech, he's probably, you know, a bit more of like a geeky sort of person. 
""But I think the more unconventional view of techies is that tech is a creative outlet."" 
Gymshark is a UK tech start-up success story. The company achieved unicorn status in 2020, meaning it is valued at $1bn (£848m) or higher.
""If you're a great graphic designer, if you're a great web designer, if you want to create great apps or NFTs - all of that is done through tech and understanding of tech,"" said the entrepreneur.
James Hallahan, director at recruitment company Hays, said: ""Due to the increase in digital transformation over the past few years - the demand for tech talent shows no signs of slowing down.""
He added that roles with skill shortages included software developers, data scientists, data analysts, enterprise architects and programme and project managers.
However, a sizeable chunk of the British workforce is nowhere near skilled enough to apply for positions like those, according to industry coalition FutureDotNow. It says that some 11.8 million workers lack basic digital skills - let alone more complex ones.
However, Ms Scott says: ""There are good jobs available here. We just need people to understand that they're available and then know how to access them and know where to get the right signpost in for retraining or reskilling courses.""
Where people live may also be becoming less of a barrier.
Over the last decade, UK companies like Deliveroo, Darktrace and Depop have been started, funded and scaled by driven entrepreneurs and investors. 
Fintech companies are also growing, with the likes of Monzo, Starling, Marshmallow and Cazoo all achieving unicorn status. 
majority of them have had major ties to London, but that is slowly changing.
Demand for tech talent is increasing across the UK with the number of professionals with the right skills expanding at a faster pace in the north of England than in London, according to information technology company Accenture. 
Shaheen Sayed, its technology lead in the UK, said: ""Businesses have been bullish in investing in technology and hiring - particularly in skills such as AI, cloud and robotics.
""The pool of technology professionals is also expanding, with growth in the north [of England] outpacing growth in the south [of England], and emerging technology hubs in Edinburgh and Manchester starting to compete with the capital.""

sports	Chinese outcry after volleyballers wear N95 masks during match	"A volleyball match which saw China's national women's team compete while wearing N95 masks has caused a stir on Chinese social media. 
Many netizens expressed their anger, suggesting that the health of players was being sacrificed for the sake of the country's zero-Covid strategy. 
rs later took their masks off for the second set and went on to win.
China's Volleyball Association later apologised, saying the decision was made was due to a ""lack of experience"".
But many remained critical, with one saying it was an example of officials taking China's mask mandate ""too far"". 
""Our leaders are... taking things too far - it's as simple as that,"" one user wrote.
k place on Thursday at the Asian Cup in the Philippines and saw the Chinese team go up against Iran.
Photos from the match, showing the athletes with their masks on, quickly circulated on social media - triggering an uncommon outpouring of criticism online, with more than 16 million views on the topic on Weibo, China's largest social media platform.
One Weibo comment wrote: ""Is health or performance more important? We need to take some responsibility towards our athletes.""
Another said: ""How long will this so-called epidemic prevention farce continue? Do we want to become the butt of all other countries' jokes?""
fury online prompted the Chinese Volleyball Association to respond on Thursday with a public apology.
In a statement on Weibo, it explained that team organisers prior to the game had learnt of Covid- infected players in other teams and said some symptoms had been reported among Chinese team members.  
revent the spread, they required their players wear masks upon entering the venue. But because they were unclear on whether players had to wear masks on court, the team kept them on during the first half, they said. 
After losing the first set, most players later took their masks off during half-time - and later won 3-1 against Iran. 
""After realising that playing with a mask is not good for the health of the players, the team reminded us in time [so] that our players took off the masks and finished the next game,"" the organisers said.
ment also made reference to the new ""difficulties"" faced by Chinese teams competing abroad - whose members largely have not previously been exposed to Covid.
China continues to employ some of the strictest Covid restrictions in the world including an indoor and outdoor mask mandate, severe, sudden lockdowns and closed borders.
However, this is not the first time athletes have worn masks during sports matches.
Earlier this year, an ice hockey  match between Canada and the Russian Olympic Committee saw both sides wear masks, due to ""safety and security concerns"" over pending test results.

business	Lowestoft: 'If empty shops open up everybody wins'	"In the Queen's Speech the government announced that councils would get new planning powers to force landlords in England to let out empty shops to rejuvenate high streets. What do people in the Suffolk coastal town of Lowestoft, the UK's most easterly point, make of the plans?
Home to more than 70,000 people the coastal town of Lowestoft is the most easterly settlement in the UK.
who live there say the town has been caught in a vicious economic circle in recent years.
As shop after shop has closed, the fewer visitors come and the cycle continues.
Mandy Peterson, has run Lennie's, a plant shop in the town for four years. 
""I took voluntary redundancy and I thought I would use that money to set myself up in a business that I thought I would enjoy doing.
""Lowestoft has taken a real dip in how much retail there is here, it doesn't look so nice to walk through when everywhere is closed. 
She says local shop keepers do work together and ""help each other"". 
Her message to anyone thinking of opening a new business - ""give it a go.""
She does not think forcing landlords to let out empty shop units will work in all situations. 
""I'm not sure if we should force anybody to do anything personally, the thought of empty shops being open, marvellous, everybody wins. The landlord wins for the rent, the community wins for the financial  flow and it's a better area for everyone to live in.""
She remembers a time when in the '80s and '90s there were ""nice shops"" with ""loads of choice"" in Lowestoft. 
""I was born here, so I've seen a big change. It's awful if you're a local person and you've seen the town that you've lived in all your life go down.""
She believes things could turn around if there is the ""will and the finance"" in place. 
Pamela Norman says Lowestoft has ""gone downhill very badly, there's nothing"", so she does not come into town a lot. 
""It needs to be more people friendly, there's just nothing here""
re are only ""a couple of shops, there's not a lot""
""Awful"" is what Nicki Cross thinks of the seaside town. 
She also believes it has gone ""downhill so much, I've lived here all my life and there's nothing here"". 
""Regeneration"" is the answer, she said.
""The shops are closing left, right and centre, we're just getting no new trade, the road network system is absolutely awful.  
""Something seriously needs to be done as the town is dying a death.""
Danny Steel, a commercial property specialist and chairman of the business improvement group, Lowestoft Vision, believes the government's scheme to make sure empty shops are taken over, will have some positives.  
""In some cases yes it will and in other cases it could cause problems, the devil is in the detail,"" he said.
Mr Steel does not think just having retail shops is the answer as the nature of town centres is changing. 
He would like to see coffee bars, restaurants, nail bars, doctors' surgeries and dentists, alongside shops and homes. 
Plans are in place to turn units in the town into housing and ""we want that, we need a thriving,  breathing, living town centre"", he said.
""Wouldn't it be great if in the evenings there were children playing out in the pedestrian precinct... it would be a proper community.""
He does not think Lowestoft is any different to most towns, as he think Brexit, the Covid-19 pandemic and internet shopping has all added to changes. 
""Last year something like 30 percent of all sales were internet based so the whole retail offering from town centres is reducing very very quickly.
""It would be great to see the town centres busy again and bustling, but bustling maybe for different things rather than retail.""

health	Police asked to help during Welsh ambulance strike, says health minister	"Welsh government has been discussing with police whether they can help resuscitate patients during next week's ambulance staff strike.
Action over pay by the three main ambulance unions on 21 December will affect non-life threatening calls only.
But the Police Federation raised doubts about officers dealing with medical emergencies they are not qualified for. 
Wales' health minister said officials have been speaking to police about ""helping with resuscitation and so on"".
Welsh Ambulance Service will face strike action next Wednesday, along with most ambulance services in England.
Police Federation, representing officers across England and Wales, has expressed misgivings about being asked to cover the work of ambulance staff.
Federation National Chair Steve Hartshorn said on Tuesday: ""I have genuine concern for any officer who may be exposed to medical emergencies they are not qualified to act on. 
""The human consequences are awful to imagine, but we must consider the legal responsibilities and practicalities too. 
""Should a patient die in the presence of a police officer, or within a period of time of being with a police officer, that officer is referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct for investigation.""
Responding to a question from Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price in the Senedd, Eluned Morgan said: ""We have been speaking, for example, to the police, in terms of the police helping with resuscitation and so on.""
Ms Morgan said the Welsh government do not intend to use ""the armed forces unless that's truly necessary"".
She explained that would remain the position unless there was a ""serious problem in keeping the public safe"".
Mr Price said his party had ""serious concerns about using the police in this way"".

technology	'I wouldn't leave South Africa, I have a kid here'	"Software firm boss Stanford Mogotsi says he remains committed to South Africa, despite the challenges of running a small IT firm in the country.
""It's my home, I have a kid, I have a family here,"" says the 47-year-old.
Mr Mogotsi co-owns Johannesburg-based software company Nane Solutions with his friend and business partner Kabelo Mashishi, 44.
Both have come a long way since growing up in one of South Africa's townships during apartheid.
Each studied computer science at university, and then spent a number of years in corporate IT jobs, before launching Nane in 2006.
r initial work was consultancy - advising firms such as MTN, South Africa's largest mobile phone network, and state-owned power company Eskom.
But they found consulting frustrating because they wanted to build software from the ground up, rather than just advise.
r first major foray into designing software was creating a system for world football governing body Fifa to manage volunteers at the 2010 World Cup, which was held in South Africa.
2017 they created software that helped brewing group Heineken improve its transportation system in the country. Another big project win was developing an app for phone service Talk360.
Yet it hasn't all been plain sailing for the firm. Nane means eight in Swahili, and the name was chosen because the company had eight founders.
However, the shift from consulting to the risker business of software development, and then the impact of South Africa's tough coronavirus lockdowns, resulted in all but Mr Mogotsi and Mr Mashisi leaving the business.
""It's really difficult to win work when you are a small firm,"" says Mr Mogotsi. ""We have to compete with multinationals, and potential clients tend to want to go for these tried and tested big IT firms, especially when the economic backdrop in South Africa is uncertain.""
Prof Duncan Coulter, head of the Academy of Computer Science and Software Engineering at the University of Johannesburg, agrees that times are difficult for South African IT companies like Nane.
While Mr Mogotsi and Mr Mashisi are staying in South Africa, Prof Coulter says that the continuing big problem for the country's IT sector is a brain drain - people finding jobs overseas.
""A lot of our better students are now off in Europe, America and Asia, are doing very well for themselves, we're very proud of them,"" he says.
""And as part of the general brain drain [away from South Africa], they definitely have opportunities to move more easily than professions like lawyer and doctors.""
As a result of all these young IT professionals finding work overseas, Prof Coulter says that firms in the sector in South Africa can now struggle to fill positions.
Mr Mashisi says that ""salary-wise we can't compete"" with what large firms overseas can offer. ""So as soon as someone's got a year or two's worth of experience, then it's easy for them to be snapped up [and go abroad].""
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
Yet despite this brain drain, South Africa still has successful software start-ups that are producing popular products.
An example of this is the app EskomSePush, which warns users across South Africa when to expect power cuts.
Such power cuts or ""load-sheddings"" are a regular occurrence in the country, due to the continuing energy generation shortfalls at power firm Eskom.
Sometimes people have to go without power for 10 hours a day, and there's no end in sight, with shortfalls due to continue until 2027.
EskomSePush is the brainchild of co-founders Dan Wells (35) and Herman Maritz, who launched the app in 2015 and run it from their Cape Town homes.
It collects and processes complicated load-shedding schedules from Eskom and local governments across South Africa. Notifications are then sent out to the app's users telling them exactly when the power will be out in their neighbourhood and for how long.
Mr Wells says that within six months of launching the app 250,000 people had downloaded it, ""which was crazy back then"".
He adds that today the app is ""on seven million devices, and about a million people will click on a notification almost immediately"".
monetised through advertising revenues, and Mr Wells' advise for software developers is ""gain a taste for having problems, find your community and solve some problems"".
If there is one thing that unites South Africans it is a love of sport, with cricket being the third most popular in the country.
At the University of Johannesburg, computer science lecturer Tevin Moodley and Prof Dustin van der Haar, have developed a cricket video software system that aims to help produce the next generation of world-beating South African batsmen and women.
Its software can automatically identify the different strokes played by a particular batsman from a recording of a test match or other game.
means that a cricket coach can play numerous clips of a certain shot, without having to laboriously go through all the footage to first find them.
ws quick analysis of the player's execution of the shot in question, where they are standing, and their foot placements. From that, recommendations and improvements can be made, and young players can compare their performance with video recordings of former cricketing greats.
""My belief is if you're able to improve the batter's skill level, you're able to improve your team's chances of winning,"" says Mr Moodley. ""So the impact of our work will be very big within the space of cricket.""
At the moment, Mr Moodley uses YouTube clips of test matches to collect footage, but he hopes to work with Cricket South Africa to secure more videos.
While the software is currently still in the research stage, Mr Moodley says that given the right investors and stakeholders he would look to build a commercial product.
But in the meantime his focus is trying to help the next generation of South African cricketers. ""I want to keep it local and try to help our team,"" he says."	/news/business-63646696

re now looking at whether it can be used to detect cancers.   
gnose patients in a matter of minutes with an accuracy of around 98%.
Researcher Prof Naeem Ramzan said: ""Systems such as this could prove to be crucial for busy medical teams worldwide.""
uberculosis and pneumonia often require a combination of tests like CT scans, blood tests, X-rays and ultrasounds to diagnose.
But these tests can be expensive and time consuming. 
Prof Ramzan told BBC Scotland that in normal circumstances, diagnosis can take weeks depending on the radiologist's availability.
""But in most cases, the app can produce results in a minute so treatment can be started as soon as possible,"" he said.
gy uses X-rays, then compares the scans to a database of thousands of images from patients with pneumonia, tuberculosis and Covid.
It then uses a process known as deep convolutional neural network, an algorithm typically used to analyse imagery, to make a diagnosis.
Researchers at the institution are now looking into using the technology to detect other diseases using X-ray images like cancer. 
""X-ray imaging is a relatively cheap and accessible diagnostic tool that already assists in the diagnosis of various conditions, including pneumonia, tuberculosis and Covid-19,"" said Prof Ramzan.
""Recent advances in AI have made automated diagnosis using chest X-ray scans a very real prospect in medical settings.""
However, the new technology could take up to a year to be approved for wider use.
Prof Ramzan added: ""We would like to roll it out worldwide and make it freely available to anyone who would like to use it, either in the NHS or abroad as well.""

health	Linden Centre: Jayden Booroff's abscond risk not recorded - inquest	"A 23-year-old man who died after fleeing a mental health unit was not properly recorded as being an ""absconding risk"", an inquest heard.
Jayden Booroff absconded from the Linden Centre in Chelmsford, Essex, on 23 October 2020.
Patient safety investigator Paul Binyon told Essex Coroner's Court that written care notes showed he was an ""absconding risk and an impulsivity risk"".
Jurors heard this was missing from the SBAR electronic forms used by staff.
Mr Booroff, described as a talented musician, had been sectioned twice at the point he left the Linden Centre's Finchingfield Ward shortly after 19:45 BST.
His body was found near Chelmsford railway station about two hours later.
quest heard he had a history of undiagnosed mental health issues and was being given anti-psychotic medication.
Mr Binyon's serious incident investigation, on behalf of the Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, noted that staff observations of Mr Booroff were reduced two days before his death, from four times per hour to once per hour, which did not follow a ""detailed plan"".
""The heightened level of engagement leading to the incident may have given opportunity to detect behaviours, such as an unusual interest in exit routes, which may have indicated an impending attempt to abscond,"" he said on Thursday.
urt was told a nurse tried to ""grab"" Mr Booroff as he fled the unit, but that she had left her Pinpoint security alarm, used for alerting colleagues, in her car after arriving late to her shift.
report outlined nine similar incidents between 2017 and 2020 where inpatients ""tailgated"" staff out of unclosed doors.
""Lessons learnt had not been completed [on incident forms] leading the investigation to find that risk tolerance had been bound in favour of accepting the inevitability of absconding,"" said Mr Binyon.
""There were missed opportunities to learn from patient safety incidents.""
matron at the time of Mr Booroff's absconding previously told jurors that staff would always discuss what ""they've learnt"" from each incident.

business	Port of Felixstowe: What do strikes at UK's biggest container port mean?	"Workers at Felixstowe, the UK's busiest container port, have returned to work after an eight-day strike. But what impact did the industrial action have on shipping in and out of the terminal?
Port of Felixstowe in Suffolk is a vast operation and handles almost half of the UK's container trade.
For the past eight days, hundreds of workers, who are members of the union Unite, were on strike.
BBC asked the Port of Felixstowe what impact this action had on shipping and UK supply chains, but the port declined to comment on the record.
Instead, the BBC turned to available shipping data to see if it could shed some light.
MarineTraffic is a global maritime analytics provider.
Alex Charvalias, the company's supply chain in-transit visibility lead, said: ""While the Felixstowe port is still trying to handle the congestion caused by the [previous] strike in August, it is now feeling the impact of the latest strike.""
One of the key measures used in shipping is the TEU, which is stands for twenty-foot equivalent units - the size of a standard shipping container.
He pointed to a big increase in the number of containers on ships waiting to come into port, compared to the pre-strike volume earlier in the summer.
""On 30 September, the total TEU capacity waiting 'off port limits' [just outside a port] for container ships has been the highest observed in recent months, reaching more than 65,500 TEUs,"" said Mr Charvalias. 
Between June and July, the capacity of containerships waiting off port limits was between 20,000 and 30,000 TEUs.
""The disruptions of this strike... and the new one planned from 11 to 17 October in the port of Liverpool, will unquestionably aggravate even more the congestion.""
How long are container ships having to wait in port?
MarineTraffic said the full data for the current week was not yet available.
However, during the previous eight-day strike in August, container ship in-port waits rose from between one and two days to eight days.
Do longer waits in port matter?
Possibly not, according to one person the BBC spoke to with knowledge of the port's operations.
BBC was told that because of the wider slowdown in the UK economy, retailers were not currently as dependent on getting new stock in as they had previously been.
urce said logistics managers, in the wake of the global pandemic, factored in ""expected disruption"" to their operations.
Founded as The Felixstowe Railway and Pier Company in 1875, the port has main two terminals running along the north bank of the Harwich Harbour estuary - Landguard and Trinity - and a roll on/roll off facility.
rinity has seven deep-water berths, one of Europe's longest continuous quays measuring 2.5 km (1.5 miles), 17 ship-to-shore gantry cranes, 48 rubber-tyred gantry cranes, 10 high-stacking container handlers and four top loading reach-stackers.
Berths eight and nine were built at the Landguard Terminal to accommodate the world's largest container ship, the Olympic class MSC Oscar, which can carry 19,224 TEU containers.
Each year, Felixstowe sees in about 2,000 ships, handles four million TEUs and hosts 17 different shipping lines.
But what do shipping companies do when there is industrial action at a port?
One industry insider told the BBC: ""The ships that call at Felixstowe will call at other ports as well on the way.
""So, if there is industrial action in Felixstowe, they might unload the Felixstowe cargo at another port and then reload on to the next ship.
""Shipping lines tend to prefer to delay a shipment than divert it.""
Pay is at the heart of the dispute between the port's Chinese owners Hutchison and the union Unite, which represents about 1,900 of the port's 2,500 or so workers.
rt has offered an increase of 7% plus £500 backdated to 1 January 2022. 
Unite claims with inflation currently running at about 10%, the offer is effectively a pay cut.
At the start of September, the port said negotiations had broken down and it would introduce its pay award without union agreement.
ght-day strike, which ended at 06:59 BST on Wednesday, followed another eight days of industrial action in August.
Unite said although further industrial action had not yet been called for at Felixstowe, it was ""likely"" unless the port changed its current position regarding the pay offer.

entertainment	Owain Wyn Evans: Wales first for new BBC Radio 2 show	"Presenter Owain Wyn Evans will host the new early breakfast show on BBC Radio 2 from Cardiff. 
w will be the first Radio 2 weekday programme to move out of London.
w will come from the BBC Cymru Wales broadcast centre from January. 
Owain has taken over from Vanessa Feltz, who stepped down in July 2022, and he said: ""I can't wait to help kick start the day on early breakfast live from Cardiff"".
move forms part of the BBC's Across The UK plans, which the corporation said would allow it to ""better reflect, represent and serve all parts of the country"".
rogramme will be broadcast Monday to Friday, from 04:00 BST to 06:30.
Owain said: ""When I asked my parents for a pair of turntables and mixing desk from a DJ shop in Llanelli when I was 13, I never allowed myself to dream that one day I'd have my own show on Radio 2.""
He started working as a television and radio presenter when he was 18, beginning as a children's news presenter at BBC Wales, before moving to become a weather presenter across the UK.
A keen drummer since he was seven, he shot to international fame when, during lockdown in 2020, he produced a video of himself drumming to the BBC News theme tune, which was viewed tens of millions of times around the globe.
It was the springboard for the record-breaking 24-hour drumathon for Children in Need, which raised more than £3.8m, making it the most successful 24-hour challenge in the 41-year history of BBC Children in Need.
Helen Thomas, head of Radio 2, says: ""I'd like to welcome Owain to the Radio 2 family. 
""His deep connection with Wales is obvious and I'm delighted he will be broadcasting live from Cardiff every weekday morning.
""His warmth and wit make him the perfect host to set up the day for our listeners right across the country who have clearly and warmly taken him to their hearts each time he has presented in this slot."" 
Rhuanedd Richards, director of BBC Cymru Wales, said: ""I'm delighted that Radio 2 listeners will be starting their weekdays in Owain's company, live every weekday from BBC Wales' home in Cardiff's Central Square.
""Having started his career as a presenter here in Wales, it's wonderful news that he'll be taking to the airwaves from Cardiff, and waking listeners across the UK."""	/news/world-63134726
health	UK zoonotic research site left to deteriorate - MPs	"UK's main facility for dealing with viruses that jump from animals to humans has been left to ""deteriorate to an alarming extent,"" according to MPs.
Public Affairs Committee report cited ""inadequate management and under-investment"" at the site in Weybridge.
It said the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) had ""comprehensively failed in its historical management"" of the centre. 
Defra said work was already under way to upgrade the laboratories.
re is operated by the government's Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA). It is central to the UK's ability to control the outbreak of animal diseases and detect any emerging pathogens.
Public Accounts Committee found more than ""1,000 single points of failure"" at the Weybridge site. 
Its report said deterioration had left the laboratories ""continually vulnerable to a major breakdown"" which would severely impact the UK's ability to effectively respond to outbreaks. 
Some of the deadliest viruses on earth are ""zoonotic diseases"" that cross between species such as Covid-19, Sars or Ebola.
report said the risk to the UK of a zoonotic disease was ""real and the consequences can be devastating"", and accused the government of not sufficiently prioritising this threat to ""UK health, trade, farming and rural communities.""
Committee chairwoman Dame Meg Hillier said: ""After the 2001 disaster of foot and mouth disease, the past decades have brought one animal-sourced disease after another. 
""It is shocking that government has allowed UK capacity in this area to deteriorate so alarmingly over that same period,"" she said. ""These diseases are devastating for our food production systems, the economy and, when they jump the species barrier to humans as Covid-19 did, to our whole society.""
UK and EU are currently in the grip of a record avian flu outbreak that has led to the culling of 48 million birds.
Prof Paul Wigley, professor of animal microbial ecosystems at the University of Bristol, warned that avian flu ""had the potential to jump to other species including us.""
""Weybridge has always been a central resource of facilities and people. It has been placed in a perilous position by underfunding and crumbling facilities,"" he said. ""Without support it is increasingly unlikely the UK could cope with another major outbreak of animal or zoonotic disease along with the ongoing avian influenza epidemic.""
government has plans to redevelop the site, with the construction of a new science hub due to start in 2027. However the level of funding needed is still not finalised.
Prof James Wood, head of the department of veterinary medicine at University of Cambridge, said that the ""steady decline"" of the facility had been clear. 
""We can no longer be reliant on laboratory resources from partner European laboratories. The significance of laboratories is demonstrated clearly by their central role in the diagnosis and control of the ongoing unprecedented avian influenza outbreak.
""The current major Weybridge redevelopment programme is very welcome and important but it will take many years to be implemented and there are risks of laboratory failure occurring in the meantime.""
A Defra spokesperson said: ""Significant funding and work is already underway to upgrade (Weybridge's) laboratories and ensure we are protected from these diseases into the future.
""Its world-leading scientists and our field teams are playing a vital role in responding rapidly and decisively to the threats from animal diseases, including the current Avian Influenza outbreak, which is the largest on record.""

business	Firms say government price cut plan 'slap in face'	"A new government campaign asking businesses to cut prices to help with living costs has been branded a ""slap in the face"" for small firms.
Federation of Small Businesses said asking struggling companies to ""soak up additional costs just isn't realistic"".
It's one of a number of groups who have criticised the plan for a taxpayer-funded ad campaign which involves firms slashing product prices from July.
government will be rolling out an official name with branding ""shortly"".
David Buttress, the government's new cost of living tsar, has proposed the ad campaign, but a government source told the BBC that businesses will not be handed any subsidies or funding in order to cut prices.
Martin McTague, national chair of the FSB, said most small firms were ""well beyond the point of being able to absorb extra costs without passing them on, which is often a last resort"".
""It's a slap in the face for government to spend the extra tax it is raising from businesses on state-run marketing campaigns - doubtless focused on big businesses with corporate offers that can now be rebranded as helping the cost of living crisis, and so boost their sales,"" he told the BBC.
""Asking this group to soak up additional costs just isn't realistic, especially when so many are worried about basic survival, and have already cut all expenses, even necessary ones, to the bone.""
Mr McTague argued there was ""much more the government could do to help"", such as reducing VAT rates to lift more small firms out of business rates, ""rather than just a marketing campaign using taxpayer resources to put government branding in shop windows"".
In response, the government said bringing in Mr Buttress on an unpaid basis was ""the latest step taken by the government to ensure we're doing everything we can to help people in this country with the rising cost of living"".
""He will work in partnership with the private sector to identify, develop and promote new and existing business-led initiatives that support people by encouraging businesses to do more to highlight discounted prices or product offers,"" a spokesperson said.
Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years, with UK inflation - the rate at which prices increase - at 9.1%, the highest since March 1982. It is pushing people to cut back on food shopping and car journeys, due to record-high fuel prices, to save money.
f Wetherspoons, Tim Martin, said the campaign proposal was a ""classic example of tinkering, instigated by ministers who really don't understand money"".
""The main economic critique of this government is that it doesn't have an overarching plan, but just reacts to events, like a doctor who only treats symptoms, not the cause,"" he added.
Mr Martin, a vocal supporter of Brexit, said eliminating tariffs on non-EU imports ""such as bananas, rice, coffee and children's clothes and shoes"" would ""immediately reduce shop prices and inflation"".
British Independent Retailers Association (Bira) said asking small retailers to reduce prices was a ""flawed idea"".
""Supply chain inflation has been ahead of consumer inflation for some time, and as a result independent retailers have been operating on reduced margins by suppressing the retail prices,"" said Bira chief executive Andrew Goodacre.
""We believe that government intervention is needed to reduce prices and stimulate demand, and the best way is to reduce VAT,"" he added.
Meanwhile, Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry body UK Hospitality, said bars, hotels and restaurants were ""already highly price competitive"" while it was also facing ""colossal input costs that make price reductions extremely difficult"".
""Energy costs are up 74%, goods 55% and labour up 54%, for example,"" she said. ""While government efforts to help consumers are always welcome, the reality is that just one in three hospitality businesses are now profitable.""
In 2020, the government launched the ""Eat Out To Help Out"" scheme to support hospitality businesses - where diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to £10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays for a limited period.
government provided funding to the hospitality businesses during this period to fund the discount.
Duncan Brewer, a partner in EY-Parthenon's consumer products and retail team, said price was ""the single most important factor in how customers choose where they shop"", adding retailers were ""working exceptionally hard to give their customers the lowest prices possible"".
""They will be aware that raising prices by more than is absolutely necessary to keep their businesses afloat at this time is a real risk,"" he added.
Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, added many retailers were expanding their value ranges to keep the price of ""essentials down and introducing discounts for vulnerable groups"".
CBI, which hosted Mr Buttress' speech, said it was ""vital the government continues to focus on building business confidence"" to help firms reduce the knock-on effects to consumers. 
""Business will continue to work in partnership with the government to try and mitigate the impact of rising costs across the board,"" a spokesman added."	/news/business-61965785
politics	Suella Braverman: We have failed to control our borders	"Suella Braverman blames the ""people smugglers"" and ""people coming here illegally"" over Channel boats crossings.
Home Secretary Suella Braverman has admitted the UK government has failed to control its borders, blaming migrants and people smugglers for chaos at Kent's Manston processing centre. 
However, she also said the Home Office needed to improve its efficiency.
MPs heard the home secretary had been warned four times keeping migrants at Manston may be breaking the law.
Previous reports suggested Ms Braverman was told failing to provide alternative accommodation was in breach of the law.
Ms Braverman told the Home Affairs Select Committee she would not comment on leaked documents. 
However, she said she was aware from September Manston had a problem.
During the committee session, Ms Braverman struggled to reply to a question from Conservative MP Tim Loughton who asked what legal routes were available to refugees who are not part of the Ukraine, Hong Kong or Afghanistan relocation schemes. 
""If you are able to get to the UK, you're able to put in an application for asylum,"" said Ms Braverman. 
Mr Loughton responded that for some refugees, illegal entry was the only way to get to the UK. 
""I think the point is that there's a shortage of safe and legal routes other than for specific groups of people,"" he said.
What safe and legal routes are there to the UK?
Manston was designed as a holding site for a maximum of 1,600 migrants who arrive on small boats - each for a maximum of 24 hours - but at its peak there were 4,000 people there. 
In October, inspectors found families who had been sleeping on mats in the marquees for weeks. 
A man who became unwell while staying at the centre died in hospital on Saturday. He is believed to have crossed to the UK in a small boat earlier in November, and Home Office staff are trying to contact his family. 
On Tuesday, the Home Office confirmed the site had been cleared, helped by bad weather in the English Channel causing a sustained fall in the number of crossings.
Delays in processing asylum claims are taking their toll on refugees' mental health. 
Ubed, an Iraqi Kurd, arrived in the UK by boat 17 months ago with his wife and daughter and claimed asylum in the first few months, but has heard nothing since. 
family is living in one room in a Wakefield hostel while they wait for a Home Office response to their case. 
""When I first came to the UK I was happy. I arrived and felt safe. Since that time it's got worse. My mental health and my family's mental health is degrading,"" Ubed told the BBC.
Dame Diana Johnson, who chairs the select committee, said Ms Braverman was told on 15 and 22 September and 1 and 4 October that the Home Office did not have the power to detain migrants waiting for onward accommodation.
mmittee heard that 36 people who had been held in Manston had been returned to Albania, under the government's agreement to return migrants and offenders.
ut of 12,000 Albanians arriving in the UK this year, up from 800 last year and 50 in 2020, according to official figures. 
Dan O'Mahoney, the Home Office's clandestine channel threat commander, also said there was one Albanian police officer working with officials at the Kent camp.
ry MP Lee Anderson told Ms Braverman more asylum seekers are being housed in hotels because ""the Home Office has failed to control our borders and it's not fit for purpose at the moment"". 
Ms Braverman said: ""We have failed to control our borders, yes, and that's why the prime minister and myself are absolutely determined to fix this problem.""
Earlier Ms Braverman told MPs: ""I am very clear who's at fault. 
""It's the people coming here illegally, people smugglers, people who are choosing to take an illegal and dangerous journey to come here for economic reasons.""
me secretary is aiming to quadruple the rate at which asylum cases are processed by staff as the government attempts to tackle the backlog in the system.
Ms Braverman told the committee that, on average, each staff member was deciding one asylum case per week at present.
Home Office has doubled the number of asylum staff to more than 1,000 and plans to recruit another 500 decision-makers by March.
Ms Braverman said: ""We want to deliver sustainable changes to reach a minimum of three decisions, per decision maker, per week by May."" 
mbition is four decisions per week, she added.
Ms Braverman was also pushed by MPs on the government's policy to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda in a bid to reduce the numbers crossing the Channel. 
, under which the UK has paid Rwanda £140m, is currently on hold as it faces a legal challenge in the court. 
me secretary insisted she still had confidence in the scheme and believed the courts would rule it to be legal.
Matthew Rycroft, the most senior civil servant in the Home Office, said it did not yet have evidence the scheme would be value for money. 
Responding to the issue of the lack of safe and legal routes into the UK, a Home Office official said the UK had offered asylum to more than 380,000 people since 2015, including those from Hong Kong, Syria, Afghanistan and Ukraine. 
fficial outlined other legal routes for people from other countries. 
""Our UK Resettlement, Community Sponsorship and Mandate schemes are accessible to refugees who have been assessed for resettlement by the UNHCR, and we do not seek to influence which cases are referred to us,"" said a statement."	/news/uk-politics-63730054

sports	Proscovia Peace: Netball has provided meaning to Uganda captain's life	"From playing barefoot, surviving being poisoned and growing up in a country that discouraged women's sports, netball has helped provide meaning to Proscovia Peace's life.
As the Uganda captain prepares to lead her side in a three-match series against England, she has been reflecting on her journey. 
Avoiding teenage pregnancy and marriage, which friends as young as 12 were forced into, were among the early challenges she faced.
""I witnessed it with my own eyes - at that stage I feared for my life - but what made me get through was determination,"" she told the BBC World Service.
""Even now, teenage pregnancy in Uganda is at the peak. That shows me that most of them can't see any future ahead and they are forced into situations like this.""
Peace grew up in the Arua District in north-west Uganda, where playing netball eventually provided her salvation - even if her early years playing the sport were not easy.
""The situations under which we trained were horrible, and we never had a proper netball,"" the 32-year-old said.
""We made netballs out of shopping bags, and we went into the forest to get sticks to implant as a [goal] post, before tying a rope around it.
""And all this training we were doing, there were no shoes. If you look at my leg you'll see so many scars. Every time people ask why I have so many scars, I tell them every single scar can tell a big story - it is what has made me.
""All this was my struggle in my career, trying to make it to a higher level, because the conditions were not conducive. I learned that situations like that never define who you are. It is how you go through those situations that make who you are. 
""Many branched off along the road. I continued, and that's why I am here today.""
Peace played netball at school and was identified as a talented athlete by a PE teacher, but her father refused to allow her to move to Kampala - Uganda's capital city - to study at university and pursue a netball career.
""Later on, I stopped blaming my father, simply because he never knew the benefit of sport,"" she said.
""He was born in a broken family, and did not know anything. He wanted the best for his daughter, but he could not afford it.
""There are many families like that, where people don't even have TV or radio to hear anything to do with sports. Plus there was nobody like an icon for us to see.
""It was not until I left that people in my community now know that netball benefits, and that sports can develop somebody.""
But she almost never made it when, having left town against her father's wishes, Peace was poisoned on a bus.
""A stranger gave me a piece of sweet, and when somebody gives you something, you accept it,"" she ventured. ""You just think this is a normal traveller. So when I ate it, that was when I started passing blood, and my tummy was aching.
""There are instances like that in the past when somebody would just randomly, maliciously, give somebody poison. A few children have died. I survived. How I made it, I don't know. 
""I blacked out because I lost a lot of blood. A friend came to help and got me to hospital, and that's how I survived - through her, not me.
""I believe there was a stronger power that ran to my rescue when I couldn't rescue myself.""
After recovering, Peace established herself one of the best goal shooters in the world, and became the first African to play in the UK's Super League when she appeared for Loughborough Lightning in 2015.
She has helped Uganda's She Cranes rise to sixth in the world ranking before next year's Netball World Cup in Cape Town, South Africa, and is eager to be a role model for girls across the continent. 
""I am humbled to be that person that somebody can look up to,"" she said.
""I have always strongly believed it's not the trophies that I get, but the impact I have left in the lives of other people that is a legacy.
""Being able to inspire other people is what fulfils my joy, because it's my responsibility to show the way to somebody else and make them a better person.
""Netball has the power to empower somebody. So many people think a sport like netball doesn't benefit [you], but if I count my blessings, netball is number one on it.
""Netball has given me what money would never buy. You may not see it in material forms, but the things that it has done; giving education, making you explore, giving you family, empowering you to be the voice of the voiceless. Those are some of the greatest achievements that money cannot buy.""
Peace is now on good terms with her father, who she describes as a ""beautiful man"", and her success in her netball career has allowed her to provide a house for him to live in.
""Getting to know my father's story humbled me,"" she added.
""He's called recently to tell me 'I don't deserve to get anything from you because of the way you were brought up. But you brushed off everything and built a roof above me'.
""I used the money from netball to build him a house, and to make him sleep under a beautiful roof, and that humbled him the more. That house looks like an icon to everybody in the community that this is what netball can do, and he is grateful for it.
""He keeps telling people 'Every child is a human being; treasure them, respect their decisions, and give them the opportunity to do what they can do'.
""I think everything happens for a reason. I am grateful he is my father. It doesn't matter what happened. He is my father and I forgive him a long time ago.
""I love with him with the whole of my heart, because if he didn't love me he would have dealt with me when I was a child, and I was helpless. But he preserved my life, kept me to this stage, so for that reason I am grateful."""	/sport/africa/63130299
politics	Suella Braverman email could throw fresh doubt over security breach claims	"An email sent from Suella Braverman's personal account on the day she had to resign over a security breach could throw fresh doubt over her claims about the speed with which she took action.
mail, seen by the BBC, told the recipient of a highly sensitive message that Ms Braverman had sent in error to ""delete and ignore"" it.
She has said she reported the mistake ""rapidly"" to officials.
But the BBC understands it took hours for her to respond.
Ms Braverman quit as home secretary 10 days ago because she had breached security rules relating to email use. She was then reappointed by new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.
Her reappointment has drawn criticism, with calls for an inquiry and Labour demanding Mr Sunak ""comes clean"" and releases assessments of the security breach.
In her defence, the home secretary said ""as soon as I realised my mistake I rapidly reported this on official channels"". She said she reported it to the cabinet secretary - the head of the civil service.
But the BBC understands she sent the original email from her personal Gmail account to the wrong person, a member of parliamentary staff, at 7:25 BST on 19 October. 
ument was a draft written ministerial statement related to immigration visas containing highly sensitive information about government policy.  
At 8:30 the recipient sent her a message saying that it had been sent in error. 
At 10:02 a message was then sent from the home secretary's personal Gmail account saying: ""Please can you delete the message and ignore"". 
It is understood the chief whip at the time, Wendy Morton, was told what had happened around half an hour later by the office that had received the message in error. Ms Morton then urgently tried to track down the home secretary to discuss the issue, it is understood.
One source told the BBC there was no evidence that Ms Braverman had raised the incident herself before she was confronted with the mistake later that afternoon, and subsequently had to resign.  
But a source close to Ms Braverman said around 12:00, she instructed officials to raise the breach with the cabinet secretary. That is still more than four hours after her original email that broke the rules and two hours after she had asked the recipient to ""delete and ignore"".
""The home secretary has been clear that once she realised she'd made this error of judgment she proactively reported it on official channels. 
""These events need to be seen in the context of a very packed schedule. She recognises she made a mistake, apologised and offered her resignation to the PM,"" the source said.
Ms Braverman had sent the document to her own Gmail address, before sending it on. Ministers are not permitted to send government documents to personal accounts, or to share further. 
Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove told the BBC he was glad the prime minister had given Ms Braverman ""a second chance"", describing her as ""a first-rate"" politician.
Asked about the home secretary's email, he said ""I am sure there are lots of inferences that can be drawn"" but added it would be inappropriate to ""rush to judgement"".
He said it would have been ""quite proper"" for the home secretary to ask the recipient to delete and ignore the message. ""That is standard practice,"" he said.
WATCH: I am satisfied Braverman coming back was right - Gove
Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper accused Mr Gove of ""badly minimising issues around national security"".
She argued that the email added ""to the serious list of questions that we now have about the reckless reappointment of Suella Braverman to be home secretary... it goes to the heart of Rishi Sunak's error of judgment.""
Ms Cooper has also said her party ""will use every parliamentary mechanism open to force government to come clean over her reappointment, to get answers and to require detailed documents to be released to the Intelligence and Security Committee"".
Meanwhile, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said Ms Braverman's appointment has undermined the prime minister's promise to have integrity ""at every level of his government. ""He has failed at the first hurdle,"" Ms Lucas said. 
Some Tory MPs have also expressed concern. Backbench MP Caroline Nokes previously backed opposition calls for an inquiry and former Tory chairman Sir Jake Berry described the breach as ""really serious"".

sports	Heineken Champions Cup: Five things we learned from opening weekend	"Twelve games played, 599 points scored and three new teams all made for a compelling start to the 2022-23 Heineken Champions Cup.
Eight sides from England, eight from France, three from Ireland and one each from Scotland and Wales were joined by three newcomers from South Africa in a new-look premier club competition - so what are the key talking points from the opening weekend?
BBC Sport takes a look at five things we learned.
re was a lot of noise around Leicester Tigers boss Steve Borthwick this weekend as he is among the favourites to replace Eddie Jones as the England head coach.
But the former lock was quick to shut down any suggestion of such a move in his pre-match news conference on Friday, and that message was conveyed to his players against Ospreys.
Anthony Watson's stunning solo try saw Leicester come from behind to earn a 23-17 win against Ospreys in Swansea.
Nicky Smith's try had given the hosts the lead before Harry Potter and Watson handed Tigers victory, despite Morgan Morris' late consolation try. The result means the two-year wait for a Welsh win in Europe's top tier competition goes on.
Speaking after the game, Borthwick said he was ""fully focused"" on facing Clermont next week - it remains to be seen whether he will still be in charge by then?
Arguably the headline of this year's tournament is the introduction of South African teams the Sharks, Stormers and Bulls.
Cell C Sharks were the first to make their bow in the formerly all-European competition with a 39-31 bonus-point win over Premiership side Harlequins in Durban.
Josh Bassett's second try got Quins to within one point of victory with five minutes remaining but Boeta Chamberlain scored to seal the win and take a losing bonus point away from the visitors, after earlier tries for the hosts from Bongi Mbonambi, Werner Kok and two from Makazole Mapimpi.
Andre Esterhuizen - a former Sharks player - scored two tries for Quins but that was only enough to secure a four-try bonus point.
Stormers lost 24-14 at French side and three-time runners-up Clermont Auvergne, while the Bulls beat Lyon 42-36 in Pretoria.
ree-time winners Saracens, who made their return to the competition after a two-season hiatus, had to come from behind to earn a 30-26 bonus point win over Edinburgh on Sunday.
Premiership leaders, who have won their opening nine league games of the season, went behind early on as their Scottish visitors played with intent.
Edinburgh scored the opening try through Luan de Bruin, before Elliot Daly crossed for the hosts. Ben Earl, Alex Lewington and Tom Woolstencroft all crossed to secure the bonus point for the hosts at the StoneX Stadium, while Wes Goosen's late try earned a losing bonus for Edinburgh. 
Sale Sharks continued their momentum after three league wins with a comfortable win over Ulster in the early game on Sunday, scoring six tries to claim a 39-0 bonus-point win at the AJ Bell Stadium.
Ulster's preparation for the game was disrupted by the cold weather in the north west of England, which meant they had to travel on the morning of the game after their flight on Saturday was cancelled.
Perhaps the visitors were sluggish from their disrupted schedule, but tries from Tom Curry, Dan du Preez, Rob du Preez, Tom Curtis, Byron McGuigan and Arron Reed led to a comfortable home win.
Holders La Rochelle began the defence of their crown with a thumping 46-12 bonus-point win over Northampton Saints.
French side have been in indifferent form with three defeats in their past five matches but they took control against Saints as first-half tries by Brice Dulin, Pierre Bourgarit, Pierre Boudehent and Dillyn Leyds wrapped up the bonus.
Gregory Alldritt charged down a clearance to score a fifth try before Ulupano Seuteni added a sixth.
re was some positivity for Saints, who welcomed back England forward Courtney Lawes for the first time in two months off the bench, before James Ramm and Matt Proctor scored consolation tries.
Next up for the holders is a trip to Ulster.
Injury to Leinster's Johnny Sexton prevented the latest instalment in the battle of the 10s between the Irishman and Scotland's Finn Russell.
Ross Byrne stepped in to replace Sexton at fly-half for the four-time winners as they dominated three-time runners-up Racing 92 to secure a 42-10 bonus-point away win.
Josh van der Flier was named men's player of the year at the World Rugby Awards last month, and his year just keeps getting better as he scored two tries in France, while Andrew Porter, Dan Sheehan, Garry Ringrose and Ed Byrne also crossed for the visitors.
Russell was limited to just five points from the boot, including a conversion for Christian Wade's try, as the disciplined Leinster defence prevented him from pulling the strings in midfield."	/sport/rugby-union/63938350
politics	Liz Truss and Boris Johnson join Tory wind farm rebellion	"Boris Johnson and Liz Truss are backing an attempt to overturn England's effective ban on onshore wind farms, a Conservative MP has said.
Former minister Simon Clarke said the ex-prime ministers were supporting his bid to relax restrictions through the Levelling Up Bill.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has scrapped a move by predecessor Ms Truss to relax the rules.
He has said he wants to prioritise building turbines offshore instead.
Mr Clarke has tabled an amendment to the Levelling Up Bill that would overturn a planning clampdown introduced by former PM David Cameron in 2015.
A spokesman for Mr Johnson has confirmed to the BBC he supports the amendment. Ms Truss has been approached for comment. 
In a tweet, Mr Clarke - who was levelling up secretary under Ms Truss - said his amendment had found support ""right across the Conservative Party"".
move would allow new turbines with local consent, and represented a ""pro-growth, pro-green policy at a time when we need both,"" he added.
It is the latest rebellion faced by Mr Sunak over the Levelling-Up Bill's planning measures.
's journey through Parliament has already been delayed by a Tory backbench rebellion over housing targets, with votes due next Monday postponed.
When he was prime minister, Mr Johnson published an energy strategy in May that ruled out ""wholesale changes"" to the planning system for onshore wind.
It said the government would consult a ""limited number of supportive communities"" about allowing new turbines in exchange for lower energy bills.
Earlier this month, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would lift the ban if it wins power at the next general election, which is expected to take place in 2024.
Labour's proposed planning changes include removing a provision that allows a single person's objection to stop an application.
Sir Keir said not backing onshore wind was a ""national act of self-harm, choking off our economic potential"".
Asked about the ban earlier this month, Mr Sunak told MPs the government wanted to focus on offshore rather than onshore wind.
""It is right that we bring people with us as we transition to net zero,"" he said. 
""The worst thing we can do is alienate communities if we want to actually deliver on our climate commitments."""	/news/uk-politics-63750925
politics	PMQs: Sunak quizzed on access to NHS services and his wealth	"Rishi Sunak said the government had put record funding into the NHS to help with backlogs after he was challenged over current NHS services. 
Labour MP Karl Turner had asked him if he, or members of his household, became ill would he endure lengthy waiting times to see be seen, or pay to see someone privately ""there and then.""
Mr Sunak responded by saying Mr Turner was right to highlight the issue of people waiting unacceptably long times for treatment.
""I want to make sure everyone gets the care they need and we will continue to invest in more doctors, more nurses and community scans to deliver exactly that,"" the prime minister said.

politics	Chris Heaton-Harris says DUP have a 'choice' over early election	"Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris has said the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has a ""choice"" to prevent an early Stormont election. 
Speaking to Sky News, he called on the party to re-enter devolved government.
Stormont ministers lost much of their powers in February due to a DUP protest over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Mr Heaton-Harris has repeatedly said he will call an election if the Stormont executive is not fully restored by 00:01 on 28 October. 
""The Democratic Unionist Party have got an opportunity to come back in,"" he told the Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme. 
""It's really important, I think, that they do because there are so many domestic issues in Northern Ireland that would be helped by their re-entering into the executive.
""They've got some really talented politicians themselves who can help sort those issues out.
""There is a choice that people can make to stop an election happening but it has got to be made by elected representatives in Northern Ireland going back into the assembly.""
Mr Heaton-Harris has publicly backed Boris Johnson to return to Downing Street as prime minister, as the race to replace Liz Truss continues.
However, his colleague in the Northern Ireland Office (NIO), Steve Baker, said Mr Johnson would be a ""guaranteed disaster"" and confirmed he is supporting the former chancellor Rishi Sunak.
""I'm not willing to lay down my integrity for Boris Johnson,"" Mr Baker said. 
""If Boris is in charge, his premiership will implode and we'll be back here.""
Analysis by BBC News NI political correspondent Darran Marshall
wo Northern Ireland ministers, both former ERG chairmen, endorse two different candidates for the top job. 
Chris Heaton-Harris was Boris Johnson's chief whip and says his old boss has a proven track record.
His rival for the job, Rishi Sunak, has managed to win the backing of Julian Smith, Simon Hoare, Lord Frost, and now Steve Baker. Those four men rarely agree on much these days.
Baker's endorsement seems significant - it shows Sunak has the ability to win over hard-line Brexiteers.
Heaton-Harris and Baker took to the airwaves to give full throttle endorsements of their candidates.
But then both took to Twitter for a political love-in.
Mr Baker warned prime ministerial candidates that they must stick to the government's current course on the Northern Ireland Protocol if they wanted to stay in power. 
""Irrespective of what I think, those Eurosceptic colleagues who I know and love like brothers and sisters will absolutely not tolerate any divergence from what we've said we are going to do,"" he said. 
""Look at the recent past. It doesn't matter whether people like it or not - they will do what they will do and they will bring down any prime minister who doesn't do what they say they will do.""
Mr Baker said he had spoken to Mr Sunak three times in the past 24 hours.
He said he was ""absolutely not concerned that Rishi will follow through"" with plans to implement the Northern Ireland Protocol in its current state.
""The same policy must be carried forward,"" said Mr Baker.
""I'm very pleased that (chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs committee) Simon Hoare and I have united on this point.
""Everyone needs to understand that the legitimate interest of unionists is to end the jurisdiction of EU law in Northern Ireland.
""We will not have devolved government in Northern Ireland until it is done.
""That means we will not be celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement - this is big stuff.""
He added: ""We can offer friendship and humility and apologies when they're needed but in the end, we've got to end the jurisdiction of EU law in Northern Ireland."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63363511
health	Liskeard swab rally for teen who needs bone marrow transplant	"family of a teenager who has a rare blood disorder are hoping a pop-up testing facility will find a suitable donor.
Charlie Dugdale, 17, from Liskeard, Cornwall, has aplastic anaemia, where the bone marrow and stem cells do not produce enough blood cells.
As a result, he needs a bone marrow transplant.
wab rally took place on Saturday, at Liskeard Town Hall, between 09:30 and 16:00 GMT.
Danielle Dugdale, Charlie's mother, said before the event: ""We're asking, encouraging and begging people to come along if they would like to help, and potentially help to save our son's life.""
Charlie had just qualified as a chef in the Royal Navy and was about to start his submarine training when he was diagnosed with the condition.
Ms Dugdale told BBC Radio Cornwall their ""life [was] turned upside down"" after he was admitted to Derriford Hospital on 31 October.
""The only form of treatment that has been discussed is bone marrow transplant, so his brothers have been tested and we are waiting for their results but there is only a one in four chance.
""We don't have time to wait. Charlie wants to get better.""
She said: ""A bone marrow swab is a swab of the cheek. A quick mouth swab. That gets sent off and it will tell you if that is a match and then you can go on to further investigations.""
Henny Braund, who is from the Anthony Nolan Trust, said: ""Charlie has mixed heritage, it's really important that we get people with ethnic minority background.
""If you come up with a match, you need to have three injections to stimulate your stem cells, then you would need to go into hospital for about four hours and give your stem cells, like giving blood.
""It's a very simple process and after those four hours you're free to go, and in the process you're giving someone like Charlie a second chance of life.""
Dani Thomas attended the swab rally and said: ""The weather's horrible but it's great that people have still made an effort to come out today to get tested and try and do their bit to help. 
""As a mum I would wish anybody would come and help me if it was my child,"" she added.

business	Rising costs leave Albrighton independent shops in limbo	"Independent shops in a Shropshire village say they are ""in limbo"" as energy bills spiral.
Village Butcher, in Albrighton, is the high street's first casualty - it closed after its electricity bills more than doubled from £15,000 to £35,000.
Businesses are not covered by an energy price cap, now £3,549 for households, and many face cost pressures.
In Albrighton, business owners told the BBC they were concerned about raising their prices and losing customers.
""If I put my bills up, am I going to lose clients?,"" asked Helen Pickering from Nieve Ella's hair salon at the top of High Street.
""A lot of my customers are the older generation and it's horrible that they can't afford to have their hair done,"" she said. 
""If I can keep my prices the same, and keep my clients coming in, at least then I will have money coming in to pay my bills.""
Next door to Village Butcher is Number Seven Boutique. Amanda Potter, who runs it, is worried about the winter months.
""A lot of people went on holiday this summer and they wanted to buy new clothing. That might not be the case next year,"" she said.
Unlike her neighbour the butcher, which needed to power freezers around the clock, the boutique is looking at options to reduce its energy use.
""We normally have lights on in the window and they never go off, but I'm now looking to buy a timer so the lights can be switched off early,"" Ms Potter said.
At the bottom of High Street is the Latte Da coffee shop. It is owned by Phil Taylor, who opened the café nine years ago. He is optimistic about surviving the tough times ahead.
""We managed to get through the pandemic and now we face the energy crisis,"" he said.
""We're all in limbo, unsure how much our bills will rise. We get a lot of support from local customers and we're trying to give them good value for money.""
Current Chancellor Nadim Zahawi said the government was working on proposals for the new prime minister to consider which would include support for businesses.

entertainment	K-pop star Jin from BTS begins military service	"Jin, the oldest member of K-pop mega-band BTS, has entered military service - the first of the group to do so.
30-year-old posted a photo of himself with his new military haircut before enlisting on Tuesday. ""It looks cuter than I expected,"" he said. 
As South Korea is still technically at war with its hostile neighbour North Korea, all able-bodied men are required to serve in the army.  
Jin has begun five weeks' training at a bootcamp near the North Korean border. 
After this, he will reportedly be assigned to a frontline unit. This news sent his millions of adoring fans into a frenzy.
So, what can Jin expect from his time on the frontline? 
At the Yeoncheon bootcamp, where Jin has enrolled, recruits sleep on mats on the floor, in rooms with 30 people. They are taught how to handle weapons and fire live ammunition before being put through demanding wartime scenarios.
Cadets told us that the most challenging tasks they faced were being sealed in a gas chamber, to experience the effects of CS gas, and having to detonate a live grenade. 
""I was pretty nervous to hold the grenade and shocked to learn how powerful it was,"" said 22-year-old Yang Su-yeon, who completed his training at Yeoncheon last year.
""It was physically demanding, but mentally it was okay. The drill sergeants were all friendly,"" Yang said. 
After training, Jin will reportedly be stationed near the North Korean border, with a frontline unit. 
North and South Korea are separated by a 4km (2.5-mile) wide strip of land, which runs along the length of their border, known as the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Both sides are fenced off with barbed wire and heavily armed.
Yang spent his service as an out-post guard at the DMZ, with the 5th Infantry Division, which is one of the most frontline positions. He would keep watch through the night, constantly surveying the North Korean soldiers on the other side, using thermal imaging equipment.
""A few times I saw the North Korean soldiers being beaten, either kicked or slapped in the face,"" he said. 
""They had to do manual labour because they didn't have nice equipment like us to help them.""
Yang said watching the North Korean soldiers made him feel grateful for his own experience. ""When I saw what they had to do, I realised, 'Wow, I am so much more comfortable.' I would feel sorry for them.""
But BTS's Jin will have to contend with the cold winter approaching. Yang recalled days spent shovelling snow as temperatures fell below -20C. 
""When we went outside, our eyelashes would freeze,"" he said.
Yang praised the culture of his unit: ""Because we carried guns loaded with ammunition, we had to remain calm, so there was no harassment or beatings.""
Yang volunteered to be deployed as a frontline guard, as this position comes with perks, including more time off base. 
It is more likely Jin will be sent to a base set further back from the DMZ, like 26-year-old Heo Sungyoung, who spent his service with the 6th Corps Command Centre from 2018 to 2020.
For the first six months he guarded the entrance to the command centre. 
""It was so long and boring. I had nothing to do but stare at the sky,"" Heo said. From there, he was moved on to the logistics team, where he was responsible for ordering supplies such as tissues and socks.
South Korea's compulsory military service is a source of grievance for many young men, who begrudge it for taking them away from their studies, work and friends. 
For months it was rumoured that the government might allow the members of BTS to skip the service, on the basis they had already served their country by earning it billions of dollars, and it would be more beneficial to allow them to carry on doing so.
But in October, the members of BTS announced they were all planning to enlist, with Jin, as the oldest, going first. 
Even so, the reports he was being sent to the front line surprised some fans, who had assumed he would be given a less risky role.
re used to be a special unit for celebrities, where they could continue to work as entertainers and were given privileges. But there was public outcry when some were found abusing the system, by leaving their barracks more often than allowed. In 2013, the two-tier system was abolished.
""If I said it didn't feel like a waste of time, I'd be lying,"" said Yang who was stationed at the guard post. ""If I had the choice again, I wouldn't do it. I could have learnt so much more in 18 months in the real world.
""My advice to Jin is to just bide his time and pray it passes quickly.""
But Heo, from the logistics team, had better memories. Initially he said he questioned, like many men in their 20s, why he needed to be there, but ended up learning some valuable lessons.
""At school, I had only mixed with people from the same background, but in the army, everyone was so different. I realised how much bigger and more diverse the world was.""
His advice for Jin is to enjoy this experience. ""As a top star, he will not have had much opportunity to meet normal people. This will be good for him, I think.""
Online, tens of thousands of fans have already messaged Jin to offer their own advice and tell him how terribly they will miss him.
""Please take care and bring enough warm clothes and medicine,"" wrote Maliah Leah. ""I hope your colleagues treat you well. We will be waiting patiently for your comeback."""	/news/world-asia-63944860
entertainment	Batman voice actor Kevin Conroy dies aged 66	"Kevin Conroy, who is best known for voicing Batman, has died aged 66.
He first played Bruce Wayne 30 years ago in Batman: The Animated Series and went on to appear in a number of TV shows, feature films and video games.
He also voiced the superhero in the video games Arkham Knight and Arkham City and also appeared in a 2019 episode of Batwoman.
His agent Steven Neibert told the BBC: ""The voiceover community lost one of the greats.
