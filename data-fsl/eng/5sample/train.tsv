politics	Rishi Sunak pledges more staff to help clear asylum backlog	"Chris Mason challenges Rishi Sunak over plans on processing asylum claims
Rishi Sunak has promised more staff to help clear the UK's backlog of asylum claims by the end of next year.
Downing Street later said the pledge was not to abolish current backlog of initial decisions - only claims made up to the end of June.
Under a plan unveiled by the prime minister, a dedicated unit of 400 specialists will be set up to handle claims from Albanians.
Refugee charities branded the plans ""cruel"" and ""ineffective"".
um backlog has ballooned in recent years, with 117,000 outstanding claims, relating to 143,377 people, who are waiting for an initial decision on their application and unable to work. Of these, nearly 100,000 people have been waiting more than six months. 
In the Commons, Mr Sunak said the government expected to ""abolish the backlog of initial asylum decisions by the end of next year"". 
rime minister's official spokesman later said this pledge only related to claims made before 28 June, when the Nationality and Borders Act came into force. He said this consists of 92,601 initial asylum claims.
Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Mr Sunak's pledge was ""already falling apart just hours after he made it"". 
With pressure building on the Home Office to tackle the issue, Mr Sunak has labelled the small boats crisis a priority for his premiership.
More than 40,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year - the highest number since figures began to be collected in 2018.
re has been a rapid increase in the number of Albanians crossing the Channel and this nationality now make up 35% of arrivals. 
Ministers have singled out Albanian migrants, accusing many of exploiting the system by pretending to be victims of modern slavery. 
Under the government's plans, asylum case workers will be given new guidance making it clear Albania is a safe country and requiring evidence of modern slavery when considering a claim.
As a result of the plans, Mr Sunak said the vast majority of claims from Albanians could be declared ""clearly unfounded"", which would see ""thousands"" returned home in the coming months. 
UK border officials will also be posted at Albania's main airport, under a new deal with the country.
r measures announced by Mr Sunak in the Commons include: 
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer dismissed the proposals as ""unworkable gimmicks"". 
While he welcomed the announcement of additional staff, he said there had so far been a ""total failure of any co-ordinated response"" to criminal trafficking gangs.
Labour MP Dame Diana Johnson, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, questioned whether there were enough staff to clear the backlog.
But in an interview with the BBC, Mr Sunak insisted tripling the productivity of staff was ""realistic"", by removing paperwork and streamlining asylum interviews.
rime minister's ambition to clear the backlog within a year will be welcomed by many, as will the resources to speed up claims, with a doubling in the number of caseworkers. But we have heard such promises before without seeing the results. 
Faster processing risks poorer decisions and more successful appeals. It is skilled and sensitive work.  
Currently, a caseworker makes fewer than two decisions a week, but the Home Office hopes to more than double that.
Recruiting and training staff will take time and resources. The home secretary had already announced an increase of 500 caseworkers by March next year but accepted that a 46% attrition rate meant this would only increase the total by around 300 to 1,300. 
It is also notable that the prime minister did not use his statement to respond to a renewed call today from his Migration Advisory Committee that asylum seekers be allowed to work. 
Mr Sunak also pledged to ""significantly raise the threshold someone has to meet"" to be considered a victim of modern slavery.
But former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May warned modern slavery was ""a very real and current threat"". 
She urged Mr Sunak not to ""diminish our world-leading protections for the victims of this terrible, horrific crime"". 
rime minister denied he was watering down the definition of modern slavery and told the BBC he wanted to stop the system being ""clogged up by people making spurious claims"". 
UN's refugee agency welcomed measures to address the asylum backlog but said plans to limit access to asylum to those arriving through ""safe, legal routes"" went against the principles of the 1951 Refugee Convention. 
UNHCR said the announcements marked ""a troubling step away"" from the UK's ""commendable humanitarian tradition"".
m Naor Hilton, chief executive of charity Refugee Action, criticised the government for failing to commit to creating new safe routes for people to come to the UK, which he said ""could end most small boat crossings overnight"". 
""Most of these changes are cruel, ineffective and unlawful and will do nothing to fix the real problems in the system,"" he said.
Refugee Council said treating people ""who come to the UK in search of safety as illegal criminals"" was ""deeply disturbing and flies in the face of international law"". 
rity said it was ""very simplistic"" to label Albania safe ""when in reality it has serious problems with criminal and sexual exploitation of women and children""."	/news/uk-politics-63959729
business	House price growth at 10% a year despite squeeze on finances	"UK house prices rose by 10% in the year to August, the Nationwide has said, despite pressure on buyers' budgets.
market still has greater demand from buyers than homes for sale, leading to a double-digit annual rise for the 10th consecutive month.
mortgage lender said the typical property price had risen by £50,000 in the past two years to £273,751.
However, the Nationwide said there were signs the market was cooling, as both energy costs and mortgage rates rise. 
ual growth in house prices did slow slightly last month, down from 11% in July, but the market remains tough for first-time buyers.
""Fast-rising rents are not offering any relief and could keep some buyers in the hunt for a home for longer than they would like,"" said Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor,
""Even though the housing market is slowing, it is nowhere near a crash. Strong demand for homes far outstripping available housing inventory means the housing market remains a difficult one for wannabe homeowners and those looking to climb up the property ladder.""
Nationwide is predicting that an increase in energy costs and rising mortgage interest rates will add to the pressure on household budgets in the coming months.
It suggested that the least energy efficient property could typically see bills surge by £2,700 a year, or £225 a month.
""There are signs that the housing market is losing some momentum,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist.
""We expect the market to slow further as pressure on household budgets intensifies in the coming quarters, with inflation set remain in double digits into next year. 
""Moreover, the Bank of England is widely expected to continue raising interest rates, which will also exert a cooling impact on the market if this feeds through to mortgage rates, which have already increased noticeably in recent months."""	/news/business-62751244

It comes as five projects have been awarded a share of a £165m UK government fund.
rojects will cut CO2 emissions by an average of 200,000 tonnes a year, once fully up and running.
Department of Transport said the project will also produce 300,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel a year. 
UK government said this was ""enough to fly to the moon and back about 60 times"" and equates to around 14,331,300 miles (23,063,991 km).
One of the projects will be based at Port Talbot steelworks and will convert steel mill off-gases into fuel.
Another scheme will develop a plant creating duel using carbon captured from a gas-fired power station and hydrogen made from renewable electricity.
r successful projects include sustainable fuel plants in Teesside, Immingham and Ellesmere Port, which will cover domestic and commercial waste. 
UK government Transport Secretary Mark Harper said: ""Using waste or by-products to refuel airliners sounds like a flight of fancy, but... it's going to help us make guilt-free flying a reality.
""It's exactly this kind of innovation that will help us create thousands of green jobs across the country and slash our carbon emissions."" 
A Welsh government spokesman called it ""great news"", adding: ""We are committed to helping create green jobs in the new industries of the future, which will help us deliver our ambition of creating a stronger, fairer and greener economy.

health	China Covid: Hospitals under strain in wave of infections	"China's hospitals are already under so much pressure, following the country's rapid 180-degree shift in Covid policy, that doctors and nurses could be infecting patients.
It seems frontline medical workers are being told to come in even if they have the virus themselves because of staff shortages.
A Chinese professor specialising in health policy has been monitoring the crisis in his home country from Yale University in the United States.
Chen Xi told the BBC that he has been speaking to hospital directors and other medical staff in China about the massive strains on the system right now.
""People who've been infected have been required to work in the hospitals which creates a transmission environment there,"" he said.
China's hospitals have hastily increased their fever ward capacity to meet a huge influx of patients, but these have been filling up quickly, in part because the message is still not getting through that it is all right to stay at home if you catch the virus.
Prof Chen says much more needs to be done to explain this to people.
""There is no culture of staying at home for minor symptoms,"" he said. ""When people feel sick they all go to hospitals, which may easily crash the healthcare system.""
A rush on pharmacies has led to significant nationwide shortages of medicine used to treat a cold or the flu. Home testing kits for Covid are also hard to come by.
In Beijing, though restaurants are allowed to open again, they have very few customers and the streets are quiet.
Companies are telling employees they should return to the office, but many don't want to.
makes sense when you consider that, just weeks ago, the government was saying that there will be no swerving from zero-Covid, that those infected must go to centralised quarantine facilities and that lockdowns were necessary.
ronavirus was something to fear and Chinese people were lucky to live here because the Communist Party would not sacrifice them on the altar of opening up.
Now the goal of returning each outbreak to zero cases has been abandoned, Covid is spreading like wildfire and the line from the government is that catching this disease is not something to worry about.
China's easing of Covid restrictions was expected to unfold more slowly, much more gradually.
me street protests, in city after city, with demonstrators demanding their old lives back. They wanted to be free to move around again. There were clashes with police and the chant was going up for China's leader Xi Jinping to resign and for the Communist Party to give up power.
was the straw that broke zero-Covid's back.
According to Prof Chen, this meant that the timing of China's re-opening was ""not ideal"" but they had to do it.
He said countries like Singapore and New Zealand made their changes when infections were at bay. However, China has moved with full-blown outbreaks under way in cities like Beijing.
government ""heard the voice of the protesters"", he said, but added that this was not the ideal choice for them in terms of timing.
So the protesters may have won, but the speed of the cave-in from the government has left elderly people afraid to leave their homes.
One woman we met going for a walk with her grandson said she would stay clear of crowded places, that she would keep wearing a mask and continue to wash her hands regularly.
Yet a reluctance to be in places where infection is more likely permeates all groups in society. 
mpact on Beijing has been great.
Another reason restaurants are empty is that the city government still requires a negative PCR test result within 48 hours to dine inside. However, the majority of results are not coming through to health code phone apps. 
ms to be because the labs have been swamped with work now that Covid is spreading so rapidly.
A 34-year-old woman, who is isolating at home after catching Covid, told the BBC that the experience, so far, has been surprisingly smooth.
She said her symptoms have not been as bad as she had expected them to be and that she has everything she needs.
She also said she was much happier to have the option of recovering at home with her husband rather than in a crowded quarantine centre.
However, she too worries. She has a sister with young children, parents living alone in their hometown and a grandmother who all have to get through this period.
Doctors are taking to social media in an attempt reassure people that it is fine for them to remain at home after they catch Covid.
Officials have also started to transform China's Covid isolation centres into temporary hospital facilities, to cope with an explosion of infections. 
In just one day this week, 22,000 people in Beijing tried to get into a fever clinic.
Questions are being asked. 
Why didn't the government prepare for this earlier, with an expansion of hospital ICU capacity?
Why has it taken so long to make this switch when countries around the world had already done it?
Why did Xi Jinping's administration allow the zero-Covid approach to cause so much damage to the economy more broadly and people's livelihoods more specifically?
A renewed vaccination push has started but it too should have come before China reached this stage.
government says it is the virus which has changed, that newer strains are less dangerous and that this has meant the time was right to alter the response.
Either way, there is much more optimism now.
A group of overseas Chinese have set up a special chat on the Wechat app so that people living in other countries can share their experiences of having Covid with users in China.
goal is simple. Calm nerves. 
For sure, the next couple of months are going to be tough here. Millions of people are going to get sick and there will be many deaths.
However, the old approach was clearly unsustainable and, at last, people can see a way out."	/news/world-asia-china-63944861
health	Bournemouth: Anti-abortion group take action against clinic buffer zone	"An anti-abortion group is taking legal action over a clinic buffer zone, claiming it censors free speech and criminalises reading from the Bible.
Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council is being taken to court for introducing the zone to protect staff and visitors from protests.
Christian Concern said the council's consultation held prior to its introduction was ""questionable"". 
BCP Council said it was seeking legal advice and considering its position.
Supported by the Christian Legal Centre, the group said the 492ft (150m) buffer zone around the British Pregnancy Advisory Group's (BPAS) clinic in Ophir Road in Bournemouth, makes prayer illegal. 
group said the zone had ""essentially criminalised"" volunteer members of 40 Days for Life for offering help and support within the area. 
It said ""sprinkling 'holy water' in the zone, could lead to a volunteer facing six months in prison"".
It said it would pursue a statutory review of the council's decision to ""force through a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) in October following a questionable public consultation."" 
Its lawyers will argue that whilst the council actively engaged with BPAS during the consultation, it did not consult with any anti-abortion group, including 40 Days for Life.
It said its lawyers will also argue that the PSPO is disproportionate and will ask the High Court to declare the PSPO is ""unlawful, unjustified and an interference with pro-lifers' rights"".
In October MPs voted for an amendment to the Public Order Bill which will impose buffer zones around all abortion clinics in England and Wales.
But the group cited the position of Minister for Women, Maria Caulfield, who voiced her opposition to the move.
Andrea Williams, chief executive of the Christian Legal Centre, said: ""Buffer zones are an oppressive part of the current culture which force consent and silence dissent.""
BCP Council confirmed it had recently received notice of a legal challenge to the PSPO order surrounding the clinic and that it was seeking legal advice and considering its position.

sports	Winter Olympics: Finnish skier Remi Lindholm suffers frozen penis in men's 50km cross-country	"Perhaps the worst part of it all for Finland's Remi Lindholm is that it was not even the first time it had happened.
Such was the chance of athletes suffering frostbite, freezing conditions at the Winter Olympics in Beijing had already seen the blue riband men's 50km cross-country ski delayed by an hour - and shortened to a 30km event.
But even those alterations could not save Lindholm from an ""unbearable"" fate.
mmediate concern for the 24-year-old, in the aftermath of completing the final event of his debut Olympic Games, was thawing out his frozen penis.
A heat pack eventually helped the Finn salvage the situation at the end of what was a gruelling race.
However, having spent almost one hour and 16 minutes out on the course in howling winds and appendage-threatening temperatures of -17C, he was, understandably, left in a tremendous amount of pain.
""You can guess which body part was a little bit frozen when I finished,"" Lindholm told Finnish media.
""It was one of the worst competitions I've been in. It was just about battling through.
""When the body parts started to warm up after the finish, the pain was unbearable.""
Poor Lindholm previously suffered a similar incident at a competition in Finland last year, with the thin suits and under layers worn by racers offering minimal protection from extreme cold."	/sport/winter-olympics/60466907

health	East of England Ambulance Service: 'If we are queuing, we can't get to patients'	"Paramedics describe a health service in crisis with a lack of investment and increasing demand, of lengthy waits to transfer patients to hospitals and of a social care system facing collapse. So what does a typical ambulance shift look like?
rea covered by the East of England Ambulance Service's nearly 400 front-line ambulances is vast.
It is responsible for more than six million people over a 7,500 sq mile (19,424 sq km) area, which includes Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk.
BBC joined one of the service's ambulance crews for a 12-hour shift, to see the work they do and to hear their concerns about the current state of the health service at large.
first call-out received by the Gorleston-based crew in Norfolk is for a patient in cardiac arrest. 
However, after putting on the blue lights, the crew is stood down and later diverted down to Oulton Broad in Suffolk to check on 82-year-old Pat Clarke. 
Ambulance call outs are categorised into four levels of seriousness, from Category 1, involving life threatening conditions, to Category 4, which is a non-urgent problem that requires transportation to a hospital or clinic.
Category 2 call-out, which means it is a serious condition such as a stroke or chest pain.
rew arrives within 30 minutes of the call coming in.
Ms Clarke has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and breast cancer. Her carer, Chloe Tiborcz, was concerned about Ms Clarke so dialled 111.
""I came in this morning and Pat was very breathless and had a cough as well, so I called the ambulance,"" Ms Tiborcz says. ""They came pretty quickly - within half an hour.
""It is very reassuring - I had a lady who had to wait eight hours pretty recently.""
ramedic crew says Ms Clarke could have been dealt with by a visit from her GP. But with GPs sometimes having to see up to 60 patients a day, they no longer have the resources to do such visits.
As it is, Ms Clarke does not need a hospital visit and is left to recuperate at home.
East of England paramedic on ambulance delay 'crisis'
Ed Wisken has been a paramedic for 13 years.
An advanced paramedic specialising in urgent care, Mr Wisken says: ""It is really sad to see patients who have had to wait such a long time for an ambulance - but this is just the culmination of years of underfunding and of reduced resources peaking now where demand outstrips supply.""
""It is upsetting to see it,"" he says. ""It is not nice to see people who have been waiting hours and hours for an ambulance - but we have really hit crisis point now.""
He says the morale of fellow paramedics and other healthcare workers is currently very low.
""The key is you just have to do just one job at a time and just take the patients that you see and do the best for them,"" he says.
""If you worry about the bigger picture too much you will get frustrated and angry - but that's not going to be beneficial for yourself or your patients.""
From Oulton Broad, the crew is then called to Thorpe St Andrew, near Norwich, to see 97-year-old Eva Denny.
mergency services were called because those around her feared she may have had a stroke.
Family friend Yvonne Pechey says Ms Denny recently spent five weeks in hospital. During her stay, she went from being able to get around using her walking frame to losing the use of her legs.
ramedics check Ms Denny over and find she has an infection.  
Antibiotics are prescribed, but the crew has to wait more than 90 minutes for a GP to call them back to discuss medicine and a plan for Ms Denny's future care. 
GP wants to have her taken to hospital, but the family says given her previous deterioration in hospital they want her to stay put.
Instead, Ms Denny's infection will be managed at home.
Anna Savage is a former estate agent who ""kind of stumbled"" into the ambulance service.
An emergency medical technician, Ms Savage says she applied to the East of England Ambulance Service after speaking with friends already working there.
""I thought it would suit me, not being in an office job but being out and about and I haven't looked back,"" she says. ""I enjoy it and I want to keep going.""
""Every day is different,"" she says. ""I knew it could be a strain on you and your family life and I wasn't under any illusions.
""Delays at the moment are a big challenge for us to deal with.""
She says she senses the frustration felt by patients and their loved ones experiencing ambulance delays.
""And we can't really give them an answer either, we can only deal with the here and now and each situation.""
She wants the service to find a way of reducing such delays.
rd call takes the crew to a house near Wroxham, in Norfolk, where nine-year-old Max has complex epilepsy.
He experiences up to 30 fits each day.
His mother, Amy, administers midazolam as prescribed but, because it is strong medication, Max needs monitoring.
rew takes him straight to the children's assessment ward at the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital.  
Amy says dealing with Max's condition is ""really difficult"".
""They still don't really know why he has these seizures,"" she says. ""It impacts on his quality of life and on our family life.
""He's under a professor in the United States and is having tests at Great Ormond Street, but it is really hard when someone cannot tell you what is wrong with your child.
""They don't know why his medicine does not control his seizures, so he can't live a normal life at the moment. 
""The seizures are so severe that they always require medical intervention and he spends the majority of his life in a hospital.
""It is really tough.""
On this occasion, both a land ambulance and the East of England Air Ambulance were sent to Max's aid.
""Being surrounded by people who are able to help him in that situation makes me feel a bit safer, because I just panic like any mum or dad would.""
Stuart Knight is the leading operations manager at Gorleston ambulance station.
""We are experiencing handover delays at the hospital, which is obviously impacting wider in the community. It is a national pressure at the minute.
""Our crews are late off and it impacts on our vehicle availability for the next day.
""They can be anywhere from Cambridge to Ipswich, so they are driving a hell of a lot of miles and, if they are late off on top of that due to delays or if they get a late job, then that impacts on the following day because obviously they need an adequate rest period before they come in for their [next] shift.
""We've got welfare ideas to help staff and we are working with colleagues in the hospital to try and reduce delays.
""The last thing we want is for patients to be stuck in the back of an ambulance for 10 to 12 hours. It is not great for patients, it is not great for the crew. When that happens we can't get to patients in the community.""
A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Nobody should have to wait longer than necessary for emergency care, which is why we are taking urgent action to support services.
""This includes an extra £500m to speed up hospital discharge and free up beds - the details of which were announced on Wednesday - getting ambulances back on the road more quickly, delivering 50,000 more nurses, increasing the number of NHS 999 and 111 call handlers and creating the equivalent of at least 7,000 more beds.""

health	Urology: Aidan O'Brien's patients 'missed out on essential care'	"An inquiry into the clinical practice of a consultant urologist has heard how he refused to involve specialist cancer care nurses on his team.
A senior cancer specialist said patients under Mr Aidan O'Brien's care at Craigavon Area Hospital missed out due to the ""luck of the draw"".
All other patients received this care, the specialist said.
quiry is examining Mr O'Brien's work at the Southern Health trust between January 2019 and June 2020.
Earlier in November, the inquiry heard that almost 600 patients received ""suboptimal care"" as his patients.
Dr Dermot Hughes was involved in a review of nine serious incidents involving the urologist.
He told the inquiry he found it unusual that cancer care nurses were not involved in any of his cases.
Dr Hughes said that, in his experience, it was normal practice for care to be shared and that cancer care nurses were integral.
""That way, there is seamless care - so there is a clinical care nurse specialist either to support the patient or to be with the patient or to inform the patient of their illness,"" said Dr Hughes.
""In my experience, the professional giving the care should be the person referring the patient to the clinical care specialist. 
""But the issue here in the Southern Trust is that, clearly, Mr O'Brien did not work with clinical work specialists in his oncology clinics. 
""He did not involve them in the classic roles of cancer nurse specialists in terms of holistic assessment, informing patients of their disease and discussing their options.""
Dr Hughes said his reviews found that this situation had been raised by nurses with the trust but that it had failed to act.   
""The practice in the Southern Trust was that all other patients received this care in tandem with their consultant, but a separate cohort did not,"" he said.
""That issue was known but not dealt with.""
quiry, chaired by Christine Smith KC, also heard from urologist Mr Hugh Gilbert who worked in the review team with Dr Hughes. 
He described the benefits of having a care nurse assigned for cancer patients undergoing treatment, saying ""it continuously allows the patient access to information and support"".
""It just so happens that the best-placed person for that is a cancer nurse specialist as they have not only knowledge of the medical aspects of care but also in the nursing aspects of care which are fundamental to a patient's wellbeing,"" said Mr Gilbert.
""At the time of discussion (of a patient's diagnosis), a key worker is appointed and that is usually, almost inevitably, a cancer nurse specialist. 
""They are named and their name is put on all printed materials.""
Dr Hughes said families were concerned to learn from the review team that their relatives were being treated differently and missed out on vital support.
""The role of the cancer nurse specialist really is essential.
""It is informative; patients receive better experience and the families found it difficult to know that the majority of patients received this and their cohort did not.
""The care that is delivered by those nurses in the Southern Trust was exemplary. 
""But for these patients it was the luck of the draw because they were allocated a particular professional, they didn't get this service.""
Mr O'Brien worked at the Southern Health Trust from 1992 until his retirement in July 2020.
He was temporarily excluded from the workplace in 2017 before returning under supervision.
quiry's role is to examine the clinical and corporate governance of the Southern Health Trust."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63797969
technology	Crypto giant FTX collapses into bankruptcy	"Embattled cryptocurrency exchange FTX has filed for bankruptcy in the US, seeking court protection as it looks for a way to return money to users.
Former boss Sam Bankman-Fried has also stepped down as chief executive, the company said.
It is a massive turn of fortunes for the 30-year-old, who had headed the world's second largest crypto exchange.
In just over a week, his FTX empire has collapsed, shaking confidence in the already troubled crypto market.
""I'm really sorry, again, that we ended up here. Hopefully things can find a way to recover,"" Mr Bankman-Fried, nicknamed the 'King of Crypto', wrote on Twitter on Friday. 
""I was shocked to see things unravel the way they did.""
Prior to the meltdown, Mr Bankman-Fried had been one of the stars of the crypto scene, drawing comparisons to investment magnate Warren Buffett, with a net worth estimated at more than $15bn (£12.8bn) as recently as Monday.
But rumours earlier this week that FTX and other firms owned by Mr Bankman-Fried were on shaky financial ground prompted a mass of customers to try to withdraw funds from FTX, an exchange used to buy and sell digital tokens. 
Facing a cash crunch, Mr Bankman-Fried tried to organize a bailout but that failed, leaving FTX scrambling to raise billions of dollars and many customers unable to access their money.
By filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the company can continue operating, while restructuring its debts under court supervision. 
FTX said the goal was to ""begin an orderly process to review and monetize assets for the benefit of all global stakeholders"".
""The FTX Group has valuable assets that can only be effectively administered in an organised, joint process,"" said new chief executive John J Ray III, a lawyer who previously worked at a venture capital firm and has experience with high-profile bankruptcy cases.
In the filing, FTX estimated that it had between $10bn and $50bn in assets and liabilities and more than 100,000 creditors. 
roceeding involves FTX as well as Alameda Research, a trading firm founded by Mr Bankman-Fried, and roughly 130 affiliates, according to the statement FTX shared on Twitter. 
ude FTX's operations in the US, which Mr Bankman-Fried had said on Thursday were unaffected.
Mr Bankman-Fried said ""this doesn't necessarily have to mean the end for the companies or their ability to provide value and funds to their customers chiefly, and can be consistent with other routes.
""Ultimately I'm optimistic that Mr. Ray and others can help provide whatever is best"".
For now, Thomas Culham, from Kingston, said he has been unable to withdraw the £2,000 he had put into FTX - a ""big blow"" as his funds in FTX were ""decent chunk"" of his investment portfolio.
""It's probably gone,"" the 22-year-old said. ""Maybe in a few years' time I might get some sort of recovery - they do have assets [and] they should be able to liquidate them.""
Mr Bankman-Fried had enjoyed a high-profile in the crypto industry and beyond, frequently speaking on behalf of the sector before regulators.
He was a major donor to Democrats in the most recent US elections and had gone on an advertising blitz in the country, enlisting celebrities such as Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen to convince the public that crypto was a worthy investment.
But as he became a bigger figure, questions were raised about the ties between the different parts of his business empire and potential conflicts of interest between FTX and Alameda.
roubles at his firms have hurt the rest of the crypto market, with currencies such as Bitcoin dropping 20% this week, and raised pressure on other companies to prove they have the financial strength to stay afloat.
Several companies in the sector had already collapsed or approached collapse earlier this year, after a sharp downturn in the value of digital assets. BlockFi, another crypto firm with ties to FTX, stopped clients from making withdrawals on Thursday because of the situation.
""FTX going down is not good for anyone in the industry. Do not view it as a win for us. User confidence is severely shaken,"" wrote Changpeng Zhao, the chief executive of FTX's larger rival, Binance, which had said it might buy FTX this week only to walk away.
Regulators have long warned of risks to crypto investors and raised concern about the threat of wider financial turmoil, as traditional financial companies expand their investments in the market, despite little regulation.
FTX, which is now reportedly under investigation by several financial authorities, had enjoyed backing from major investment firms, including Blackrock, Softbank and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan in Canada. 
But Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush Securities, said he did not think FTX's troubles would spark wider problems in the stock market. 
""It's a black swan event. There's really no bleed over into the overall market, there's containment,"" he said. ""That's extremely important and another positive signal in terms of the walls between systematic risk and not."" 
Mr Bankman-Fried admitted that the downfall is ""on me"" but that will be scant consolation to the potentially 1.2 million FTX customers who could now lose their crypto savings.
Despite potentially losing his money, Mr Culham said this week's events wouldn't put him off investing in more cryptocurrencies in the future. 
""I think there's a lot of opportunity,"" he said, adding that he was not investing more than he could afford to lose, and also not investing in only one type of crypto.

business	Cost of living: Half of students in financial difficulty as prices soar	"Half of students in England are facing money problems as the cost of living soars, an official survey suggests.
More than three-quarters are also worried that soaring costs will affect their academic success, according to the research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 41 years, with the official inflation rate at 11.1%. 
Students said they had taken on more debt as their mental health suffered.
People in higher education generally do not qualify for government cost-of-living payments. 
However, universities and colleges are offering a range of support for students, including enhanced hardship grants, cheap meals, and free period products.
Last week, the University of Manchester said it would give its full-time students a one-off payment of £170 to help with the cost of living, as part of a £9m support scheme. It said it would also provide e-books, scrap library fines and put in other measures to help with rising costs.
ONS said its survey was the first official research of its kind, experimental, and based on the views of 4,000 students. 
One in four said they had taken on new debt in response to ballooning food and energy bills. Meanwhile, nearly half said their mental health had suffered.
Students at university in Warwick say they are feeling pressure from rising prices
ONS suggested that 91% of higher education students reported that their cost of living had increased compared with last year, with the same proportion somewhat, or very, worried about the rising cost of living.
Respondents also said it had an impact on their studies with:
Nearly one in five said they had considered moving back to their family home and commuting to their university.
Various surveys have suggested that students are facing financial and mental health concerns as soaring prices take a toll on their wellbeing.
Last month, BBC research indicated that one in 10 young people had used a food bank in the last six months.
, conducted by Ipsos on behalf of Radio 1 and BBC Newsbeat, asked a representative sample of 2,719 British young people - 16 to 24-year-olds - about their worries and concerns.
A separate survey in September, run by the website Save The Student, found that four in five of those asked had considered the prospect of dropping out of university. Half of those blamed money worries.
More than eight in 10 of those asked said they worried about making ends meet, with the average maintenance loan falling short of living costs.

entertainment	Nandi Bushell releases debut single written to 'cheer up Dad'	"A schoolgirl who has performed with some of the world's biggest rock stars has released a new single inspired by her dad's health struggles.
Nandi Bushell, 12, of Ipswich, Suffolk, has bookended this month by drumming at the Foo Fighters' Taylor Hawkins memorial gig and launching her track. 
multi-instrumentalist has also won the attention of Barack Obama and tech giant Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
Nandi said: ""I wrote a song to cheer [my dad] up.""
mpanying video to The Shadows, released on 30 September, charts Nandi's journey from toying around with instruments in her former South African home as a toddler to playing guitars and drums with her dad, with current studio footage of her playing a grand piano.
Quick Q&A with drumming star Nandi Bushell
""The single is about how my dad went through depression... because his auto-immune disease was worsening,"" said Nandi. 
""He told me and he was really upset so I made a song about it.""
Mr Bushell said he felt Nandi's song had ""genuinely helped him"" and hoped it would have the same impact on other people.
""I was having flare-ups all over my body and I was feeling really, really terrible,"" he said.
""Nandi was asking me questions and I was describing how I felt trapped in the bed and in my room, and she said how she wanted to do something to cheer me up. I said all my rainbows felt like they were turning to black. 
""She said, 'Let me put these words into the song,' and finished it by saying, 'I'll be there for you'. I thought this is incredible, [it was] such a beautiful moment.""
r hope the track will reach a wide audience, fuelled in part by Nandi's 2.5m social media followers, a forthcoming appearance on children's TV programme Blue Peter this Monday and her meeting this week with Apple chief Mr Cook.
Her profile has been boosted following a string of extraordinary events including performing with Lenny Kravitz, appearing on US talk show Ellen and writing a song in 2021 with ex-Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello and his son Roman, which former US President Barack Obama posted on his Facebook page.
However, it is her enduring link-up with Foo Fighters that has continued to make headlines after she challenged frontman Dave Grohl to a drum battle during one of the coronavirus lockdowns. It led him to write Nandi a song and he invited her to perform with them at The Forum in Los Angeles last year.
It was there that the band's drummer Taylor Hawkins, who died aged 50 earlier this year, gave the young prodigy his drumsticks.
Poignantly, Nandi used them during her performance for Learn to Fly at his Wembley Stadium tribute gig.
""There was this balcony where I could see the gig happening - it was emotional,"" said Nandi.
She said appearing at both gigs, along with playing at the Queen's Platinum Jubilee concert where she cried after meeting her hero Stephen Fry, had been the highlights of her life so far.
But for now her sights are set on her single release and her forthcoming EP, Into The Abyss, released later this year.
""If one person who is going through a difficult time listens to that song and decides to reach out for help, then that is a measure of success,"" said Mr Bushell.

sports	Michael O'Neill: What's on NI manager's 'to-do' list as he returns for second spell?	"It's almost three weeks since Michael O'Neill strode purposefully, and very happily, back through the door at Windsor Park.
man who made history during his first spell as Northern Ireland manager by leading them to the Euro 2016 finals has returned - by very popular demand - for a second spell in charge of his country. 
You could barely wipe the smile off the 53-year-old's face as he carried out his wide-ranging media duties. No question was shirked and no topic dismissed across over two hours of group briefings and one-to-one interviews as O'Neill looked ahead to what he hopes to achieve over the course of his second tenure.
And while the length of his contract - five and a half years - may have surprised some, it was clear that the 'building for the future' narrative regularly pedalled by predecessor Ian Baraclough has moved down the agenda. 
king advantage of a fortuitously favourable draw for Euro 2024 qualifying, a group that includes Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Kazakhstan and San Marino, is very much O'Neill's immediate aim. And he was comfortable in asserting that it can be done.  
Yes, there is the prospect of Northern Ireland being one of the host countries for Euro 2028. And, yes, O'Neill was beaming with pride at the prospect of being the manager at the helm for that, but that, and the development of young players for it, seems very much like phase two of his return.
Phase one of reign two, however, will be focused on successfully navigating the upcoming qualifying campaign, another one condensed between March and November, and getting to the finals in Germany. 
With that in mind, BBC Sport takes a look at some of the things that might be on the former Shamrock Rovers manager's 'to-do' list as he aims to achieve that goal.
mile O'Neill was wearing at his unveiling will most definitely have gone when it was confirmed by Rangers on Christmas Eve that Northern Ireland's inspirational captain Steven Davis will miss the rest of this season with a serious knee injury. 
Without speculating on whether Davis, who will turn 38 on 1 January, will ever return to playing, it looks certain that O'Neill will be without him for the opening four Euro 2024 qualifiers - San Marino away, Finland at home, Denmark away and Kazakhstan at home - at least.
As it did for all Northern Ireland supporters, the news will have come as a devastating blow to O'Neill. He revealed on day one of the job that day two would see a trip to Glasgow to meet with the Rangers veteran to discuss his international future - and it clearly went well, with Davis having since indicated his intention to continue playing for his country.
However, the new manager will now have to choose a new captain and the likelihood is that Jonny Evans will wear the armband.
O'Neill will also have to decide on who is best placed to anchor what was nearly always a three-man midfield during his first spell. There are a few experienced options - Stuart Dallas, Paddy McNair, Corry Evans and Jordan Thompson among them - while O'Neill might think Ali McCann or exciting young Man City prospect Shea Charles are ready to take on a more pivotal role in the engine room.   
O'Neill had a core group of senior players during his first spell that he seemed to form close relationships with, allowing him to not only squeeze every ounce of performance from them but be comfortable enough to give them the responsibility to ensure the rest of the squad were fully on board with everything he wanted to do.
It's a symbiotic relationship that you never felt Baraclough was able to form with the likes of Davis, Jonny Evans and Stuart Dallas - certainly not to the same extent at least - as the focus shifted towards flooding the squad with younger, emerging talent.
O'Neill has clearly not lessened his view on how much of an asset the senior players can be, revealing that conversations he had with them were a key factor in his decision to return. 
He will no doubt not take long to get reacquainted with the players he has managed before, but he will also have to form new and productive relationships with the youngsters who established themselves in the squad under Baraclough, such as Dan Ballard, McCann and Charles.
rsonnel will, of course, feed into the style of play that O'Neill decides to go with but, while he did at times opt for a back three before, the 3-5-2 that became the go-to formation for his predecessor was not a system he often deployed.
One of the key hallmarks of O'Neill's first reign in charge was how he completely transformed the mindset of Northern Ireland players and supporters. 
Irish FA hashtags may not have been for everyone, but they captured the mood as belief was very much re-instilled in a team that began picking up results with a consistency that had not been enjoyed since Billy Bingham's glorious spell in the 1980s. 
Baraclough could quite fairly point to a number of mitigating factors, but that belief has most definitely drained from around Windsor Park over the last few years, and O'Neill noted the need for it to be ""reignited"".
And, of course, he has previous in resurrecting a national team at a low ebb in terms of results and morale. That was the case when he first took over from Nigel Worthington in December 2011 and, though his first campaign was unremarkable, a team meeting before qualification for Euro 2016 began set out a very clear and practical pathway to the finals in France.
Having a similar positive impact on player and supporter morale, on a more fast-tracked pace than before, will be important to O'Neill securing what would be only a second-ever European Championship qualification for Northern Ireland.
Crucial to fuelling that belief during O'Neill's first spell was how Northern Ireland began winning home games at Windsor Park on a regular basis. 
Across the qualification campaigns for Euro 2016, World Cup 2018 and Euro 2020, O'Neill's side won nine and drew three of the 15 matches played at their south Belfast base, roared on at every one by a capacity crowd that created an atmosphere revered around Europe. 
And it was not just wins over lowly-ranked countries such as San Marino and Azerbaijan, though these were on the list. It was against solid sides with decent pedigrees - such as Czech Republic and Norway - who will likely have travelled to Belfast expecting a draw at least. 
It's not a trend that Baraclough was able to continue, a task that was significantly impeded by the loss of the Green and White Army in the stadium for the early games of his reign. The competitive record was played 11, won two and lost four, with the draw against Cyprus in June leading to boos and chants calling for the manager to go.
O'Neill spoke at his unveiling about how excited he is to step out as Northern Ireland manager once again at the National Stadium - and he knows that how his team fare as hosts will be key to his chances of success.
One of the most surprising aspects of O'Neill's media briefing was his willingness to discuss the possibility of two of his former players - ex-captain and now IFA technical director Aaron Hughes and current NI U19/17 coach Gareth McAuley - being part of his backroom team. 
Niall McGinn has already said what a boost this would be and the fact O'Neill did not shut down the questions about the former defensive stalwarts, both on camera and off it, would suggest that at least one of them is likely to be one of his coaches. 
Whether the pair are involved or not, one thing the new manager will no doubt be keen to do is restore consistency to the first-team coaching staff. The chopping and changing nature of the coaches brought in and out under Baraclough - admittedly for a range of factors - could not have been helpful to preparation and the training session dynamic.
Attention to detail and careful, methodical planning were hallmarks of O'Neill's successful first reign, with the likes of Austin MacPhee and Stephen Robinson playing important roles for a manager who realised the importance of scenario planning for all eventualities in gaining an edge in games.

xhibition has been running since April.
Following the burning, the remaining sculptures will be dismantled.
Relevé, a monumental timber structure by artist Rebekah Waites, was designed and built for the purpose of being burned, following the tradition of the the Burning Man festival in Nevada, on which the event is based.
ulpture was inspired by the Nine Ladies Stone Circle, a Bronze Age archaeological site located near Chatsworth.
Visitors to the exhibition have been writing notes on Relevé in the knowledge that the sculpture will be burned.

business	Port of Felixstowe: More strike action possible, says union	"union on strike at the UK's busiest container port warned there could be further industrial action.
Workers at the Port of Felixstowe in Suffolk walked out on 27 September for eight days after the union Unite rejected an imposed pay deal.
About 1,900 union members also took action in August, with Unite asking for a pay rise to match the rate of inflation - currently at about 10%.
rt said its pay increase of 7% plus £500 was ""very fair"".
Hutchison Ports, part of a multi-national conglomerate based in China, previously said the ""bargaining process has been exhausted"" between in port and the union, but Miles Hubbard, regional officer for Unite said he did not accept that.
""This is the second tranche of strike action; people are as determined as they have been to stick it out and, if necessary, take further action,"" he said.
Mr Hubbard told BBC Politics East that workers wanted ""a fair share and a pay rise which comes close to matching inflation"".
""The company have further provoked the workforce by imposing the pay offer,"" he said.
Mr Hubbard said 82% of union members had rejected the 7% offer ""so we're here for the long haul"".
A spokesman for Hutchison said in a statement: ""The port is in the process of implementing a very fair pay increase of 7% plus £500.
""The pay award is effective from 1 January [2022] when CPI inflation was 5.4%.
""One branch of Unite at the port has already put the same pay offer to their members, who voted to accept it.
""The next pay rise is due 1 January 2023, and we will discuss that with Unite in the normal way.""
One of the workers on strike at the Port of Felixstowe was Andrew Godwin.
""At the moment nationwide there is a cost-of-living crisis affecting everyone, none more so than here,"" he said.
""We've all got bills to pay, mortgages to pay, families to feed and it's not enough to cover that cost.
""It's time was did something about it.""

group legal action, led by consumer rights champion Alex Neill, could see almost nine million gamers compensated.
It claims Sony PlayStation breached competition law, imposing unfair terms and conditions on games' developers and publishers, and driving up prices.
""The game is up,"" said Ms Neill. Sony PlayStation has yet to comment.
m, filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal, alleges the gaming company abused its position as the market leader to impose terms and conditions on games' developers and publishers, including a 30% commission on every digital game or in-game purchase made through the online PlayStation Store.
gal case claims Sony PlayStation's actions have driven up prices for consumers, resulting in customers being ""unwittingly overcharged"" for digital gaming purchases by up to a total of £5bn over the past six years.
mated damages per individual in the claim is said to be between £67 and £562. 
It applies to any customer who has purchased digital games or add-on content on their console or through the PlayStation Store since August 2016.
""We believe we've got a really strong case, or else we wouldn't be doing this,"" Ms Neill told BBC News. ""It is a big undertaking to take on a company like Sony.""
""With this legal action, I am standing up for the millions of UK people who have been unwittingly overcharged,"" she said.
""We believe Sony has abused its position and ripped off its customers.
""The actions of Sony are costing millions of people who can't afford it, particularly when we're in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis and the consumer purse is being squeezed like never before.""
It is not the first time that concerns have been raised over commission on digital platforms and accessing content. Similar actions have been brought in other countries against Apple and Google.
""Once you are in those Apple or Android operating systems, you're left with no choice but to pay the high costs for content because there is no alternative. We say it's pretty much the same for Sony PlayStation customers,"" Ms Neill told BBC News. 
PlayStation users will automatically have a claim if they:
But Ms Neill warned that cases of this nature can take several years to resolve and that people who might be eligible for compensation could be left waiting if Sony PlayStation refuses to settle the claim.
""We would expect, given the number of consumers affected and the amount we believe they have overcharged by, that Sony would want to bring this forward and settle.

entertainment	Canopy damage threatens Sterts Theatre's future	"A landmark Cornish theatre could be forced to close unless it can raise £500,000 to replace its roof.
Sterts Arts Centre at Upton Cross near Liskeard was damaged by the summer's extreme heat.
Work to replace it and the supporting structure needs to happen before the start of the 2023 summer season, meaning the money needs to be found imminently.
Choreographer Jason Pook said it would be ""devastating"" to close the theatre.
Arts Centre's director Kate Rogers said the theatre provided ""opportunities for people of all ages, of all backgrounds within the community to experience the arts"".
Asked what would happen if the money could not be raised, Ms Rogers said: ""Realistically that means next season can't happen, we have some really big titles booked for next season which is fantastic and if we can't perform them, if we can't open, there is a very significant risk Sterts will have to close.""
Alan Collings, from the theatre, said one of the bars of the canopy's support structure was ""kinked"".
He said: ""In the heat and the storms it acts like a honeycomb so when one part of the honeycomb goes it becomes weak, so the whole canopy has twisted around to the right.""
re opened in 1990 and had a series of temporary covers to protect audiences from the elements before getting its first permanent canopy in 1994.
urrent canopy was installed eight years ago in 2014 and while it is still safe, the fear is further bad weather could make the situation worse.
Mr Pook, who choreographed the upcoming production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat, said: ""It would be devastating I think, not only for us as creators but for the community, especially for around here because there's not too much going on around this area particularly - we're very isolated in Cornwall.""

technology	Cost of living: Port Talbot mum's debt drove her to the brink	"When her 16-year-old daughter called ""petrified"" that bailiffs in full body armour were banging on the door, Julie Andrews realised she needed help.
rer was £28,000 in debt for not paying gas, electric and council tax bills and had payday loans so she could buy her three children school uniform.
""There were times I thought I wasn't going to manage and there were times I tried to take my life,"" said Julie, 57.
Julie wants to warn of high interest loans amid the cost of living crisis.
Experts estimate that one in seven people in the UK - more than seven million people - are financially excluded.
where people's credit profiles are so poor that things like loans or mobile phone contracts, for example, have higher interest rates and are more expensive. 
Wales has highest proportion of financial exclusion in Great Britain, including Julie, who was so ""ashamed"" she was one of those in financial difficulty she didn't tell anyone - even her family or closest friends.
""I had to wait for the kids to leave the house before I broke down,"" said the residential care home worker from south Wales.
""It was tough. It's something people don't want to talk about because you're ashamed.
""It was the fear, I brought my children up that you don't answer the door until I'm there - and every time I went out, I was looking over my shoulder to see if anybody was coming up the street, like debt collectors or bailiffs.""
Her money troubles began when Julie, who lives in a two-bedroom home in Port Talbot, got divorced and her father, who used to help her, died.
""It's so easy as I carried on being a single mum and started ignoring all of the bills - and before you know it, I was £28,000 in debt,"" she said.
""The kids went without but had what they had to and I went to foodbanks.""
But Julie said her children ""had to have something to open on Christmas Day or their birthdays"" and added there was ""no other way"" than to get a high interest loan.
""I don't care if I borrowed £500 and have to pay £1,500 back,"" she said. 
""They may have gone without holidays or luxury food but Christmas... no. I couldn't see my babies go without. You've got to get for your children at Christmas."" 
Julie said she found it difficult to seek help or talk to someone about her problems, almost until it was too late when she considered taking her own life. But she said she could not go through with it.
""I realised this was the lowest point you can go,"" she recalled. 
""Having lost my mother when I was young, I was now [considering] taking my children's mother from them - and more to the point, they will find me - I can't have that.""
Julie remembers the day when she finally sought financial help to stop the suffering of not just her, but her family.
""I was at work and my daughter, who was 16 at the time, she rang and said there were bailiffs at the house threatening her,"" Julie recalled.
""So I told her not to answer the door and put the phone through the letterbox and I told them politely I'm at work and stop threatening my daughter. I told them the debt is mine, not her debt. 
""I was petrified, she was petrified and I thought this is not fair on the children. My family was gobsmacked when I told them I was in so much debt.""
Although not a religious person, Julie got free help from Christians Against Poverty after seeing the not-for-profit organisation recommended on TV by money saving expert Martin Lewis.
Julie's creditors, froze her debts and helped her declare herself bankrupt. Christians Against Poverty estimate that 13% of the UK adults have fallen behind on their bills.
Now most loans have become more expensive since the Bank of England put up interest rates to 2.25% last month - the highest level for 14 years - and rates are forecast to rise to about 6% by the spring.
About 370,000 people in Wales - that's one in six, the highest rate in Scotland, England or Wales - are classed as financially excluded, according to financial analysts. 
means they do not have access to high street financial services and pay more for bills like utilities.
Analysts also say data shows county court judgements (CCJs) have doubled in Wales in the past two years, with what they say is a ""worrying"" rise in CCJs for ""small debts"" under £500.
""More people are applying for short-term loans at a higher price,"" said Steve Elliot of Cardiff-based Lexis Nexis Risk Solutions.
He added: ""Life at the moment is difficult for an increasingly number of people and having clear financial records that are able to give people access to financial and utility services in a more affordable way is a significant step to help them reduce cost.""
Christians Against Poverty (CAP) have said calls to their helpline are rising every month and in the past two months, they have tripled the amount of emergency fuel top-ups than they did last year.
Now the organisation is calling on the UK government to raise benefits in line with inflation and ""review their plans"" to cut the Energy Price Guarantee from a minimum of two years to six months.
""We are increasingly seeing people coming to us that are struggling with fuel bills,"" said Karen Homans of CAP.
""This is particularly bad for those that are reliant on using expensive oil to heat their often poorly insulated and drafty homes.
""While we work with each person to look at their debts and help them maximise their income, more and more people are finding that they simply don't have enough income to match the skyrocketing energy and cost of living increases.""
ries of financial struggles resonates with Julie and all she hopes is people in difficulty call for help before they get as deep into debt as she did.
""There are millions like me,"" she said. ""Debt can ruin your life - calling for help was the best call I made. 
""I'm petrified of slipping back into my old habits but I will never be there again. I don't know how I will stay out of debt but I'm hoping to.
""I'm still struggling. I work 30 hours a week, I'm only just keeping my head above the surface. I had 23p Universal Credit last month, I can't afford to shop every week and use the food bank occasionally. I can't do everything I want but have money to live on.""
Julie is now enjoying life as a grandmother to seven children, all under the age of six, which she could not have envisaged before she sought help with her debt.

business	Energy bills set to rise again in October, regulator warns	"Householders should expect a further rise in energy bills in England, Wales and Scotland in October, the boss of energy regulator Ofgem has said.
Jonathan Brearley said prices in the wholesale energy market remained ""highly volatile"".
Not being able to afford energy bills was a matter of life and death for some people, he said.
Analysts Cornwall Insight predicted that a typical domestic energy bill will go up by £600 a year in October.
would take the typical household's gas and and electricity bill to £2,595.
In a speech in Glasgow, Mr Brearley said that gas markets were in a febrile state following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
""The market remains highly volatile and as a result we do expect further price increases later this year,"" he said.
He said that the effect of higher prices was ""putting huge strain on the customers we serve"".
""I talk to customers on a regular basis, and I know how tough rising energy prices are for many households and businesses,"" he said.
""For some, not being able to afford rising energy bills is literally a matter of life and death.""
He pointed to a case in which a woman who was being treated for a brain tumour had worries about keeping up with energy bills.
""What was shocking was to learn that she feels more comfortable in hospital where she can eat and be warm than at home,"" he said.
A widely-predicted increase in October comes on top of a £700 typical rise in annual domestic gas and electricity bills, which took effect in April when the price cap was last raised. Consumers in Northern Ireland - not covered by the price cap - have already seen significant increases in bills.
Businesses have also faced higher energy costs, which may lead to them charging higher prices.
Mr Brearley reiterated a commitment to updating the price cap, putting suppliers under greater scrutiny and helping move the UK away from a reliance on gas.
Earlier on Monday, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research suggested an estimated 1.5 million households across the UK will struggle to pay food and energy bills over the next year.
A Treasury spokesperson said the country has had a ""strong economic recovery"" from the pandemic but acknowledged that these were ""anxious times"", and said the government was taking action to support households.
udes £200 being taken off energy bills from October, but households will pay that back in instalments from 2023.

politics	Next election will be independence vote - Nicola Sturgeon	"Nicola Sturgeon says the next election will be a ""de facto"" vote on Scottish independence
Nicola Sturgeon has said the SNP will use the next general election as an attempt to show a majority of people in Scotland support independence.
first minister was responding to the Supreme Court's unanimous ruling she does not have the power to hold a referendum next year. 
Ms Sturgeon said she respected the ruling, which she admitted was a ""tough pill to swallow"". 
But she said the independence movement had to now find a new way forward. 
UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak welcomed the ""clear and definitive ruling from the Supreme Court"".
He told MPs: ""The people of Scotland want us to be working on fixing the major challenges that we collectively face, whether that's the economy, supporting the NHS or indeed supporting Ukraine.
""Now is the time for politicians to work together and that's what this government will do."" 
Ms Sturgeon had wanted to hold a referendum on 19 October next year but the UK government has refused to grant the formal consent that was in place ahead of the last referendum in 2014, when voters backed staying in the UK by 55% to 45%. 
Supreme Court ruled that the Scottish Parliament does not have the power to legislate on the constitution, including the union between Scotland and England, without that consent being in place. 
Speaking to the media at a hotel in Edinburgh after the ruling was announced, Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that there would be a ""real sense of frustration today in both the SNP and in the wider movement"".
But she said that she believed this would be ""short-lived"", predicted that rallies planned for several towns and cities across Scotland on Wednesday evening would show the ""strength"" of the independence campaign. 
Ms Sturgeon said her preferred route to independence was still through a referendum, but admitted that there was currently little prospect of Mr Sunak changing his opposition to a vote being held. 
She said this showed that the UK was not a voluntary union, and accused the UK government of ""outright democracy-denial"", a position she predicted was ""unsustainable"". 
first minister added: ""We must and we will find another democratic, lawful means for Scottish people to express their will"", with the next general election being the most obvious vehicle for that.
She said the SNP would now begin the process of deciding precisely how a ""de facto"" referendum would work, with a special party conference to be held in the new year. 
rty will also launch a ""major campaign in defence of Scottish democracy"", she said.  
Conservatives and Labour have already rejected the idea of the election acting as a referendum, arguing that general elections are fought on a range of issues and not just the constitution. 
SNP won 45% of the votes in Scotland at the last general election in 2019 while winning 48 of the 59 seats. 
Recent opinion polls have suggested that the country is essentially split down the middle on the independence question, but with a very narrow majority in favour of staying in the UK.
Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed that unless the UK government suddenly and unexpectedly agrees to an independence referendum, she will take the campaign into the next UK general election.
Plan C - to seek to win majority support for independence from Scottish voters in that election and, if achieved, to claim that as a mandate for Scotland to leave the union.
It will be for a special SNP conference in the new year to decide the details of this approach - including what the question would be and what Nicola Sturgeon should do if her party and its allies win more than 50% of the vote.
It is a big gamble. The SNP has never won that big before. 16 and 17-year-olds don't get the vote in a UK election. Any number of other issues will be in play and there is likely to be a close focus on the battle between Labour and the Conservatives for Number 10.
re is, of course, no guarantee that the next prime minister would accept the election outcome as if it had been a single issue referendum.
Nicola Sturgeon would not be drawn on her future or the impact on the independence campaign if the SNP falls short in that election, except to say that ""if we can't win, we don't deserve to be independent""."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63730653
technology	FTX woes: 'I'm waiting to get £2,000 back from crypto giant'	"FTX users have described feeling ""hopeful"" after withdrawals on the cryptocurrency exchange have appeared to restart.
mas Culham, 22, told the BBC that he had lodged a withdrawal request for £2,000.
Bitcoin touched a two-year low after the Binance pulled out of a deal to rescue its smaller rival, FTX.
xchange, used to buy and sell digital tokens, is still advising customers not to make deposits.
According to Coindesk and reports from users on social media, the troubled platform has allowed some customers to withdraw funds for the first time in days.
mas, a 22-year-old from Kingston, has been an FTX customer for more than a year, and describes it as a ""hub for crypto"".
He says he was able to lodge a withdrawal request for £2,000 he held on the exchange, which he describes as a ""really significant amount of money"".
But he says he has concerns around the volume of requests made by FTX customers, and is not sure whether or not they will all be serviced as the company battles on.
On Thursday, Bitcoin fell below $16,000 (£14,049) for the first time since 2020. Investor confidence was hit by the news that Binance had scrapped its deal to buy FTX, citing concerns over due diligence.
re are also fears of further crypto market volatility if FTX goes bust.
Concerns about the company's financial health reportedly triggered $6bn (£5.2bn) of withdrawals in just three days.
""I thought FTX was safe"", another customer told the BBC earlier on Thursday.
""I've got about $3,000 (£2,630) worth of coins in my own crypto wallet but more worrying is that I invested $33,000 (£28,900) for my mum and stepdad through the app. I don't yet have the heart to tell them what's happened.""
Binance said reports of ""mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations"" had swayed its decision not to buy FTX. 
Reuters news agency reported that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was investigating FTX's handling of customer funds and its crypto-lending activities.
markets regulator is also examining whether the platform has broken laws with regards to how it has handled customer assets.
Binance said in a statement posted on Twitter that the issues facing FTX were ""beyond our control or ability to help"".
""Every time a major player in an industry fails, retail consumers will suffer. We have seen over the last several years that the crypto ecosystem is becoming more resilient and we believe in time that outliers that misuse user funds will be weeded out by the free market.""
FTX's founder Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance's chief executive Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao are two of the most powerful people in the cryptocurrency market and high-profile rivals.
ressure on FTX came in part from Mr Zhao, who had tweeted on Sunday that Binance would sell its holdings of FTX's digital token, known as FTT. The token has lost around 90% of its value this week.
Binance stepped in on Tuesday, saying it had signed a letter of intent to buy FTX's non-US unit. But it added it had ""the discretion to pull out from the deal at any time"".
Mr Zhao tweeted on Wednesday: ""Sad day. Tried, but [crying emoji]"".
As well as Bitcoin dropping on the news, shares in the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase fell by more than 9.5%.
Meanwhile, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital said it will completely write off its more than $210m investment in FTX, as the cryptocurrency exchange is at risk of bankruptcy.
""Based on our current understanding, we are marking our investment down to $0,"" the company said in a statement posted on Twitter.
April Joyner, a correspondent at Business Insider in New York, told the BBC's Today programme the problems at FTX could be quite serious.
""If FTX were to go under a lot of people could potentially lose their money depending on what's going on there,"" she said.
A notice on its website still reads: ""FTX is currently unable to process withdrawals. We strongly advise against depositing.""
FTX was approached by BBC News for comment.
""It's also led to a lot of turmoil on crypto markets - we've seen prices of Bitcoin, Etherium etc fall and so there's a lot of distress and worries about the crypto markets right now,"" Ms Joyner added.
Ms Joyner said the ""different players"" in cryptocurrency firms were ""very enmeshed"" with each other which meant ""if one entity has some sort of weakness it can bring down a lot of other players"".
re is a growing list of cryptocurrency businesses that have failed because of a lack of cash reserves.
Adding to the pressure, the SEC and other regulators have been ratcheting up scrutiny of the industry as concerns grow about how crypto platforms are trading.
Earlier this year, a subsidiary of crypto firm BlockFi agreed to pay a record penalty to settle charges related to its retail lending product."	/news/business-63577783
politics	COP27: We cannot go wobbly on climate change, says Boris Johnson	"Watch: Boris Johnson says he is at COP 27 in 'purely supportive role'
Boris Johnson has said nations cannot ""go weak and wobbly"" on climate change targets, as he attended COP27 in Egypt.
Speaking in Sharm el-Sheikh, the ex-prime minister said the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions had suffered as a result of the Ukraine war. 
His comments were echoed by UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday.
Mr Johnson also said he was glad Mr Sunak was attending COP27 - adding he was on ""absolutely the right lines"".
In return, Mr Sunak said the presence of both the current and former prime ministers showed the UK's commitment to tackling climate change.
""It is great that the former prime minister is here,"" Mr Sunak said. ""It just demonstrates our leadership on this issue globally.""
World leaders have gathered at the Red Sea resort for two weeks of talks on climate action.
On Monday evening, Mr Sunak addressed the summit, insisting that investing in green infrastructure is morally the right thing to do. 
He also told those gathered that the war in Ukraine is a reason to act faster to tackle climate change.
""Climate and energy security go hand-in-hand,"" he said in his first international appearance since taking office.
""Putin's abhorrent war in Ukraine and rising energy prices across the world are not a reason to go slow on climate change. They are a reason to act faster,"" Mr Sunak said.
Earlier in the day, speaking at a New York Times event, Mr Johnson warned it was not the moment ""to give in to Putin's energy blackmail"".
""The reason I'm here is because I am worried that the discussion about Ukraine, about what's happening there, is having all sorts of bad effects,"" he said. 
""It's making people anxious about net zero, it's making people anxious about whether we can really do it.""
He continued: ""I think that the risk is that some people will go weak and wobbly on net zero, we can't have that.""
In simple terms, reaching net zero means getting to a point where you are not adding to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
It can be achieved by reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out any that remain by removing an equivalent amount - either through natural means, like trees, which absorb carbon dioxide, or using technology. Many countries, like the UK, have set targets of reaching net zero by 2050.
Mr Johnson warned ""corrosive cynicism"" had developed over net zero following the spike in oil and gas prices. 
""People have drawn the conclusion that the whole project of net zero needs to be delayed, mothballed and put on ice - for instance we need to reopen coal-fired power stations and frack the hell out of the British countryside,"" he said, in an apparent dig at his successor Liz Truss. 
""So I believe here at Sharm is a moment where we really have to tackle this nonsense head on.""
Some Conservative MPs have called for a rethink of how the UK gets to net zero, with candidates in the summer's Tory leadership contest voicing concerns about the economic cost.
Ms Truss's government ended the ban on shale gas fracking before her resignation as prime minister. Her successor Mr Sunak has since reinstated the ban, a 2019 Conservative manifesto pledge.
Mr Johnson explained he was at COP27 in a ""purely supportive role"". 
Mr Sunak initially said he would not attend COP27. He changed his decision following criticism from climate campaigners, opposition parties and COP26 President Alok Sharma.
When asked if Mr Sunak was wrong to push for more oil and gas from the North Sea, Mr Johnson said it was right in the short term to recognise that there would be a transition period.
Mr Johnson added: ""[Rishi Sunak] made an outstanding speech the other day. He's on absolutely the right lines.""
was a very Johnsonian example of self-promotion.
""I am the spirit of Glasgow's COP26,"" he told the New York Times audience.
man who once criticised wind power as not capable of ""pulling the skin off a rice pudding"", is now ridiculing a Daily Telegraph journalist who questioned wind power's capabilities.
He boasted about the great achievements he claimed for the COP conference he oversaw as British prime minister.
re certainly were some ambitious pledges on finance, forests, cars, coal, methane and more made there.
But this conference is about delivering on those promises and that is a much tougher agenda. Tougher, because it means getting countries to actually cough up cash.
Johnson urged his audience to call forth the ""can-do Promethean spirit that will get us out of this mess"".
Put the electric throttle to the floor was his message.
But was this really directed at the audience in the hall or at the UK's current prime minister, Rishi Sunak, attending the leaders' reception here in Egypt, a few miles away?"	/news/uk-63539765
health	Urology inquiry: Department of Health to review early alert system	"Department of Health (DoH) is to review its ""early alert"" system because it's not working consistently, a public inquiry has been told.
review was revealed during evidence to the inquiry examining consultant urologist Dr Aidan O'Brien's work.
It is also examining the Southern Health and Social Care Trust's handling of urology services before May 2020.
quiry heard the DoH did not know about the urology problems until the end of July 2020.
rtment's permanent secretary Peter May said the ""early alert"" system - which allows information of concern to reach the department - needed to be clearly understood.
""There's always going to be a risk that something doesn't come forward because people don't feel it does meet the terms or perhaps is not recognised for the significance that it has when it appears,"" he said.
""So, I think anyone sitting here would be foolish to say that they have absolute confidence in a system of that nature. 
""It's all down to human judgement and prone to human error in relation to how systems of that nature work.""
He also admitted that there were shortcomings in the current system, saying: ""I think we're not clear at the moment that the policy is being implemented consistently.""
Explaining that the early alert system was to be reviewed, in the absence of a minister, he said: ""What we're trying to do is to make an existing policy work properly, as it were, rather than create a new policy.""
He said the aim of the review was to make sure the guidance is well understood.
Earlier, Mr May apologised to families and patients linked to the public inquiry. 
At the beginning of Tuesday's hearing, Mr May acknowledged the ""concerns, distress and anxiety"" caused by a previous review into urology services and by the current public inquiry.
He said the inquiry was one of a number of inquiries that had raised ""serious concerns"" about patient safety issues and the health services must learn, from all of them, ways to improve ""how these vital services are delivered"".
quiry previously held hearings with patients and families, in private, to learn first-hand about their experiences with the Southern Health and Social Care Trust (SHSCT).
Hundreds of families have been affected and over a thousand patients' records were recalled as a result of a review into Mr O'Brien's work.
first week of the inquiry heard opening statements from the legal representatives of each core participant which includes the DoH, SHSCT and Mr Aidan O'Brien.
From Tuesday, the inquiry will hear from other non-patient and family witnesses, beginning with Mr May, who became DoH permanent secretary earlier this year.
Previously, the inquiry heard that Mr O'Brien claimed the trust provided an ""unsafe"" service and was trying to shift blame on to its medics.
It has also been claimed that some private patients, under the care of Mr O'Brien, were given ""advantageous"" treatment over NHS patients with the same clinical priority.
quiry has already heard that Mr O'Brien rejected the suggestion that he had been ""improperly advantaging"" private patients.
Counsel for the inquiry, Martin Wolfe KC, also said during the opening week of the inquiry that it may have to consider which senior managers within the trust knew what and when.
A previous investigation found that there were ""earlier opportunities"" where those within the health trust could have added concern about Mr O'Brien's work prior to 2016.
Last week, the inquiry also heard that Mr O'Brien had left a 6.5cm swab in a patient after surgery and failed to identify it in a scan three months later.
g week of the inquiry was also told that almost 600 patients received ""sub-optimal care"" from Mr O'Brien's clinical practice."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63636884
sports	Commonwealth Games 2022: Badminton player Kirsty Gilmour's letter to her 16-year-old self	"Hey Kirsty! You're 16 and in your final year of high school. It feels like the end of something but, let me tell you, this is very much just the start. The start of so much. 
wo-time Scottish badminton medallist Kirsty Gilmour will be taking part in her fourth Games in Birmingham. BBC Sport asked her to write a letter to her 16-year-old self as she was preparing for her very first....
In this next year alone, you are going to compete in a Commonwealth Games, graduate high school, pass your driving test and start university. And it will all go past in a magnificent blur until you are 28, sitting in your flat, trying to think back and reflect on it all.
You are in that perfect spot where you feel like an adult and a child all at once. 
Your journey to Delhi won't start at the airport but at the information and kit day. You will be sitting in a lecture theatre with 300 other athletes and be bombarded with more information than your little brain can handle. Then the good bit: the kit. Fresh and smart. It will all feel a little surreal right now and, to be honest, it will continue to.
After the awkward picture by the front door with your new kit on and your bags packed, it will be time for your mum to drop you at the airport. Savour this because soon someone dropping you off will require them to take out a bank loan. 
Now the real journey begins. In a few years, you will be raging at having a middle seat for a 15-hour journey but you won't bat an eyelid. You're just buzzing to be there. Plus, the athlete to your right is some kind of big deal, apparently. Eilidh Child? I wonder if she ever made it?
u'll arrive in beautiful, vibrant, colourful India. The furthest you've ever travelled to play badminton. And it will be great. I promise. You'll be nervous, but not too nervous. You'll play some good games, some not so good games. You'll start to see what professional behaviours look like, and some not so professional ones. 
But you have one job: to play as much badminton as possible. You'll play singles, doubles and mixed and you'll learn a lot. No-one is counting on you to win a medal. Zero expectation and minimum pressure. Enjoy it now because that won't last long...
One overriding memory you'll take away from these Games is the kindest of one of your team-mates, Emma. You'll have a couple of rough days mentally and she'll be unnecessarily generous and kind. It will take more than a decade for you to say thank you when you cross paths at the Tokyo Olympics, but that won't even be on your radar yet.
Now that Delhi has rattled past in a glorious tornado of colour, you'll have found your feet a little. Or so you think. Let me tell you about Glasgow 2014...
So you are 20. You've started traveling the world playing tournaments. You're in university. You've moved out of home. You kind of know what you're doing. You are No.17 in the world and seeded No.2 for the Commonwealth Games. Cool. 
Glasgow is alight. The whole place is buzzing. You will never experience the city like this again. It's incredible. Blazing sunshine, food, music, arts, culture festivals... it's a vibe.
But gradually over the next few weeks your world will become very small. Every part of your life will be entangled in a Games web. Your friends are in the team, your relationship is in the team, your other friends and family are coming to watch, and you're only 15 minutes away from home. But you don't really realise this. You're still quite naive.
will be both the absolute best thing as it will protect you from so much, and also the absolute worst thing as it will affect your performance. But you'll learn some monumental lessons. They'll hurt, but you'll be glad they happened.
In these Games, you will have one of your proudest moments and biggest regrets all within 24 outrageous hours.
Let's start with the good bit. You're going to get a medal. I know! Congrats! And the even better news is you'll do it in an incredible manner. 
You'll win the first set of the semi-final against Tee Jing Yi from Malaysia, but will be 11-19 down in the second. Uh-oh. But then you'll take 10 straight points, throw your racket in the air, fall to the floor and cry. A spot in the final and a medal are secure.
But here's the thing. You'll think you're amazing, that you've got the job done. You are the last Scot standing and while your team-mates are out ""decompressing"", you spend the rest of the day and night scrolling Twitter. 
""Omg, totes incredible @kirstgilmourr"", ""unbelievable match, you're amazing"". 
re will be hundreds of variations of that. And, hey, who doesn't want to read that? I get it. But it's detrimental to your performance in the final the next day. You relax too much and the fire is gone. You think you've already won but, let me tell you, maybe not immediately, but in one, two or three years that silver medal is going to sting.
Looking back, you'll not blame anyone in particular. This is maybe the first Games where social media was starting to take off. We didn't get any advice around it and no-one really knew the effects it could have. But I wish someone had helped you through those 24 hours better and slapped that phone out of your hand. 
I think the people forgot you were only 20. But you learned one hell of a lesson. And you'll rarely make that mistake again.
Winning Scotland's 53rd and final medal of the Games was amazing, despite all that. It was one of your biggest learning experiences. Want me to tell you about Gold Coast 2018..?
You're 23 now. You own a house, and you've been to an Olympics. You've been round the block once or twice but these Games are going to require you to draw on every single bit of that experience.
You've done the kit day, you've done your training, you've chosen your window seat and you're on your way for a third time. You'll feel a nice buzz to this Games. It feels big and important. And it will be.
You'll arrive at the village after 26 hours of travel, looking forward to some food and a lie down. Someone will point at a building and say, ""this is your home for the next four weeks"". 
Like Sam Neill standing up in that jeep in Jurassic Park, you'll take your sunglasses off, eyes wide and jaw-dropped at the sight of a 15-foot high poster of yourself decorating the front of your new flat. Well, this is new.
minton squad will quickly earn the reputation of the team that sit out in the sun too much. And it's fair. We play a year-round indoor sport. We have pasty legs and a Vitamin D deficiency. Let us have this! 
We put up a good fight in the team event and you reach the semi-final of the individual competition when your last-eight opponent withdraws after falling in the first set. You're left with adrenaline coursing through your body but with no outlet. You spend the next few minutes tingling but you're within sight of another medal.
You will be going in fresh against former World No.1 and Commonwealth gold medallist Saina Nehwal from India. Leaving you out of the singles in the team event was a good tactical decision. The last time you played her it was close. And it's close again this time but you lose 21-17 in the third set. 
Ooft. So what now? This will be a truly unique situation in your career. Lose a match in the morning then play another in the afternoon to win a major medal.
where the lesson from four years ago in Glasgow comes in. Your best friend today will be Simon. You know Simon. Tall guy, calming influence? You've been working on psychology together for the last three years? That's him! 
You will be glued to each other for the next five hours. He will get you through this. You'll go to the village together, eat (if you can), grab a smoothie and return to the venue. You will pester him with your every thought and he will tell you, ""Treat this like any other match. You're prepared for this. Just concentrate on yourself"". And every variation of that sentiment. 
You'll take a deep breath and walk out to face Michelle Li, who you lost the Glasgow final against four years earlier. Your nerves will be buzzing, but so are hers. Now here's the kicker... I have no other advice for you because I only remember the very last point. 
You will stand shuttle in hand at 20-16 and decide on a high, forehand serve. Michelle will have to just go all out for it. You've all but dragged the match away from her. She will play a full power, cross-court smash to your forehand but, before you can reach it, it hits the floor. Your head will jolt round to look at the line judge, who will throw their arms wide to signify it was out. And you will have done it. Bronze medal acquired. 
I bet your mum and pregnant sister who will be in the crowd will have a wee cry right about now. The warmest, most satisfying wave of relief will absorb you. You will celebrate with team-mates, hug friends and gaze at that medal while standing on the podium with a Saltire around your shoulders. That's the good news.
ws is that you will spend the majority of the next week crying. Sorry kid! This one has emotionally wrecked you. Leaving the village, flying home, seeing your friends and family again after four weeks... tears, tears, tears. It will be pretty out of character, but that's the Commonwealth Games for you.
Reflecting back, on the precipice of Games number four, I realise what that tension was in Gold Coast. It didn't really feel like a good, excited tension for you. It felt like a kind of grey, desperate, edge-of-seat kind of tension. And it's maybe only now that I realise why. 
You were absolutely adamant to prove - to yourself and others - that Glasgow was not a fluke. To show you can repeatedly bring that kind of quality and back up good performances with even better ones is what will fuel your fire through many, many years. It's still what will keep you going now.
So here we are at Birmingham 2022. We've got the kit, we've done the training, now all we've got to do is go and back up those good performances you've been giving lately. 
Oh, and maybe do a few extra shoulder stability exercises before this one. There's going to be a big Saltire with your name on it for the opening ceremony...
Good luck!"	/sport/commonwealth-games/62098193
