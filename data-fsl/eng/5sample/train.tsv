entertainment	Adele says she'll study for an English Literature degree after Las Vegas shows	"Brit and Grammy-winner Adele wants to study for an English Literature degree once her upcoming Las Vegas residency has been completed.
During a Q&A session with fans in Los Angeles on Monday, she said: ""After Vegas I want to get a degree in English Literature.
""If I hadn't made it singing, I think I would be an English Lit teacher.""
34-year-old singer will play a belated run of dates at the Caesars Palace hotel, beginning next month. 
""I definitely think I use my passion for English lit in what I do. I wish I'd gone to university and had that experience, but I will do it online with a tutor.""
She continued: ""That's my plan for 2025, just to get the qualification"".
ws will be music to the ears of her old English teacher Ms McDonald, who had an emotional surprise reunion with the star on stage during a star-studded ITV UK comeback concert last year.
During An Audience with Adele, the singer was asked questions by celebrities inside the London Palladium, with Harry Potter and Love Actually actress Emma Thompson asking her who had inspired her when she was younger.
She replied with a story about Ms McDonald, saying: ""She was cool and so relatable and likeable, that I really looked forward to my English lessons.""
""She left in year eight but she got me really into literature, I've always been obsessed with English and obviously now I write lyrics,"" Adele explained.
""She was so cool, so engaging, and she really made us care, and we knew that she cared about us and stuff like that.""
rformer then got a shock when it was revealed Ms McDonald was in the audience and the teacher got up to join the singer on stage.
""You're amazing darling, I am so proud of you,"" she told Adele, bringing her to tears, so much so that she had to get her make-up fixed before carrying on with the show.
Adele graduated from the Brit School of Performing Arts & Technology before beginning her climb to the top of pop star career ladder.
Other stars who returned to their studies after finding fame
After postponing her widely discussed Las Vegas residency earlier this year to her fans' dismay, due to delivery delays and Covid, Adele - who now resides in LA and doesn't like touring - is finally set to perform in Sin City from next month.
Ahead of the shows, the singer this week released a new music video to accompany her (latest) soulful break-up ballad, I Drink Wine, taken from her fourth studio album - the biggest-selling album of 2021.
Joe Talbot-directed video finds her floating down a river in a rubber ring, while holding a glass of wine in one hand and an almost-empty wine bottle in the other.
r, wearing a glittery gold dress, is seen rolling her eyes at a happy looking couple before rather carelessly tossing the now-empty wine bottle into the river.
She performed the track at February's Brit Awards, where she won album of the year for 30 and single of the year for another track, Easy On Me.
Adele has had four number one albums, entitled 19, 21, 25 and 30.  
And if all goes well with her studies we might well expect a follow-up entitled 2.1… or maybe even 1st."	/news/entertainment-arts-63410119

technology	Instagram says precise location is never shared	"Instagram says viral claims suggesting location tags on content can reveal users' exact locations are false.
Viral posts and videos have said a ""precise location"" toggle in app location settings on iOS and Android devices could share someone's exact location with other Instagram users.
Some viral posts suggested this was the result of an Instagram or iOS update.
But Instagram said this is not the case and the feature does not share locations with other users.
g was first revealed to iPhone and iOS device users in Apple's annual operating system update, iOS 14, in 2020. It was rolled out by Google for Android 12 in 2021. 
It gives users the option to provide some apps with a more accurate location.
While now viewed by some as a controversial feature, it was praised when it was first released as a way to improve user privacy on mobile devices because it offers an alternative to the blanket application of location services.
g is automatically enabled for users on apps given permission to access their location.
For apps where precise location is turned off, only an approximate location will be identified and used.
When turned on in an app's location settings it gives them permission to pinpoint an exact location using GPS for certain purposes, typically for travel or collecting background and private user data.
Its usage differs from app to app.
For instance, while Uber might use it to pinpoint your location when booking a ride, on Snapchat it is harnessed for Snap Map - where users can show their location on a map to other users if they have given the app permission or are not in private ""ghost mode"".
Some of the viral posts said that due to a new iOS or Instagram update, people can find your exact location when sharing your location on posts or Stories. 
f users were to post a general location of a city, people would still be able to see exactly where you are as a pin on a map.
went on to say this feature is being used by criminals to target people, particularly influencers, online.
ms spread as infographics, viral TikToks and memes - with some urging users to turn precise location off for Instagram immediately. 
Instagram has not responded to BBC News' request for comment on the claims, but tweeted a clarification around how it uses the setting.
Its PR team, InstagramComms, added: ""To be clear, we don't share your location with others. Similar to other social media companies, we use precise location for things like location tags and maps features.""
For instance, users with precise location switched on will see options for locations nearer to them when trying to add a geotag to an Instagram Story or post.
Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri quote-tweeted Instagram's response, reiterating that location services is a device setting on phones and not a new Instagram feature.
""We don't share your location with other people,"" he added."	/news/technology-62686375
health	No timetable for infected blood victims' compensation	"re is a ""moral case"" for compensation to be paid to people affected by the contaminated blood scandal, the government has said.
But Paymaster General Jeremy Quin told MPs he could not commit to a timetable.
In August, the government announced that 4,000 UK victims would receive interim payments of £100,000.
f thousands of people contracted HIV or hepatitis C in the 1970s and 80s after being given infected blood. More than 1,800 have died as a result.
But the figure could be significantly higher. 
In September, modelling by a group of academics commissioned by the public inquiry estimated that 26,800 people were infected after being given contaminated transfusions between 1970 and 1991. 
udy calculated that 1,820 of those died as a result, but that the number could be as high as 3,320.
quiry, chaired by retired High Court judge Sir Brian Langstaff, began taking evidence in 2018.
rim compensation announcement in August came after Sir Brian argued there was a compelling case to make payments quickly - saying victims were on borrowed time because of their failing health.
Payments have been made to those whose health is failing after developing hepatitis C and HIV, and partners of people who have died.
But families have complained that many people affected, such as bereaved parents, missed out. 
In a Commons statement on Thursday, Mr Quin said ministers accepted there was a ""moral case for the payment of compensation"".
""We made that clear in our actions with the payment of interim compensation, I now want to make it equally clear on the floor of this House,"" he said. 
He added that the scheme being developed must be ""as user friendly, supportive and as free of stress as possible, whilst being consistent with the government's approach to protecting against fraud"". 
Mr Quin said he recognised that time was ""of the essence"" and ""that it is incredibly important, given all that has happened to this community, that trust is built and retained"".
Labour spokesperson Florence Eshalomi told MPs that families were ""let down by basic failures of standards"" and were again being denied a ""prompt and thorough response"".
""While we await the conclusion of this report and inquiry, one person dies every four days. Every day that we delay this compensation is justice denied to those people,"" she said.
""Victims will not accept empty gestures. With every announcement, it seems to families that the plan changes.""
SNP spokesperson Patricia Gibson asked if the minister supported the interim scheme being extended to families and carers.
Mr Quin said this was an ""area of deep complexity"" and might have to wait for Sir Brian's final recommendations.
In what has been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS, one group infected was given regular injections of a contaminated treatment for the blood-clotting disorder, haemophilia.
A smaller group was exposed to hepatitis C though a transfusion of donated blood in surgery or childbirth.
Hepatitis C primarily affects the liver and, if left untreated, can lead to cirrhosis or cancer. It may require a full liver transplant."	/news/uk-politics-63988827
technology	Cost of living: Port Talbot mum's debt drove her to the brink	"When her 16-year-old daughter called ""petrified"" that bailiffs in full body armour were banging on the door, Julie Andrews realised she needed help.
rer was £28,000 in debt for not paying gas, electric and council tax bills and had payday loans so she could buy her three children school uniform.
""There were times I thought I wasn't going to manage and there were times I tried to take my life,"" said Julie, 57.
Julie wants to warn of high interest loans amid the cost of living crisis.
Experts estimate that one in seven people in the UK - more than seven million people - are financially excluded.
where people's credit profiles are so poor that things like loans or mobile phone contracts, for example, have higher interest rates and are more expensive. 
Wales has highest proportion of financial exclusion in Great Britain, including Julie, who was so ""ashamed"" she was one of those in financial difficulty she didn't tell anyone - even her family or closest friends.
""I had to wait for the kids to leave the house before I broke down,"" said the residential care home worker from south Wales.
""It was tough. It's something people don't want to talk about because you're ashamed.
""It was the fear, I brought my children up that you don't answer the door until I'm there - and every time I went out, I was looking over my shoulder to see if anybody was coming up the street, like debt collectors or bailiffs.""
Her money troubles began when Julie, who lives in a two-bedroom home in Port Talbot, got divorced and her father, who used to help her, died.
""It's so easy as I carried on being a single mum and started ignoring all of the bills - and before you know it, I was £28,000 in debt,"" she said.
""The kids went without but had what they had to and I went to foodbanks.""
But Julie said her children ""had to have something to open on Christmas Day or their birthdays"" and added there was ""no other way"" than to get a high interest loan.
""I don't care if I borrowed £500 and have to pay £1,500 back,"" she said. 
""They may have gone without holidays or luxury food but Christmas... no. I couldn't see my babies go without. You've got to get for your children at Christmas."" 
Julie said she found it difficult to seek help or talk to someone about her problems, almost until it was too late when she considered taking her own life. But she said she could not go through with it.
""I realised this was the lowest point you can go,"" she recalled. 
""Having lost my mother when I was young, I was now [considering] taking my children's mother from them - and more to the point, they will find me - I can't have that.""
Julie remembers the day when she finally sought financial help to stop the suffering of not just her, but her family.
""I was at work and my daughter, who was 16 at the time, she rang and said there were bailiffs at the house threatening her,"" Julie recalled.
""So I told her not to answer the door and put the phone through the letterbox and I told them politely I'm at work and stop threatening my daughter. I told them the debt is mine, not her debt. 
""I was petrified, she was petrified and I thought this is not fair on the children. My family was gobsmacked when I told them I was in so much debt.""
Although not a religious person, Julie got free help from Christians Against Poverty after seeing the not-for-profit organisation recommended on TV by money saving expert Martin Lewis.
Julie's creditors, froze her debts and helped her declare herself bankrupt. Christians Against Poverty estimate that 13% of the UK adults have fallen behind on their bills.
Now most loans have become more expensive since the Bank of England put up interest rates to 2.25% last month - the highest level for 14 years - and rates are forecast to rise to about 6% by the spring.
About 370,000 people in Wales - that's one in six, the highest rate in Scotland, England or Wales - are classed as financially excluded, according to financial analysts. 
means they do not have access to high street financial services and pay more for bills like utilities.
Analysts also say data shows county court judgements (CCJs) have doubled in Wales in the past two years, with what they say is a ""worrying"" rise in CCJs for ""small debts"" under £500.
""More people are applying for short-term loans at a higher price,"" said Steve Elliot of Cardiff-based Lexis Nexis Risk Solutions.
He added: ""Life at the moment is difficult for an increasingly number of people and having clear financial records that are able to give people access to financial and utility services in a more affordable way is a significant step to help them reduce cost.""
Christians Against Poverty (CAP) have said calls to their helpline are rising every month and in the past two months, they have tripled the amount of emergency fuel top-ups than they did last year.
Now the organisation is calling on the UK government to raise benefits in line with inflation and ""review their plans"" to cut the Energy Price Guarantee from a minimum of two years to six months.
""We are increasingly seeing people coming to us that are struggling with fuel bills,"" said Karen Homans of CAP.
""This is particularly bad for those that are reliant on using expensive oil to heat their often poorly insulated and drafty homes.
""While we work with each person to look at their debts and help them maximise their income, more and more people are finding that they simply don't have enough income to match the skyrocketing energy and cost of living increases.""
ries of financial struggles resonates with Julie and all she hopes is people in difficulty call for help before they get as deep into debt as she did.
""There are millions like me,"" she said. ""Debt can ruin your life - calling for help was the best call I made. 
""I'm petrified of slipping back into my old habits but I will never be there again. I don't know how I will stay out of debt but I'm hoping to.
""I'm still struggling. I work 30 hours a week, I'm only just keeping my head above the surface. I had 23p Universal Credit last month, I can't afford to shop every week and use the food bank occasionally. I can't do everything I want but have money to live on.""
Julie is now enjoying life as a grandmother to seven children, all under the age of six, which she could not have envisaged before she sought help with her debt.

technology	A third of children have adult social media accounts - Ofcom	"One in three children lie about their age to access adult content on social media, according to research commissioned by the regulator, Ofcom.
Many social media sites, such as Instagram, do not permit under-13s to sign up, while accounts for under-18s have limited functionality.
But researchers found children were faking their ages to skirt the rules.
Ofcom says this increases the risk of children seeing content which may be inappropriate or harmful.
Anna-Sophie Harling, from Ofcom, told BBC News the way social media platforms categorised users by age had a ""huge impact"" on the content they were shown.
She cited the recent Molly Russell inquest: ""That was a very specific case of harmful content that had very detrimental impacts and tragic outcomes on a family in the UK. 
""When we talk about potentially harmful content to under-18s, it's content that might have more significant negative consequences for under-18s because they're still developing. 
""When children are repeatedly exposed to images and videos that contain certain images, they're then essentially led to act in different ways or to think differently about themselves or their friends.""
Ofcom-commissioned research found 32% of children have an account intended for adults, while 47% of children aged eight to 15 have a user age of 16 and over.
And 60% of children under the age of 13 who use social media accounts have their own profiles, despite not being old enough.
Ms Harling said the age categorizations were meant to be ""one of the main ways"" in which platforms protected the safety of their users.
""If we want to get serious about protecting children online, we need to make sure that platforms have a way to find out exactly how old those users are,"" she said. 
""We need to work both with parents and young people, but also platforms, to make sure that the ages at which those accounts are set are done in an accurate way.""
YouTube says it has made investments to protect children, such as launching a dedicated children's app and introducing new data practices for children's content.
BBC also approached Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, for comment. A spokesperson referred to the latest work from Meta on verifying the ages of younger users, such as allowing people to ""ask others to vouch for their age"" or using technology which analyses videos people take of themselves.

business	King Charles 50p coins struck for the first time	"Manufacturing has begun of the first coin to enter general circulation carrying the image of King Charles.
50p coin has started to be struck at The Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Wales, and will enter tills, wallets and purses in December.
Sculptor Martin Jennings, who created the portrait of the King, said that witnessing the coin being produced was a ""quite remarkable experience"".
He said it took months of painstaking work to get the image right.
He used pictures of King Charles on his 70th birthday to create a likeness of the monarch, in what is the smallest work he has ever had to produce.
""It has to be an exact portrait but also that says something about the lasting values of the institution he represents,"" Mr Jennings said.
""In subtle and tiny ways, you can put these things across.""
King Charles's portrait is the first coin design undertaken by Mr Jennings, but his public sculptures include poets John Betjeman, in St Pancras Station in London, and Philip Larkin in Hull.
reverse side of the coin is a copy of the design used on the 1953 Crown struck to commemorate the Queen's coronation.
It includes the four quarters of the Royal Arms depicted within a shield. In between each shield is an emblem of the home nations: a rose, a thistle, a shamrock and a leek.
50p coins will be available for general use in December, distributed according to demand by banks, building societies and post offices. Eventually, 9.6 million 50p coins of the latest design will be made. Other denominations will be manufactured, carrying the King's image, in line with demand.

Kevin Clancy, director of The Royal Mint Museum, said: ""For many people, this will be the first time in their lives that they have seen a new monarch appear on money. 
""It represents the biggest change to UK coinage since decimalisation and will usher in a new era where the coins of Queen Elizabeth II and King Charles III co-circulate in the UK. The new memorial 50 pence marks a moment in history and honours a landmark reign that lasted for 70 years.""
Questions still remain over the relevance of coins in the modern era as people increasingly turn to cards and smartphones to pay for things.
Cash use is forecast to drop, accounting for 6% of payments by 2031, according to the banking trade body UK Finance.
Mint says that coins still portray our national identity as well as having a practical function.

politics	Conservative Gareth Davies apologises for storming out of Senedd	"Watch the moment Gareth Davies storms out of the Welsh Parliament chamber
A politician has apologised after he stormed out of the Welsh Parliament's chamber.
Conservative Vale of Clwyd Member of the Senedd (MS) Gareth Davies left during health questions after slamming his file on his desk.
Llywydd (presiding officer) Elin Jones said she would not call him to speak again until he had apologised.
One Labour MS was said to have moved seats because she felt threatened by his outburst.
Welsh Conservatives later said Mr Davies had apologised to both the Llywydd and the Labour MS involved.
Mr Davies had been asking Health Minister Eluned Morgan about plans to build a community hospital in his Vale of Clwyd constituency.
He said people had been ""promised this for a decade without a spade going in the ground or any tangible evidence that this Welsh government is doing anything"".
But Ms Morgan asked why she was answering questions from the Conservatives' spokesman on care, rather than health. 
Llywydd said political parties could decide who asks questions on their behalf.
Shortly after, Mr Davies threw a file stand to the floor, and his file to his desk, and could be heard saying ""grow up"" and ""I'm tired of this"". 
Llywydd said the minister did not need to answer his final question ""because things have got out of order"".
She asked Mr Davies to leave quietly, at which point he walked out saying: ""I will leave. It's an affront to democracy.""
Later, Labour MS Joyce Watson said one of her colleagues felt so threatened she had to move.
""I've never ever experienced behaviour like that in this chamber,"" she said.
Labour North Wales MS Carolyn Thomas was seen to move away from her seat near Mr Davies.
Llywydd said it was an ""unacceptable outburst by the member"" which ""shook us all at the time, not only those in close proximity"".
She added: ""I will expect an apology from Gareth Davies before he is called again in this chamber.
""That apology will be to me but it will be for all of us.
""Our expectations are high in this place and one member failed to reach that expectation of behaviour this afternoon.""
A Welsh Conservative Senedd spokesman said: ""Gareth has apologised to the chair and to Carolyn. He makes no apologies for raising legitimate questions with Labour ministers.
""The member was reflecting the frustration felt by many people in Wales about Labour's management of our health service."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63654594
health	Ambulance: Mum 'on edge' after boy's wait for urgent help	"mother of a four-year-old boy has said her family is ""on edge"" after an ambulance took more than 25 minutes to arrive when he had a seizure.
Oscar's mother Elizabeth told BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show that she could not stop panicking as she waited.
Her husband was asked by the 999 call handler to get a defibrillator while they waited for paramedics to arrive.
Ambulance Service has apologised and said the response time did not meet its target for the most urgent calls.
family told their story after the Ambulance Service said it was dealing with the ""highest level of pressure"" it had ever experienced.
Elizabeth said she was fearful that an ambulance would not show up in time if her son had another seizure.
She said that during the incident at their home in County Down last month Oscar initially appeared unresponsive but then started to have a seizure.
""Every minute [waiting for the ambulance] felt almost like 10 minutes,"" she said.
""I thought there was no way back from this for the length of time we waited for someone to come and [I was] just panicking the whole time.""
Ambulance Service said paramedics arrived 26 minutes after it received the call.
It said the initial information it received about Oscar's condition resulted in the call being deemed ""category two"", meaning the target response time was 18 minutes.
But the call was upgraded to ""category one"", meaning it had greater priority.
Ambulance Service said the target response time for ""category one"" calls was eight minutes.
Oscar's condition has since stabilised and he has not had a seizure since that incident but is waiting to see a consultant.
Speaking on Wednesday, the service's assistant director Mark Cochrane said that patients were being put at risk due to the level of demand within the health service in Northern Ireland.
""We have had patients who have waited many hours in excess of the performance targets,"" he said.
One problem is that some ambulance crews cannot transfer their patients to emergency departments immediately on arrival because hospitals are so busy.
refore the patients have to wait in the ambulances while they are parked outside hospitals until an appropriate space becomes available for them inside the building.
knock-on effect is that fewer ambulances are available to deal with urgent calls.
Dr Sean McGovern, an emergency medicine consultant at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald, said ""avoidable harm"" was happening.
Emergency departments were in a ""very tragic, very heart-breaking situation"", he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme.
He said that in 30 years of working in emergency medicine he had never seen the situation as bad as it was now.
Former Health and Social Care Board chief executive John Compton said the health service was in ""difficult times"".
He argued that the lack of major change and modernisation within the service and the lack of political leadership at Stormont had exacerbated the problems."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-64064270

Such was the chance of athletes suffering frostbite, freezing conditions at the Winter Olympics in Beijing had already seen the blue riband men's 50km cross-country ski delayed by an hour - and shortened to a 30km event.
But even those alterations could not save Lindholm from an ""unbearable"" fate.
mmediate concern for the 24-year-old, in the aftermath of completing the final event of his debut Olympic Games, was thawing out his frozen penis.
A heat pack eventually helped the Finn salvage the situation at the end of what was a gruelling race.
However, having spent almost one hour and 16 minutes out on the course in howling winds and appendage-threatening temperatures of -17C, he was, understandably, left in a tremendous amount of pain.
""You can guess which body part was a little bit frozen when I finished,"" Lindholm told Finnish media.
""It was one of the worst competitions I've been in. It was just about battling through.

FN Meka is an artificial intelligence musician given the appearance of a black male cyborg.
But Capitol Music Group (CMG) faced a backlash for signing the rapper.
In a statement announcing they had severed ties, CMG offered its ""deepest apologies to the black community for our insensitivity"". 
FN Meka currently has more than 500,000 monthly Spotify subscribers and more than one billion views on its TikTok account.
Its Instagram account, which has more than 220,000 followers, has been made private.
FN Meka's songs are performed by an anonymous black man, according to Anthony Martini who is one of the cofounders of Factory New, a company responsible for the AI.
In an interview in 2021, he said a human voice ""performs the vocals, but we are working towards the ability to have a computer come up with and perform its own words - and even collaborate with other computers as co-writers"".
Before CMG dropped the rapper, black activist group Industry Blackout sent them an open letter saying FN Meka was ""offensive"" and ""a direct insult to the Black community and our culture"".

health	Derby puppy that survived parvovirus home for Christmas	"A puppy that nearly died after contracting a virus will be spending his first Christmas with his family at home.
Ralph the cavapoo was just over eight weeks old when he was taken to Scarsdale Vets in Derby with diarrhoea and unusual behaviour.
He was quickly diagnosed with having parvovirus and was ""very touch and go"".
His owner Rebecca Dean said having their ""little fighter"" home would make it a good Christmas.
Mrs Dean, 29, said they had only had Ralph - a cavalier King Charles spaniel/poodle cross - for 24 hours before taking him to the vets on 25 September. 
She said: ""We noticed that he had constant diarrhoea and sickness, not eating and just not being a puppy.
""He started collapsing next to his water bowl.""
Seamus O'Cathail was one of the vets that treated Ralph.
He said: ""It was very quickly identified that he was infected with parvovirus.
""Parvovirus is an intestinal virus - it attacks the small intestines of a dog. Typically it affects young dogs, puppies would be most at risk.
""They can die very quickly from an infection if they're not properly treated.""
Ralph spent about 10 days in intensive care and was very close to developing sepsis.
Mr O'Cathail added: ""For a lot of that time he was very touch and go.""
Mrs Dean said it was ""quite scary"" for her family and she had to explain to her children that Ralph might not be coming home.
However, after a long stay at the vets, Ralph did get better.
Mrs Dean said having him at home this Christmas would be special.
""He's our little fighter. He's got plenty of Christmas presents - he is a very spoilt little doggie.
""It's going to be a very good Christmas,"" she added.

business	Government borrowing lower than expected in April	"Government borrowing was lower than expected in April, although the figure was still the fourth-highest total for the month since records began.
Borrowing - the difference between spending and tax income - was £18.6bn, down £5.6bn from April last year.
Office for National Statistics also cut its estimate for borrowing in the previous financial year.
One analyst said the figures would put pressure on the chancellor to ""go big"" on a support package for households.  
With the cost of living rising at its fastest pace for 40 years, there have been calls for the government to provide extra help.
Opposition parties have called for a windfall tax on energy firms, and while the government has resisted such a measure so far, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said ""no option is off the table"" to tackle rising living costs.
ONS cut its estimate for borrowing during the previous financial year by £7.2bn to £144.6bn, although this was still the third-highest financial year borrowing total since records began in 1947.
""The lower-than-expected public borrowing of £18.6bn in April and the downward revisions to borrowing in 2021-22 will only add to the pressure on the chancellor to go big when finalising the imminent support package for households,"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
However, he added: ""We think any support will be small and targeted rather than big and widespread.""
Borrowing surged during the pandemic as the government spent billions to support the economy. However, borrowing has fallen back as the economy has recovered and as the government ended measures such as the furlough scheme.
April's borrowing total was lower than expected, with the government's independent forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility - having predicted £19.1bn.
month saw the first contributions to government revenues of the increase to National Insurance. But spending during April also included the £3bn cost of the council tax rebate, under which many households will receive £150 to help with higher energy bills.
Interest payments on government borrowing were £4.4bn, which was lower than expected. However, analysts expect this figure to surge in the months ahead, as interest paid on government bonds rises with increases in the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation.
""Following the latest spike in RPI inflation, we now expect monthly interest spending to reach an eye-watering £16bn in June,"" said Michal Stelmach, senior economist at KPMG UK.
Chancellor Rishi Sunak, said: ""While we are doing what we can to help families deal with rising prices, inflation is also pushing up our spending on debt interest - which is expected to reach £83bn this year.
""We must take a balanced and responsible approach to support people now, while also not burdening future generations, and we're on track to drive public debt down by 2024-25.""
Government debt - the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years - stood at £2.35 trillion in April. 
figure almost exceeds the size of the UK economy, with debt having reached 95.7% of gross domestic product (GDP). 
A separate survey of companies indicated that growth in the UK's private sector has slowed to its weakest in 15 months.
monthly purchasing managers' index - which surveys senior managers at companies who take buying and hiring decisions - fell sharply in May to 51.8 from 58.2 in April, although a figure above 50 still implies activity is growing.
Manufacturers reported the steepest drop in export orders since June 2020. A number of goods producers cited Brexit-related trade frictions as the main factor contributing to lower export sales in May, especially in relation to new customs rules, extra documentation requirements and other complexities with EU trade. 
Business expectations eased to the lowest for two years in May amid worries about the global economic outlook and downbeat projections for consumer spending."	/news/business-61561682
health	London's air ambulance takes part in 'whole blood transfusion' trial	"London's air ambulance will be the first NHS service to take part in a new ""whole blood transfusion"" trial.
me will give some patients transfusions that include platelets, in a bid to improve their chances of survival.
Currently, air ambulance patients and soldiers needing battlefield transfusions can receive plasma and red blood cells, but not platelets. 
It is thought including platelets could cut treatment time and help clotting.
Platelets are not currently used in transfusions on air ambulances due to the difficulty of storing that particular blood component.
rial was developed after evidence from Army medics working in battlefields in Afghanistan suggested this type of transfusion could improve survival rates among patients who suffered major trauma.
Beginning on Thursday, the NHS will test the effectiveness of the transfusions across 10 UK air ambulance services, with the capital's air ambulance being the first to begin using them.
rvices will assess how whole blood transfusion helps in treating patients who have suffered serious accident or injury, compared to standard care.
NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) service said 848 patients would be recruited for the trial over the next two years - with half receiving usual care, and the other half receiving whole blood transfusions which will come from donors with O negative blood, the universal blood type.
It added that if the trial was a success, it would change pre-hospital trauma transfusions and battlefield care.
Dr Laura Green, co-chief investigator for the trial, said: ""We hope that [the trial] will show there are logistical and procedural benefits in giving a blood transfusion of all of the components in a single bag; and ultimately improved outcomes for patients.
""We are also incredibly grateful to our O Rh negative donors, whose universal donor blood is critical in trauma transfusion, including in this trial.""
funded by by NHSBT, the air ambulance charities and the Ministry of Defence.
Prof Jason Smith, co-chief investigator from the Ministry of Defence, said: ""We have known that blood transfusions save lives in patients with life-threatening haemorrhage for over 100 years, but the exact nature and optimal timing of those transfusions is still not known.
""This study will hopefully give us the answer as to whether whole blood is better than our current standard care in terms of clinical and cost effectiveness.""

H&M has informed customers it would close the doors of its Tavern Street store in Ipswich on 27 November.
It said it was in response to a ""rapid change in customer behaviour"".
David Ellesmere, leader of Labour-run Ipswich Borough Council, said it ""would have been much better if they'd been trading in the run up to Christmas"". 
He said it was ""certainly disappointing"" that the fashion giant, which occupies the art-deco building on the corner of Tower Street, was to shut.
A spokesperson for the Swedish firm, considered to be the world's second-biggest clothing retailer, said it wanted to be ""where our customers are"".
""We continuously evaluate how we should invest in stores and sometimes decisions must be made to enable long-term growth,"" they said.

politics	Rishi Sunak: No 91,000 target for civil service job cuts	"Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has scrapped a target of 91,000 civil service job cuts and ordered departments to find efficiency savings instead.
Downing Street said reductions in staff were needed but the government would not be putting a specific number on it.
91,000 target was introduced when Boris Johnson was prime minister.
ft in policy comes as Mr Sunak's government seeks to shore up the UK's finances to fill a gap worth an estimated £50bn.
reasury has warned of spending cuts and tax rises ahead of a financial statement by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt on 17 November.
ment was delayed by two weeks after Mr Sunak replaced Liz Truss as prime minister, following a period of economic turmoil, exacerbated by her tax-cutting mini-budget in September.
rget of reducing the Civil Service by around a fifth predates both Ms Truss and Mr Sunak.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has now quit government and returned to the backbenches,  was working towards the target when he was a Cabinet Office minister under Mr Johnson. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg: ""During an issue with the cost of living... you need to have control of budgets""
At the time, Secretary Simon Case sent a letter to civil servants, telling them the aim was to return to 2016 staffing levels within three years.
re were 384,000 civil servants employed in 2016 - the lowest number since World War Two - but as the UK prepared to leave the EU, numbers steadily rose until they reached 475,000 at the end of last year.
But on Tuesday, Mr Sunak's official spokesman said reductions in civil servant numbers would be up to individual departments, and no targets would be set.
In a tweet, the Trades Union Congress wrote: ""Big win for civil servant trade unions.""
Writing to civil servants, Mr Sunak said: ""Together, we must make sure every taxpayer pound goes as far as it possibly can.
""I do not believe that top-down targets for Civil Service headcount reductions are the right way to do that.
""Instead, the chancellor and I will be asking every government department to look for the most effective ways to secure value and maximise efficiency within budgets so that we can use taxpayers' money sustainably in the long term.""
Cabinet Office said government departments ""have been asked to look for the most effective ways to maximise efficiency within their budgets"".
A spokesperson said: ""It is the role of a responsible government to identify how to deliver the best outcomes for the public as efficiently as possible.""

politics	Stormont: MLA pay cut bill passed in House of Lords	"Legislation to give the Northern Ireland secretary powers to cut assembly members' salaries has passed all its hurdles at Westminster.
It was approved in the House of Lords on Monday night.
Executive Formation Bill was fast-tracked after the  government introduced it last month.
But it remains unclear when Chris Heaton-Harris could choose to impose a pay cut.
gislation will also have to receive Royal Assent before it comes into force, although this is merely a formality. 
Last week, during a debate in the House of Commons on the bill, Mr Heaton-Harris said he would ""act rapidly"" to cut MLA wages.  
He previously indicated he would move to impose a reduction of 27.5%, or just over £14,000, reducing MLAs' incomes from £51,500 to £37,337.
will also extend the time period for parties to return to power-sharing government at Stormont.
If the DUP refuses to end its boycott of the Stormont institutions by this Thursday, the bill will give Mr Heaton-Harris the option to either call an election, which would be for some point between mid-January and the beginning of March, or extend the deadline by six weeks to 19 January.
If nothing changes by that extended deadline, an election could take place by 13 April.
gislation will also clarify the ""limited decision-making"" powers that civil servants now have in the absence of ministers.
Extra provisions are also being made to allow a regional rate to be set, should an executive not be in place, as well as powers for the approval of some public appointments.
During Monday's debate in the Lords, Baroness Ritchie, a former SDLP minister, said the bill ""represents a further manifestation of political failure"".
""It is the secretary of state putting a sticking plaster on a running sore of ongoing political paralysis, and kicking the proverbial can down the road,"" she added.
Former DUP Education Minister, Lord Weir gave his first speech since taking up his seat in the Lords.
He described the bill as a ""reluctant necessity brought about by the failure to deal with problems caused by the protocol"".
""Holding an election at the minute would act as a distraction from resolving issues but would also not tell us anything different,"" he said.
Former Secretary of State, Lord Murphy said the government needed to ""think carefully"" about the January deadline it was imposing.
""Unless it's a clever ruse, which I don't think it is, it needs to be re-thought,"" he added.
Northern Ireland Minister Lord Caine described the bill as ""highly unsatisfactory"" but that it remained a ""necessary stopgap"" to allow decisions on public services to be taken. 
He said the bill was never intended to set an ""indefinite deadline"", but rather a short window to allow space for negotiations on the protocol between the UK and EU."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63867082

business	Pensions, savings and mortgages - your questions answered	"Since the announcement of the government's mini-budget in September, financial markets have been in turmoil, with investors concerned about how tax cuts would be paid for.
Some pension funds risked collapse, and the Bank of England had to step in to lower that risk.
Meanwhile, five-year mortgage rates hit 12-year highs. Mortgage rates had been rising for months, but increased sharply after the mini-budget.
BBC personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey answers your questions about pensions and mortgages.
Heather Wing asks whether, following the deadline from the Bank of England, her occupational pension is safe.
It is correct that the Bank of England has told pension funds that its emergency bond-buying operation will end this week.
rgeted at a specific section of the pensions sector. Importantly, the warning does not extend to the pension savers themselves.
Even if you have a so-called defined benefit pension, that will be safe, experts say.
If one of these pension funds did get into trouble, then the employer is legally obliged to pump money into the scheme. In the unlikely event that doing so puts the employer out of business then there is a safety net called the Pension Protection Fund.
Read more: How safe is my pension?
Andy Atkinson, from Rugby, asks whether he should be worried about his defined contribution and defined benefit pensions.
First things first, some definitions.
A defined contribution pension is when you build up a pot of pension savings which is invested. On retirement, you have various options.
One of those is to buy an annuity with all, or part, of that pot. Recent events mean annuity deals are actually better than they have been for some time.
A defined benefit pension is a bit different. It sees the amount you receive in retirement depend on how long you have been in the scheme and your salary during that time.
Some of the funds which control these pensions have been at the centre of the turbulence of recent days.
However, pensions consultants stress that, whatever type of pension you have, it is safe.
Don Brown wants to know: ""Will the state pension keep up with the cost of living?""
re is some upheaval in the pensions sector at the moment, but that will not affect your state pension.
government has already committed to honouring the triple-lock. So, your state pension next April will rise in line with the highest of inflation, wages, or 2.5%.
Inflation - the annual rate of rising prices - will clearly be the highest, at about 10% or so. We will get that number next week, when the next set of official inflation figures is published.
Of course, pensioners are facing higher prices now, but the backstop of the triple lock always lags behind the current situation - for better or worse.
Moving on to mortgages, Callum, from Leeds, is saving for a first home and wants to know what help is available.
He says: ""I make just under £1,500 a month after tax. National Insurance and Income Tax reductions will only save me £16 a month, meanwhile prices of everything are skyrocketing.""
Clearly as you watch mortgages getting more expensive, it may feel like buying a home is increasingly difficult.
Ministers will point to the help offered in the mini-budget, which means first-time buyers in England and Northern Ireland will only pay stamp duty on properties above £425,000, rather than £300,000, as well as discounts above that.
Savings rates are improving, and house price rises look set to stall or reverse, according to experts.
But, as is always the case, the security of your job and income, and how much you earn, will be key factors when judging what home you can afford.
Ethan Jones from Wolverhampton asks: ""What's the worst that can happen if I can't afford to pay my mortgage for say, three consecutive months?""
You are technically defined as being in arrears after missing two or more months of payments.
universal advice from debt charities here is to avoid putting your head in the sand.
If you are struggling, or know you will struggle, to make your monthly repayments, then you should contact your lender. Charities can also offer free, independent guidance.
Your lender is obliged to treat you fairly and consider any request to pay, for example, just part of the payment for a short period.
It is not allowed to repossess your home unless all reasonable attempts to resolve the situation have failed.
Kam Wan asks: ""Are my savings safe in a bank or building society?""
question that was asked a lot during the financial crisis over a decade ago, which was a very different scenario.
wer is yes. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme completely protects the first £85,000 saved per person, per financial institution if a bank or building society goes bust.
If you have more savings than that, experts suggest putting it into different accounts with different providers.
And, just to stress, there is no suggestion of a threat to the future of any banks or building societies right now.

business	Firms will close this winter without help, warns business group	"Businesses ""will close their doors this winter"" if they are not given support with soaring energy bills, the head of the British Chambers of Commerce says.
Baroness Ruby McGregor-Smith said the government needed to provide measures on the same scale as at the height of the Covid pandemic to help firms.
She said the country needed an ""action plan"" to be delivered next week.
Her comments come as Chancellor Nadim Zahawi said companies could be given VAT reductions or other tax breaks.
mes reported Mr Zahawi has been working on a multi-billion pound emergency energy strategy for the new prime minister, who will be elected by the Conservative Party and take office on Monday.
Baroness Ruby, a Conservative peer, said the scale of support for businesses was going to have to be ""particularly considerable"" for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs).
Unlike households, businesses are not protected by an energy price cap, meaning their bills are usually higher. Pubs in particular are seeing their energy costs soar by as much as 300%, and bosses of six of the country's largest breweries have called for ""immediate government intervention"".
""One of the big measures we are asking for, and have been for some time, is for Covid-style support to be given by measure of a government emergency energy grant for all SMEs,"" said Baroness Ruby.
""I think unless there is immediate and urgent support, we will see many businesses close their doors this winter.""Warning firms will close this winter without help
BCC president said measures reportedly suggested by Mr Zahawi, including reductions in VAT and business rates for retail and hospitality and tax breaks for energy intensive industries, was the ""right territory"" to help people this winter.
""We cannot be in a situation where more and more businesses are shutting down, because of costs that are absolutely outside of their control,"" she added.
""We are not just talking about big businesses, we are talking more and more and more SMEs which are the lifeblood of our economy. 
""They need more support now as they did during Covid, this for us is no different. All we have had so far, publicly, are many words and not an action plan. Now we need an action plan, we need a plan and we need it delivered next week.""
Pressure is growing on the new prime minister to act quickly on the rising cost of living, with inflation, the rate at which prices rise, at 10.1%. 
Wholesale gas prices have been increasing since last year but have worsened recently because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin's decision to squeeze energy supplies to Europe. 
Small businesses across a number of industries have voiced their concerns over rising energy bills.
government has previously said no new policies will be announced until the new prime minister, either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak, is announced on Monday.
Restaurants will just close until spring - Tom Kerridge
On Thursday, chef Tom Kerridge told the BBC he had been quoted £35,000 a month by his electricity supplier at one of his restaurants. The business currently pays £5,000 per month.
He said many people in hospitality were considering ""mothballing"" their businesses, which means closing through the winter because they cannot afford to remain open.
""The numbers are so ridiculous and ludicrous that no wonder so many businesses are closing, [or] talking of closing,"" he added. 
Bank of England has forecast that the UK economy will fall into recession later this year, whereas the BCC has predicted a bleaker picture and a recession hitting sooner, with negative economic growth in three consecutive quarters before the end of 2022. 
Baroness Ruby said she did not believe government support would prevent a recession, but added the measures would help reduce the impacts of a shrinking economy.
A Treasury spokesman told the BBC preparations were being made on various ""options"" for the next prime minister to make firm police decisions on.
""We understand that people are struggling with rising prices, and while we can't shield everyone from the global challenges we face, we're supporting British businesses to navigate the months ahead,"" he said.
""We've cut taxes for hundreds of thousands of businesses by increasing the Employment Allowance and slashing fuel duty. We've also introduced a 50% business rates relief for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses and put the brakes on bill increases by freezing the business rates multiplier, worth £4.6bn over the next five years."""	/news/business-62764121

American singer and actress was best known for her title track in the 1980 film Fame, as well as co-writing and singing the smash hit Flashdance... What a Feeling, for which she won an Oscar and a Grammy.
She later starred in films opposite Clint Eastwood and Tatum O'Neal. 
Cara's publicist, who announced her death, said she died at home in Florida but the cause is ""currently unknown"".
Born in 1959 in the Bronx, New York City, Cara was the youngest of five children and started her career on Spanish-language TV. Her father was Puerto Rican and her mother, Cuban-American.
Having recorded music as a child, both in Spanish and English, she went on to appear in a number of on-and-off Broadway musicals. 
But it was in 1980 that Cara shot to fame when she bagged the role of Coco Hernandez - and sang Fame's title track. 
Her performance earned her a Best Actress nomination at the 1981 Golden Globe Awards. 
Cara later co-wrote and sang the vocals for Flashdance… What A Feeling, from the 1983 blockbuster Flashdance, and won a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance as well as an Academy Award for Best Original Song.
Flashdance went on to become the third-highest-grossing film of 1983.
Judith A Moose, Cara's publicist, praised her  as a ""beautifully gifted soul whose legacy will live forever through her music and films"".
She also said Cara had been working on forthcoming projects when she died, which she and the singer's manager now plan to finish.
""She'd want that,"" Ms Moose said of her client via her official Twitter page. "	/news/world-us-canada-63767710
