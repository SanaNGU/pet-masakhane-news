entertainment	National Television Awards: Ant and Dec to miss ceremony after catching Covid	"Ant and Dec have both caught Covid, so will miss the National Television Awards (NTAs) in London on Thursday.
joked on Instagram: ""Sadly it's true... we even get ill together!""
uo have won the best TV presenter prize for the past 20 years, and could now scoop their 21st consecutive award - unless Alison Hammond, Graham Norton or Bradley Walsh can beat them.
remony will be live on ITV from Wembley Arena after being postponed following the death of the Queen.
BBC's EastEnders, ITV's Emmerdale and Netflix's Bridgerton and Heartstopper all have three nominations each. 
will be hosted by The Masked Singer presenter Joel Dommett, with performances from singers Lewis Capaldi and Sam Ryder, who has replaced Robbie Williams as the opening attraction.
Here are some more things to look out for:
ITV's chief executive last month backed Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield after the hosts were accused of jumping the queue for the Queen's lying-in-state.
NTAs are voted for by the public, though, so it has been up to the people to decide whether the pair will keep their crowns as daytime queen and king, after This Morning won the daytime award in 2021 - or whether they'll be dethroned by Loose Women, The Chase or The Repair Shop.
Notably, neither Holly nor Phil are up for best TV presenter this year, as they have been in previous years. But the nominations were announced in August, long before ""queue-gate"".
Ant and Dec, Line of Duty, Corrie and more -  watch the highlights of the National Television Awards 2021
Ant and Dec underlined their status as the nation's favourite TV hosts last year, after their 20th (yes, 20th) consecutive win in the presenting category.
me they didn't win the award was in 2000, to Michael Barrymore. Most of the nominees in this year's rising star category, including Heartstopper's Joe Locke and Kit Connor, were not even born then.
While the duo will be absent through illness on Thursday, the question is whether voters are sick of seeing them win the same award every year.
Geordie double act are also nominated in the entertainment show category for Saturday Night Takeaway and I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, as well as best talent show for Britain's Got Talent - so there's a good chance we may see an acceptance speech made over video call in their PJs at some stage.
uthored documentary category includes heartfelt films chronicling the lives of Kate Garraway and her husband Derek, who has been critically ill with Covid; Julia Bradbury with breast cancer; Paddy and Christine McGuinness alongside their three autistic children; as well as Katie Price and her disabled son Harvey.
final nominee focuses on The Wanted's late singer Tom Parker. Inside My Head, about the music star's brain tumour, was aired in October 2021 - just five months before he died at the age of 33.
Elsewhere, a new category for best expert will see Clarkson's Farm's breakout star Kaleb Cooper, 24, take on 96-year-old broadcasting legend Sir David Attenborough, Money Show Live host Martin Lewis and The Repair Shop's Jay Blades.
A special recognition award will be given to actor and comedy legend Sir Lenny Henry. Previous recent winners have included the Line of Duty team, Sir Michael Palin and David Dimbleby.

health	How play therapy helps children in hospital	"Like any six-year-old, Afonso loves his toys but play has taken on a different meaning since he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia two-and-a-half years ago. 
A big part of his hospital experience is the play area and the NHS play technicians. They support the young patients, playing games and interacting with toys with them.
gy for children's play at Kingston Hospital has been donated by Starlight. The charity is fundraising to provide more play resources to children's wards across the country. 
r Christmas appeal aims to raise £400,000 to bring play to every seriously ill child who needs it. The charity estimates there will be over 1.3 million A&E and hospital admissions for under 18s in England this December alone."	/news/uk-england-london-63990353
technology	How to check if your Instagram posts are being hidden	"Instagram has launched a new tool to let you know if your posts are barred from being recommended to other users.
Previously, people were not told if intervention by a platform meant posts did not appear in other people's feeds - a process known as ""shadow banning"".
Instagram does not use that term. It says the new tool will inform users if there are restrictions on their account because they broke certain rules.
Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, said the decision was about ""transparency"".
""Sometimes your account can end up in a state where it's not eligible for your photos and videos to show up in [our] recommendations,"" he said. 
""If you have posted things that violate our 'recommendability' guidelines or recommendation guidelines... you can end up in a state where your content won't be recommended,"" Mr Mosseri explains.
Instagram users will be able to edit or delete posts which have fallen foul of the platform's rules. They will also be able to appeal to Instagram if they feel any content has been flagged in error.
People can check the status of their account in the Instagram app by selecting their profile, opening the menu, then selecting: settings, account, and account status.
Dr Carolina Are, a content moderation researcher at the Centre For Digital Citizens at Northumbria University, said Instagram has historically had a major issue with people having posts 'hidden' without their knowledge.
""The platform did not notify us about shadow banning,"" she said. ""For ages, Instagram denied that it was ever a thing.""
Dr Are is also a content creator on Instagram, where she often posts videos as a pole dance instructor - and says she has experienced so-called shadow banning herself.
""I personally received an apology [from Instagram] for the shadow ban of pole-dancing in 2019,"" she said. 
""They said the hashtags were blocked 'in error'... this is essentially shadow banning.""
Shadow banning can be a problem because if people are not told they have fallen foul of the rules, it means they're unable to appeal the decision or fix any mistake.
It can sometime lead to amusing consequences, with one Reddit user previously telling the BBC he didn't know he'd been shadow banned - and accidentally spent a year talking to himself.
re are some benefits to the practice, however. It allows big tech companies to block harmful content from spreading, limiting disinformation.
But Dr Are says her research has found it has had a disproportionate impact on marginalised communities.
""I think creators are very, very worried about shadow banning,"" she said. ""So it's only fair that Instagram is moving to do something about it.""
She said the problem is exacerbated by a lack of real people involved in the moderation process, which is often automated.
In her role as a researcher, Dr Are has spoken to people whose accounts were removed from Instagram due to violating its policies.
She claims to have spoken to some content creators who lost their accounts and tried to appeal, who said they weren't able to speak to a person involved in moderation.
""I still think it's a bit of a cosmetic and performative change,"" she said. ""As good as this is, without investing in human moderation, we are just going nowhere."""	/news/technology-63907699

business	House prices climb 11% despite cost of living squeeze	"House prices are continuing to rise despite the growing cost of living crisis.
Nationwide said prices climbed 11% in the last 12 months, although the rise over the last month was just 0.1%.
""The housing market has retained a surprising degree of momentum,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist.
But he said that there were ""tentative signs of a slowdown in activity"".
July figure was slightly ahead of June's annual rise of 10.7% and left the average house at £271,209.
""Demand continues to be supported by strong labour market conditions, where the unemployment rate remains near 50-year lows and with the number of job vacancies close to record highs,"" said Mr Gardner.
""At the same time, the limited stock of homes on the market has helped keep upward pressure on house prices.""
Bank of England is expected to increase interest rates by as much as 0.5% on Thursday when and that could ""exert a cooling impact on the market"" he said.
""We continue to expect the market to slow as pressure on household budgets intensifies in the coming quarters, with inflation set to reach double digits towards the end of the year.""
First-timer buyer mortgage completions remain around 5% above pre-pandemic levels, according to the Nationwide, despite the rising affordability pressures caused by the cost of living squeeze.
""First-time buyer numbers remain strong but that is likely to reflect significant financial input from the Bank of Mum and Dad, as deposit levels rise along with house prices and interest rates,"" said Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients.
Borrowers remained extremely keen to secure a fixed-rate mortgage before rates go up again, as they are expected to later this week, he said. ""Minds are focused on getting deals done before the cost of borrowing inevitably rises further still.""
""Today's market is being fuelled by people's desperation to find a home before interest rates rise further and the cost of living crisis bites deeper,"" said Nicholas Finn, managing director of Garrington Property Finders.
ursday's expected bank rate rise to 1.75% will have a ""dampening effect on the market,"" said Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest.
She predicted the effects of soaring inflation and the cost-of-living squeeze will ""add more pressure on the property sector"".
""There are a barrage of challenges to come - from the surge in energy prices in October, to runaway inflation continuing to outstrip wage growth - and the pressure on household finances will intensify.""
Gabriella Dickens, senior UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said rises in mortgage rates will cause buyer demand to cool further.
""The rate for a two-year 75% loan-to-value fixed-rate mortgage already has increased to 2.88% in June from 1.57% in December - the fastest six-monthly increase since at least 1995,"" she said.
uld rise to about 3.1% by the end of the year if the Bank of England increased rates in line with current market expectations, she added.
If the recession many are predicting sees unemployment rise sharply, the property market will invariably take a hit, said Andrew Montlake, managing director of mortgage broker Coreco. 
""Even then, though, the impact on prices will be limited due to the abject lack of supply and homes being built."""	/news/business-62390578
politics	Aberconwy asylum hotel plan attacked by Welsh government	"It is unacceptable that a north Wales hotel is housing asylum seekers without the Welsh government, councils or police being told, a minister has said.
Labour Social Justice minister Jane Hutt warned the Home Office risks fostering extremism and said the hotel was in a rural location with none of the specialist services needed nearby.
g used to ease overcrowding at Kent detention centres.
Home Office said hotels provided a short-term, safe solution.
BBC Wales is not naming the hotel for safeguarding reasons.
Ms Hutt compared the situation to the lack of consultation over Penally, an army camp used to house asylum seekers which was closed after it was criticised by inspectors.
""The Welsh government is aware of the pressures faced by the Home Office in providing accommodation for asylum seekers,"" Ms Hutt said in a letter, seen by BBC Wales, to the UK Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick. 
""However, it is unacceptable that your department has failed to contact or notify the Welsh government, members of the Senedd and key partners such as local authorities, health boards and the police in Wales before putting these arrangements in place.""
She said the north Wales hotel was being used ""with no prior consultation or notification of use"".
Ms Hutt said that without proper engagement ""there could well be a lack of trust and confidence within the wider community; this in turn could result in increased risks for the asylum seekers themselves. 
""We have particular concerns about the impact on community cohesion within the areas of hotels being established, which may also experience increased, adverse interest from hostile organisations which are active within Wales. 
""It is short-sighted to focus dogmatically on one Home Office aim - to reduce the costs of the asylum system - in ways which are likely to foster extremism which the Home Office seeks to eliminate.""
Manston asylum numbers are back below 1,600, says Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick.
Ms Hutt added the north Wales hotel is in a rural location ""with none of the specialist services which asylum populations require - including traumatic stress mental health services, communicable disease specialists, English for Speakers of Other Language tutors, immigration legal advisors, interpreters, or refugee drop-in services"".
She asked that Welsh ministers are informed in the same way and at the same time as MPs and councils, urged the Home Office to use contingency accommodation and ""provide sufficient funding"" to minimise the risk to residents at hotels and within the community.
Mr Jenrick told the Commons on Monday that he had agreed with officials that all MPs should be informed of new facilities opening in their constituency ahead of time.
Earlier this week Conservative Aberconwy Senedd member Janet Finch Saunders said the decision had sparked local anger.
Writing to the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, she expressed ""serious concerns"" and demanded the decision be reversed.
Conwy council said it was also not given advance warning of the Home Office plan.
An email from the operators to local politicians on Saturday, seen by the BBC, said: ""With the current crisis in Kent in relation to the overcrowding of detention centres, the Home Office have reached out asking us to take a short-term accommodation contract, which we felt was the right thing to do.
""This was an urgent project for them and we have been contracted with immediate effect.
""The agreement we have entered appoints us as the host accommodation provider, but all security is provided by the Home Office.""
Home Office said it cost £5.6m every day to house more than 37,000 asylum seekers in hotels.
A spokesman added: ""We have received Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt's concerns and thank the Welsh government for their continued cooperation thus far.
""We accept that while hotels do not provide a long-term solution, they do ensure accommodation provided is safe, secure, leaves no-one destitute and is appropriate for each individual's needs."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63570024
politics	Plaid Cymru: Adam Price concerned over claims of 'awful culture' in party	"Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has said he is ""concerned"" over claims of an ""awful culture"" in his party.
Mr Price promised to ask all party staff to share their experiences and said he would learn from them.
But he declined to comment on claims he knew of allegations against a party Senedd member a year ago.
Several sources have said there is substantial unease within the party about the way allegations have been dealt with.
Welsh Parliament's Standards Commissioner is investigating serious allegations made against Rhys ab Owen, MS for South Wales central.
Mr ab Owen is suspended in the meantime. Sources have claimed the allegations were in raised in Plaid a year ago.
BBC Wales also learned earlier this week the party has also commissioned a HR firm to look into misconduct allegations in Plaid Cymru, unrelated to Rhys ab Owen.
One source spoke of an ""awful culture"" in the party and a ""lack of leadership"".
Speaking to BBC Radio Wales Drive with Gareth Lewis, Mr Price said: ""I've made it very clear that Plaid Cymru, like all parties, has to work to improve its culture and ensure that it has a safe and inclusive environment for everyone.
""I'm concerned to read this and we're committed to ensuring that we do practice those values of inclusivity and creating a safe space.
""As a result of these comments, we will be reaching out to all our staff, giving them a space to share their experiences confidentially.
""And we are committed, absolutely, to taking any necessary action as a consequence of learning from them.""
Asked if he knew about the Rhys ab Owen allegations a year ago, he said: ""It's not possible for us to comment on a case which is being investigated at the moment.""
He said he also could not comment on the HR firm's probe."	/news/uk-wales-politics-63669944
sports	Tokyo Olympics: German pentathlon coach thrown out for punching horse	"A German coach has been thrown out of the Olympics for appearing to punch a horse who was refusing to jump or trot during the modern pentathlon.
Coach Kim Raisner was heard on German TV urging tearful athlete Annika Schleu to ""really hit"" the horse while she struggled to control Saint Boy during the showjumping round of Friday's women's event.
Schleu had been leading the event before the equestrian, where athletes are given just 20 minutes to bond with a horse they have never ridden.
Modern pentathlon's governing body, the UIPM, said it had reviewed video footage that appeared to show Raisner - who competed at the 2004 Olympics in modern pentathlon - striking the horse with her fist.
""Her actions were deemed to be in violation of the UIPM competition rules, which are applied to all recognised modern pentathlon competitions including the Olympic Games,"" the governing body said in a statement.
""The UIPM Executive Board [EB] has given a black card to the Germany team coach Kim Raisner, disqualifying her from the remainder of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games.
""The EB decision was made today at the Tokyo Stadium before the resumption of the men's modern pentathlon competition.""
Saint Boy is not among the horses due to be ridden during Saturday's men's modern pentathlon competition.

entertainment	Henry Cavill: British actor will not return as Superman	"Actor Henry Cavill has been dropped as Superman by the new bosses of DC Studios, less than two months after he announced his return to the role.
""I have just had a meeting with James Gunn and Peter Safran and it's sad news, everyone. I will, after all, not be returning as Superman,"" Cavill said.
""After being told by the studio to announce my return back in October, prior to their hire, this news isn't the easiest, but that's life.""
He said there were no hard feelings.
""The changing of the guard is something that happens. I respect that,"" he continued, in his Instagram post.
""James and Peter have a universe to build. I wish them and all involved with the new universe the best of luck, and the happiest of fortunes.""
Gunn and Safran took over DC Studios in late October, just after Cavill made a surprise appearance as the Man of Steel during the credits of the Dwayne Johnson film Black Adam.
British actor then posted a video telling fans: ""I wanted to make it official, that I am back as Superman."" The Black Adam cameo was ""just a very small taste of things to come"", he added.
Cavill played the legendary role in the 2013 Man Of Steel film, as well as in 2016's Batman v Superman alongside Ben Affleck, and in Justice League the following year.
Following the announcement, some fans have been speculating that the actor is now available to take on the role of James Bond - should the casting director come calling.
Cavill, 39, also announced his departure from Netflix's The Witcher in late October. He will be replaced by Liam Hemsworth.
On Wednesday, Gunn wrote on Twitter: ""Peter and I have a DC slate ready to go, which we couldn't be more over-the-moon about; we'll be able to share some exciting information about our first projects at the beginning of the new year.
""Among those on the slate is Superman. In the initial stages, our story will be focusing on an earlier part of Superman's life, so the character will not be played by Henry Cavill.""
He added: ""But we just had a great meeting with Henry and we're big fans and we talked about a number of exciting possibilities to work together in the future."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63983600
business	Russia unveils 'tasty' McDonald's substitute	"Watch: The BBC's Steve Rosenberg had a taste of Russia's McDonald's replacement
It's a Russian revamp of an American icon. 
Fast food giant McDonald's pulled out of Russia in protest at the invasion of Ukraine and sold its restaurants here - more than 800 - to Russian businessman Alexander Govor. 
first rebranded restaurants are reopening in Moscow. 
re's a new name: ""Vkusno i Tochka"", which translates as ""Tasty and that's it"". 
Gone are the Golden Arches, replaced by a stylised letter M, made out of two French fries, and a dot (or, perhaps, a burger?)
Gone are the Big Mac and McFlurry. 
But the new owners hope customers won't notice too many differences. They held a press conference in the flagship restaurant on Pushkin Square, where the very first Moscow McDonald's opened 32 years ago. 
""Our goal is that our guests do not notice a difference either in quality or ambience,"" said Oleg Paroyev, CEO of Vkusno i Tochka.
utlet sported a slogan reading: ""The name changes, love stays.""
But one male protester disrupted the event, saying ""bring back Big Mac!""
w company says the burgers' composition has not changed and the McDonald's equipment remains. 
Back in 1990 I was in the massive queue: it took me three hours to get in and be served. I remember the excitement. The arrival of McDonald's was a symbol of Soviet Russia embracing Western ideas, Western culture, Western food. 
What's happening here today is a symbol, too: of how Russia and the West are moving apart. And the crowd was a lot smaller.
We're not just talking burgers. Many global brands and multinational companies have suspended business in Russia or sold up and pulled out completely, in protest at the Russian offensive in Ukraine. 
Mr Govor, a Siberian oil magnate, aims to reopen about a quarter of the 850 rebranded McDonald's restaurants by the end of the month. 
Last month McDonald's announced that it would leave Russia because of the ""humanitarian crisis"" and ""unpredictable operating environment"" caused by the war.
Russia and Ukraine accounted for about 9% of McDonald's global sales last year.
Starbucks, Coca Cola, Levi's and Apple are among the international brands that have left Russia or suspended sales here since the 24 February invasion of Ukraine. 
Russia is now under wide-ranging international sanctions, which are disrupting its supply chains and increasing unemployment."	/news/world-europe-61774475
sports	Mixed feelings on a 'breakthrough' year - Armagh star Rian O'Neill on The GAA Social	"Rian O'Neill won't soon forget his journey through the 2022 inter-county season with Armagh.
As he geared up for his fourth year in the senior set-up, he received a pleasant surprise: being asked by boss Kieran McGeeney to co-captain the team alongside Aidan Nugent. 
O'Neill was well aware of the significance, but any suspicions that the heightened responsibility would weigh heavily on his broad shoulders were emphatically dispelled by his virtuoso display in the Division One opener win over Dublin. 
Gracing Croke Park's hallowed turf for the first time, O'Neill scored 1-4 from full-forward as Armagh marked their top-flight return after a 10-year absence with a verve and swagger that forced many onlookers to sit up and take notice.
For O'Neill it set the tone for the next five months, and while he was ultimately forced to grapple with crushing disappointment, the Crossmaglen Rangers ace feels that 2022 was the year in which he really made his mark on the inter-county scene. 
""It felt to an extent that it was,"" O'Neill told The GAA Social when asked by Thomas Niblock if he considers 2022 his breakout season.  
""At the start of the year, Geezer came to me and Nugent and asked us to be captains of the team. When Geezer asks you to be captain of Armagh, it's something you really have to give your all to. 
""He'd obviously seen something in me. I wouldn't be the biggest of talkers but I prefer to do my talking on the field and prefer to lead that way.""
Unfortunately for O'Neill, the momentum and confidence built from an eye-catching Division One campaign would be shattered in the Ulster Championship cauldron when he was held scoreless in Armagh's 1-16 to 0-12 defeat by Donegal in Ballybofey.
""I felt fit all the way through the year - I was playing well but against Donegal I had an absolute nightmare, nothing went over for me,"" added O'Neill, who has returned from a summer in America to aid Crossmaglen's quest for a first Armagh SFC title since 2019.  
""I couldn't get on the ball, couldn't do anything, but against Tyrone and Donegal [in the All-Ireland qualifiers] again I started to kick on. [The All-Ireland quarter-final against] Galway, I had a good first half but was poor after that. 
""But it did feel like a bit of a breakthrough year for me. I was playing well in previous years, but this year I felt near on top of my game and that if I played well I'd be hard stopped.""
Being asked to lead his county, lighting up Croke Park, an All-Star nomination; O'Neill has a lot to savour when reflecting on 2022.
However, he maintains that any post-mortem on the inter-county campaign is tinged with regret given the manner of Armagh's All-Ireland exit, losing to Galway in a penalty shootout at the end of one of the most riveting championship games in recent memory.
In an incident-packed encounter that included the mass brawl which resulted in a six-month suspension for O'Neill's team-mate Tiernan Kelly for eye-gouging, O'Neill scored 0-4 and was the only Orchard player to score in the shootout.
His most memorable contribution, though, came in the dying embers of regulation time, nailing a 50m free to force extra-time after Armagh had roared their way back from a six-point deficit with two injury-time goals. 
In extra-time, Jemar Hall's score looked to have sealed a semi-final spot for Armagh before Cillian McDaid landed a beauty to set up the shootout. 
""You look back at Galway with regrets coming from that game, the way we lost the penalty shootout,"" admits O'Neill.  
""We didn't really perform in the second half. We had it won in extra-time, lost it again, got back into it. 
""There are regrets but we feel we've progressed through the year. We let ourselves down in the first game against Donegal but we came back against Tyrone and Donegal (in the qualifiers) and made a bit of a statement. 
""We were hoping to push on against Galway and get to that semi-final where we felt we'd have a chance coming up against Derry or Clare, it turned out to be Derry.
""Then you see how close Galway ran Kerry in the final and it just enters your head 'what if' we did get over the Galway game and the circumstances we did lose, it's a bitter pill to swallow but we've got to put that to the back of the head and go again next year."""	/sport/gaelic-games/62966290

Google has been told to be transparent about location tracking in the future and develop a web page telling people about the data it collects.
It is the largest privacy-related multi-state settlement in US history.

business	Australia to lift electricity market suspension as prices ease	"Australia's energy market operator says it will lift its suspension of the country's main wholesale electricity market as its power crisis eases.
restrictions will be temporarily lifted on Thursday before a final decision is made.
In an unprecedented move last week it suspended trading on the platform following a surge in prices.
Officials also urged people in the state of New South Wales to conserve power over concerns about shortages.
- which has a population of around 8 million - includes the country's biggest city Sydney.
In a statement on Wednesday, the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) said it had ""seen a clear improvement in market conditions"" and that it would resume trading from 04:00 in Sydney on Thursday (19:00 BST Wednesday).
It added that it would monitor the market for at least 24 hours before making a decision to formally lift the suspension.
""We have seen nearly 4,000 megawatts of generation return to service since this time last week, and that means the risk of any shortfall has reduced markedly,"" Aemo chief executive Daniel Westerman said in a televised media conference.
Australia is one of the world's biggest exporters of coal and liquefied natural gas but it has been struggling with a power crisis since last month.
ree quarters of its electricity is still generated using coal, and it has long been accused of not doing enough to cut its emissions by investing in renewables.
In recent weeks, the country has felt the impact of disruptions to coal supplies, outages at several coal-fired power plants and soaring global energy prices.
Meanwhile, the demand for energy has jumped amid a cold snap and as Australia's economy opens up after Covid-19 restrictions were eased.
All of this helped drive up electricity prices on the wholesale market to above the A$300 (£170; $208) per megawatt hour price cap set by Aemo.
However, that cap was below the cost of production for several generators, who decided to withhold capacity.
Last Wednesday, Aemo took the unprecedented step of suspending the market and said it would set prices directly and compensate generators for the shortfall.
It also asked consumers in New South Wales to ""temporarily reduce their energy usage"".
At the time Mr Westerman said Aemo had ""put the security of the grid, and keeping the lights on above everything else"".
""We asked generators to bid their plant back into the system - and that is happening more - giving us greater visibility of generation in real time,"" he added.

health	Rapid cancer diagnosis centres open in Northern Ireland	"wo specialist clinics aimed at reducing the time it takes for a cancer diagnosis have been opened by the Department of Health.
Rapid Diagnosis Centres are being launched at Whiteabbey Hospital in County Antrim and South Tyrone Hospital in Dungannon.
will treat patients with concerning symptoms which doctors suspect could be cancer.
GPs in Armagh, Dungannon and east Antrim can now refer patients.
res are the first of their kind in Northern Ireland and are a key part of the Department of Health's 10 year Cancer Strategy published in March.
rtment said patients referred to the centres will receive co-ordinated examination and investigations based on their needs in a one-stop environment with rapid reporting of results.
With the patient's consent the Rapid Diagnosis Centre clinician will make an onward referral to the appropriate speciality for patients who require further investigation or treatment.
Department of Health Permanent Secretary Peter May said: ""This is an important step forward in our ability to diagnosis those harder to identify cancers and is a key action set out in the Department's Cancer Strategy.
""Most importantly, there is the opportunity to diagnose more people sooner and to improve both patient experiences and outcomes."" 
Heather Monteverde, Department of Health professional advisor, said the centres will offer GPs access to a fast-track clinic for people who present with vague symptoms which a GP suspects could be cancer. 
""They will not only provide a better diagnostic service for patients and GPs, but will also be more efficient,"" she added.
Kevin McMahon, director of surgical and clinical services in the Northern Health and Social Care Trust, welcomed the opening of the centres.

health	NHS trust apologises as man kept in hospital for more than a year	"A man with physical and mental health problems is ""living"" in a hospital despite being fit to leave, a court has heard.
man, who is in his 30s, has been in hospital for more than a year.
A barrister leading the man's legal team told how he had tried to ""escape"" and broke an arm during the attempt.
Court of Protection heard that he remained in hospital because no ""available alternative accommodation"" had been found. 
Manchester City Council has responsibility for his care, but the NHS trust involved has apologised for ""not yet"" identifying a ""suitable community placement"".
A lawyer representing another health authority told the judge that professionals involved were under pressure because of the ""state"" of the health and social care services.
Mr Justice Hayden, who is overseeing the case, asked why no plan for the man's discharge had been formulated and indicated that he would review the case in the near future.
""This is a case about a young man who has been in [hospital] for over a year,"" barrister Ben McCormack, who is leading the man's legal team, said in a written case outline.
""He is medically fit to be discharged.""
Mr McCormack said the man was ""living"" in hospital and added: ""The real problem is that no available alternative accommodation has yet been sourced.""
He said despite the ""wide range"" of public authorities involved, each of which supported discharge, the man remained in hospital without any ""alternative options actually yet on the table"".
""[He] dislikes being required to live in hospital,"" Mr McCormack told the judge.
""He feels imprisoned. He has tried to escape through the ceiling of the bathroom attached to his ward.
""He hurt himself, he broke his arm.""
Mr McCormack said the man had ""extensive health needs"" which would need to be met outside hospital.
But he added: ""We are not attempting to land a person on the Moon here.""
Mr McCormack said the man had a computer, and a television, and had watched the World Cup Final on Sunday.
""We will deploy any and every resource to try and get this man out of hospital,"" Vikram Sachdeva KC, who represented one of the health authorities involved, told the judge.
""We know the state that the health service and social care services are in.
""It is cold comfort to the individual, but the professionals do have that pressure.""
Barrister Alexis Hearnden, who represented the NHS trust involved, told the judge in a written case outline: ""The trust offers an apology to the court and [the man] that it has not yet identified a suitable community placement.""
She said ""progress"" had been made recently.
""[His] physical health has at times been extremely precarious,"" she said.
""During the currency of this hospital admission, his health has also fluctuated and a stroke in July 2022 set back plans to discharge [him] from hospital.""

business	Cost of living: Inflation hits NI consumer confidence	"Consumer confidence in Northern Ireland fell sharply in the first quarter of 2022 as inflation hit household finances, a Danske Bank survey has suggested.
urvey was carried out in the second half of March with 1,003 people.
More than 40% of people expected their financial position to worsen over the next year. 
Only 18% believe their finances will be in a better position in 12 months.
In comparison a survey conducted in the final quarter of 2021 found at that time only 26% of people expected their financial position to deteriorate in the year ahead.
In terms of spending, 38% of respondents said they expected to spend less on expensive items over the next year, compared with 26% who anticipated spending more.
However, there is a broad expectation that the jobs market recovery will be sustained.
When asked about job security, 13% of people expected to become more secure in their jobs, while 61% expected no change in job security and only 8% thought their job security would worsen.
Danske Bank chief economist Conor Lambe said: ""In Northern Ireland and the wider UK, consumer spending accounts for a considerable proportion of economic activity and is therefore an important driver of economic growth.
""Inflation has already increased sharply and is likely to rise even higher in the months ahead, exerting a further squeeze on consumer spending.""
UK main rate of inflation, the Consumer Price Index, stood at 7% in March but is expected to rise higher when the April statistics are released this week.
Last week, two of Northern Ireland's biggest food companies warned consumers to expect further price rises this year.
Food production inputs like fuel, fertiliser and animal feed have experienced rapid inflation over the last year.
Dale Farm chief executive Nick Whelan said only about half of that inflation had been passed to consumers.
was echoed by Justin Coleman, director at Moy Park, which is one of Europe's biggest chicken producers.
""I don't think the full force of food inflation has hit retail shelves yet,"" he said. "	/news/uk-northern-ireland-61468186
health	Christmas: The theatre group bringing joy to care homes	"A theatre company has been bringing festive cheer to care homes across Northern Ireland with a series of performances specially created for people living with dementia.
Commedia of Errors' nostalgia-filled Christmas shows feature classic songs and poetry.
For many care homes, it has marked the return to face-to-face performances after the Covid-19 pandemic.
""It is such a joy to be part of,"" said theatre-maker Benjamin Gould.
uring variety show, called Plays Aloud, has been visiting people in care homes and dementia care units across Northern Ireland.
Directed by Clare McMahon and Benjamin Gould, the shows have been funded by Arts Council Northern Ireland and Halifax Foundation NI.
""We have developed over the years a more specialised style of performance,"" said Mr Gould.
""It focuses on engagement so a lot of it is to do with encouraging the audience to sing and recite poetry with us. 
""It's not just about standing there performing. It's about sharing the experience with the residents and it has a little bit more of a communal feel to it.""
Mr Gould said he can see the mood of residents ""changing dramatically"" during performances.
""If you go in and somebody's having a bad day, they are not really happy and engaging but you hit on the right song and suddenly you see them light up and they'll start singing along and they'll start dancing and that positive mood will carry on maybe even days after we've left,"" he said.
""Because memory can be so intrinsically linked to music and poetry you could have somebody who is not verbal before you come in and if you hit on the right song or the right piece of poetry, they'll start reciting along with you, start singing along with you and they'll actually be able to hold a conversation with you as well.
""It's a lonely place if you're not able to engage and if you get to do that then it becomes much more positive for them.""
Christmas tour features four performers working in groups of two to ensure the group can pay a visit to a care home in every county of Northern Ireland.
""It's beautiful sometimes,"" said performer Rosie McClelland.
""There was a time when a lady, who hadn't really spoken for a while, started to recite every single word of a poem because she had learnt it at primary school.
""It's wonderful how those core memories still exist and that's why we want to bring the core memories and give them that nostalgia feeling.""
Performer Adam Dougal said it was a privilege to be part of the show.
""I think music is a very powerful thing and it can evoke memories - we all associate a certain song with a time in our life,"" he said.
""It can be very moving. What we're trying to do is have a connection with that audience because we're in a very intimate environment.
""It can be very emotional and it can be very uplifting as well.
""Sometimes family members are there and for them to witness their relative, their mum or dad, enjoying themselves, coming out of their shells, can be a really special thing and quite moving.""
Fiona McAnespie, from Radius Housing, said she has seen a positive impact on residents, and their families.
""Some of our residents would be limited in communication due to their dementia but they'll be citing poetry or singing along,"" she said.
""I have seen relatives in tears because they maybe haven't heard their mum or dad speak or react for a long time."" 
She said people living with dementia can often retain long-term memories, which is why the old songs and poetry used in the performances can have such an impact.
""We obviously can see that it brings back a memory to them and for some it may be something that was played on their wedding day or something they recited at school,"" she said.
""The reaction is really quite phenomenal when you see it."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-64024395
politics	What's happening in Parliament next week?	"It's going to be a pretty weird week in Parliament. There's some significant law-making - on stamp duty and EU Law - but it will be completely overshadowed by the battle for the Conservative leadership. 
w PM could be anointed as early as Monday afternoon, or as late as Friday, if an online ballot of Tory members is required.
Question times and select committee interrogations will feature ministers who may not be in office a week later, or who may be auditioning for a promotion.
w prime minister will have allies to reward, opponents to de-fang, enemies to punish and big beasts to bring in, so expect significant ministerial changes.
And how much point is there in asking about policy? 
re's a big financial statement due on 31 October - the Monday after the new PM is due to emerge.
But will the new PM want the proposals now being drawn up, or even the chancellor doing the drawing-up? Or will the threat of a market backlash ensure that the new PM accepts whatever decisions Jeremy Hunt has made? 
Meanwhile, Mr Hunt's arrival in the Treasury has created a vacancy for chair of the Health and Social Care Committee. 
His successor must be a Conservative MP and possible contenders include former health ministers, Steve Brine, Stephen Hammond and James Morris, plus Victoria Atkins, a former Justice Minister, and GP Dr Luke Evans. The election is on 2 November.

sports	Winter Paralympics: How did the Great Britain team fare in Beijing?	"Great Britain have ended the Beijing Winter Paralympics with six medals - a gold, a silver and three bronzes from the alpine skiers and a snowboarding bronze.
It was was one short of the haul from Pyeongchang four years and came from the biggest GB team at a Winter Paralympics since 1994 in Lillehammer.
However, it did see them reach the UK Sport medal range of five to nine and they also secured some top-six finishes to strengthen their reputation.
Check out the information below to see how each member of the 24-strong British team fared in China.
Britain's most successful winter sport continued its run of success with all five medals coming from the visually impaired skiers. Brothers Neil and Andrew Simpson won the first Paralympic or Olympic gold on snow for GB men with success in the super-G and also claimed a super-combined bronze. Menna Fitzpatrick added to her gold, two silvers and a bronze from Pyeongchang with another silver and bronze - this time with guide Gary Smith. And after two silvers and a bronze four years ago, Millie Knight and Brett Wild added another bronze in the downhill.
Para-ice hockey has been part of the Games programme since 1994 in Lillehammer, but Great Britain have never won a medal and last competed in the sport at the 2006 Games in Turin, finishing seventh. That team included Richard Whitehead who went on to win Paralympic gold in athletics at 2012 and 2016.
No GB team in Beijing
Including both cross-country skiing and biathlon, it has been part of the Paralympic programme since the first Games. GB have two bronze medals through seven-time Paralympian Peter Young in the 10k B1 event in 1984 and then 10 years later in the 5km classical technique. Scott Meenagh, in his second Games, had GB's best finish in Beijing with sixth in the biathlon individual event.
Made its debut in Sochi in 2014 with men's and women's snowboard cross events while banked slalom events were introduced four years later. Ollie Hill won GB's first medal with bronze in the banked slalom in Beijing.
Wheelchair curling made its first Paralympic appearance in 2006 when GB won silver, losing in the final to Canada. There was also a dramatic bronze in Sochi in 2014. But they missed out on the play-offs in Beijing for the second Games in a row, finishing eighth, one place lower than in Pyeongchang."	/sport/disability-sport/60017260
business	House prices drop for the first time this year, says Rightmove	"Asking prices for homes have dropped for the first time this year, down £4,795, because of a summer lull in activity, says sales portal Rightmove.
Although interest rates are rising - which would increase the cost of a mortgage - it said seasonal factors were key to the drop in prices.
king price fell by 1.3% between July and August to £365,173.
wo years had been ""frenzied"" in the UK housing market, said Rightmove.
Prices soared as the pandemic prompted many people to search for more space in which to live and work.
How big an impact the rising cost of living, and consistent increases in interest rates, will have on the housing market will be watched closely.
m Bannister, Rightmove's director of property science, said: ""A drop in asking prices is to be expected this month, as the market returns towards normal seasonal patterns after a frenzied two years, and many would-be home movers become distracted by the summer holidays.""
1.3% drop in August was in line with the average drop seen that month over the past 10 years, Rightmove said.
""We are still expecting price changes for the rest of the year to continue to follow the usual seasonal pattern, which means we'll end year at around 7% annual growth, even with the wider economic uncertainty,"" Mr Bannister added.
He said that data showed the rising interest rates were yet to have a significant impact on the number of people wanting to move home.
""For those looking to move who are concerned about interest rate rises, it's important that they get a mortgage in principle early on in their moving journey to understand what they could afford to borrow, and find out about the rates available to them to assess what they are able to repay each month,"" he said.
rage five-year fixed rate mortgage has now breached 4%, according to Moneyfacts.co.uk, but experts expect rates to climb further.
ggest risk to making mortgage repayments is usually the loss of a job, but anyone in that position should get help, at least in the short-term, from their lender. 
Debt advisors say anyone in financial trouble should talk to their mortgage provider as soon as possible."	/news/business-62549477

Gloucester Dementia Choir was launched on Saturday with a special Christmas session offering a safe environment for socialising, singing and celebrating music.
Jacqueline Fitall has dementia and said the first session was ""lovely"".
""I do forget things sometimes- but I absolutely love singing,"" she said.
""There are some really nice people here, and I have really enjoyed myself- it has been a nice experience,"" she added.
r was set up by the Gloucestershire Academy of Music which said it was building on the work it already performs in care homes across the county.
Jenny Harrison and Becky Chevis, from Gloucestershire, said they decided to launch the choir after they found a gap in music resources for those with dementia.
""Music evokes a lot of emotions, and it allows those living with the condition to reminisce,"" said Ms Harrison.
""When you play a song that they used to listen to forty years ago, they come to life, remember those words and find their voices to sing those words.
""Music is a really powerful tool for people with dementia and we want to utilise that.""
r is not only encouraging individuals with dementia to get involved, but also their families and carers too.
From 13 January the choir will begin offering sessions every two weeks.
Ms Chevis said she found the first session ""moving"".
""There was someone who sang a solo on the spot today - it nearly made me cry,"" she said.
""There is some amazing research about music and dementia- we know it can help ease depression and anxiety amongst those living with the condition.
""The first session has really proven that music can make people happy and provided that lovely feeling of being together with each other.

sports	Bellator 289: Raufeon Stots beats Danny Sabatello to retain title	"Raufeon Stots edged bitter rival Danny Sabatello by split decision to retain the interim bantamweight title at Bellator 289 in Connecticut.
Stots, 33, was controlled by fellow American Sabatello, 29, for periods but out-struck him to reach the final of the Bantamweight World Grand Prix.
He will face Patchy Mix after the American submitted Magomed Magomedov earlier in the night.
winner will likely fight Sergio Pettis for the undisputed title.
's champion Pettis was forced to pull out of the tournament with injury in March.
rim title bout between Stots and Juan Archuleta in the quarter-finals, which Stots won to set up the encounter with Sabatello.
Months of venomous verbal exchanges have passed between Stots and Sabatello since the fight was confirmed in June.
While promoting the fight in August, the pair had to be separated live on air during journalist Ariel Helwani's MMA Hour show.
Sabatello was largely booed on his walk to the cage, with Stots receiving the more positive ovation from the crowd inside the Mohegan Sun Arena.
In the first round, Sabatello landed a takedown, revealing the wrestling-heavy game-plan pundits predicted he would look to enforce on Stots.
fight progressed with Stots excelling in the striking and Sabatello countering by looking to take Stots down.
On the handful of times Sabatello's takedowns were successful, he held position while not inflicting much damage, which is perhaps what swayed the fight in Stots' favour when the judges were scoring.
By the final round Sabatello's nose was bloodied while Stots showed little sign of damage, illustrating the difference in output between the pair.
Both fighters raised their arms and circled the cage when the final bell rung, believing they had done enough for victory, but it was Stots who had his arm raised by the referee, leading to a swift exit for Sabatello.
""He didn't do no damage, I was walking him down the whole time, I got his face bloodied and I'm going to the final,"" said Stots in the post-fight interview.
""I was thinking separation and damage. He was trying to control me but hugging doesn't win fights.""
Victory extends the unbeaten start to Stots' Bellator career to seven, with Sabatello suffering the first defeat of his four fights in the promotion.
Stots was joined in the cage by fellow finalist Mix after the post-fight interview, with the pair engaging in a friendly stare-down. 
In the co-main event, American Liz Carmouche retained her flyweight title, winning a rematch with Juliana Velasquez in the second round via an armbar submission.
Carmouche, 38, executed her grappling-heavy game-plan to perfection as she successfully took Brazil's Velasquez down, transitioned to full mount and applied the fight-ending manoeuvre.
r first fight in April ended in controversial circumstances, with many pundits believing the referee stepped in to halt Carmouche's grounded attack on Velasquez too early.
However, there were no doubts over the manor of victory this time, as Carmouche made the first defence of her championship.
In victory, Carmouche extended her unbeaten streak in Bellator to five wins and inflicted the second defeat of Velasquez's 14-fight career.
Former UFC and Strikeforce title challenger Carmouche has now won 18 of the 25 fights in her 12-year career.

politics	Earl of Shrewsbury faces suspension from Lords over lobbying claims	"A hereditary peer is facing suspension from the House of Lords for breaking lobbying rules. 
Earl of Shrewsbury was found by the Lords Conduct Committee to have approached ministers on behalf of a company marketing Covid-19 sanitiser products, which he worked for. 
mmittee recommended he should be suspended for nine months, which is subject to a vote by the upper house.
Lord Shrewsbury has said he did not realise his actions broke the rules.
Earl of Shrewsbury is one of the few remaining hereditary peers in the Lords and was affiliated with the Conservatives until October but now sits as a non-party crossbench peer.
He was paid £57,000 by healthcare company SpectrumX for his work as a consultant over a period of 19 months between 2020 and 2022. 
In 2020, at the height of the Covid pandemic, the firm was seeking regulatory approval for products including hand sanitisers and a walk-in disinfectant tunnel.
r approached ministers, including then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock to promote the company's tunnel in return for a £3,000 monthly retainer, the committee's report found. 
He referred himself to the commissioner following allegations about his conduct in relation to the company in the Sunday Times. 
Lord Shrewsbury has argued his work for SpectrumX was ""openly commercial dealing"", that he declared his interest as an adviser to the company and never sought to ""influence policy"". 
mmittee accepted that he did not act with ""deliberate dishonesty"" and did not realise his actions broke the rules. 
However, it found ""clear"" breaches of the Lords' code of conduct by seeking ""to profit from membership of the House"" and providing parliamentary advice or exercising parliamentary influence in return for payment. 
Separately, Baroness Goudie was also found to have breached the code ""by agreeing to provide parliamentary advice in return for payment"" and for breaking rules on the use of the House's facilities. 
mmittee has recommended she is suspended from the Lords for six months and Labour has also suspended her from the parliamentary party. 
reaches relate to her work for ecoLegacy in 2016 and 2017.
She was paid €20,000 (£17,454) over a 10-month period as an adviser for the company. the Lords committee said in its report. 
As part of her role, she advised the company on who to approach about their work and offered to book a room on the estate to hold meetings, although ultimately no room was reserved and Baroness Goudie did not directly approach parliamentarians on the company's behalf. 
She also commissioned research by the Lords Library on behalf of the company, in breach of the code. 
r has acknowledged she had an interest in the company during the period and has apologised for failing to register that interest until April 2017. 
However, the committee said she refused to accept her conduct had breached any other aspect of the code. 
In response to the report, Baroness Goudie said: ""Six-and-a-half years after the alleged events, I was accused by a former colleague of 'paid advocacy' and a late declaration of my interests.
""I totally refute the first allegation on which the commissioner made no finding and sincerely apologise for my late declaration in 2016, before which time I had used the Lords Library on one occasion to check facts relevant to my interests.""
upper chamber is due to vote on whether to approve the recommendations next month. "	/news/uk-politics-63998059

But she said ""difficult decisions would have to be made"" because the Scottish government's budgets had already been fully marked out.
Ms Somerville said: ""We've made it very clear to teachers, and everyone across the public sector, that we have huge sympathy for public sector workers, with high inflation and the cost of living that we have. 
""But we do also have to bear in mind the reality and the context. The Scottish government has a fixed budget. It cannot change taxes in the year. Its reserves have been fully utilised.
""If we're looking to fund public sector pay offers, that money has to come from somewhere else in the budget.
""There is no separate pot of money in the education budget or anywhere else within the Scottish budget to allow these deals to be made.""
Ministers have repeatedly said there is no more money for public sector pay deals - that their budget is already spent. 
Yet it is clear they intend to find more cash to make an improved offer to teachers to try to avert a national strike. 
rs to mean trimming cash already allocated for other things within the education budget and diverting it to salaries. 
While the EIS is seeking a 10% rise - double the 5% currently on offer - they are unlikely to get that when a separate dispute with local government workers was settled at around 7%. 
Scottish government does not seem to be proposing a similar approach in health. 
Why? Partly because they have already raided NHS budgets to improve the nurses' pay offer and worry that switching more cash could put patient health at greater risk. 
re also hoping the UK government will come up with some more cash to help resolve this dispute, with the first minister arguing that without it the NHS across the UK is close to breaking point. 
Deputy First Minister John Swinney announced £615m of spending cuts in his emergency budget review earlier this month.
It came on top of £560m cuts to public services in September.
Ms Somerville said she was still hopeful a deal could be done with teachers before the first walkout at the end of this month.
She said: ""When we met the trade unions yesterday, along with Cosla the employers, there was a clear understanding that no-one wanted to get to the stage where there was industrial action.
""We all appreciate the huge disruption that children and young people have faced over the past few years.
""And that's why, as a Scottish government, we are absolutely determined to see... if there is additional funding that we can provide to Cosla to allow an enhanced pay offer.""
Scottish Conservatives called on the education secretary to ""show some leadership"" and give education and skills ""the priority it needs"".
rty's education spokesman Stephen Kerr told Good Morning Scotland: ""The Scottish government have had the largest block grant in history.
""The is about political priority and the top priority should be education.
""The Scottish government need to show some flexibility and creativity and solve this dispute.
""We have seen in the past they've been able to find the money when they needed to find the money.""
EIS general secretary Andrea Bradley said Ms Somerville's comments that the Scottish government was determined to make a new offer were ""somewhat positive"".
She added: ""There has been very little movement since around the third week in September.
""So it is good to hear that the Scottish government is prepared to look again to see how it might be able to provide additional funds in order that Cosla can make a better offer than that 5%, which falls far short of inflation and would amount to an almost 8% real terms pay cut for teachers."""	/news/uk-scotland-63596443
