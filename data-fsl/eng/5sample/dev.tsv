entertainment	Edinburgh Fringe: The viral comedy stars leaping from TikTok to the stage	"A number of new comedians amassed huge followings on TikTok during the pandemic. Now some are trying to convert viral fame into on-stage success by performing live at the Edinburgh Fringe.
kTok has emerged as a major force in comedy, by letting anyone share short, funny videos. The company is even sponsoring Edinburgh's annual comedy festival and hosting a virtual stage this year.
While social media isn't likely to replace stand-up, it has allowed a new generation of budding comedy stars to bypass the traditional routes to make their names.
But can the online sensations cut it in front of a live audience? Here, four of the biggest TikTok comedy acts who are performing at Edinburgh this month talk about becoming viral stars, taking to the stage - and whether the two can exist together.
In the olden days (ie a few years ago), a comedian at Edinburgh would hope to be spotted by an agent or TV producer who might one day be able to help them build a global fanbase. In the age of TikTok, performers like Christian Brighty can do it themselves in a few months.
""I'm going to tour America next year - which is an obscene, ridiculous idea,"" says Brighty, 28, from Cambridgeshire. ""I'm an alternative comic who, in 2019, was doing shows in dingy pub basements where I think Covid began. And I now have enough people to go and take my show to America. That's insane.""
Just under half of his 430,000 TikTok followers are in the US, and it's easy to imagine his riotous and knowing parodies of lusty period dramas going down well in the post-Bridgerton era. He joined the platform while furloughed during lockdown, posting a video a day for a month.
""It was a safe enclosed space to be creative, to experiment, to fail,"" he says. ""There are no repercussions for posting a bad video because no-one will see it. But if you post a good one, then millions of people might see it. I learned so much in that time.""
His first video to break the million mark was inspired by watching Poldark with his girlfriend's family. He has gone on to establish regular, silly characters - a romantic poet, a highwayman with a hobbyhorse, and a running story that sends up the allure of the archetypal aloof hero.
Forcing himself to make lots of TikToks honed his joke writing and quality control, he says. ""And it's made me become a better live performer, without a doubt.""
His Edinburgh show Playboy, co-written with Amy Greaves, centres on another alter-ego, Lord Christian Brighty, a cross between Mr Darcy from Pride and Prejudice and Blackadder's Lord Flashheart.
""You can't just take what you do on TikTok and put it in front of an audience live. It won't work,"" he says. 
""I describe them as siblings because they require different sensibilities. There's stuff in the [live] show that's far too slow for TikTok, because on TikTok you need a joke immediately, it needs a strong visual, and the idea needs to be at the header. Whereas you can't really do that on stage.""
ge show is more fully-formed and is ""the more authentic version of me"", he says. It was praised by The Telegraph, which said: ""An amusing 10-second video doesn't always translate to a good hour in the theatre, but in this case it indisputably has.""
Abi Clarke was ""very new"" to stand-up after spending a year doing low-key shows on the circuit before the pandemic hit. By the time the lockdowns finally ended, she emerged with hundreds of thousands of online fans. She now has 840,000 followers on TikTok and 360,000 on Instagram.
""Before, I was able to be anonymous and if a gig went bad, I'd just disappear and think, no-one's going to remember anyway,"" she says. ""Whereas now, there's more pressure there. Quite often people in the audience do know who you are or have come specifically for you.""
Some have even turned up wearing her merch. But on stage, Clarke is still taking things slowly.
She's not doing the standard solo hour-long show at Edinburgh, instead being one of four new comics on the bill at the Pleasance venue's prestigious Comedy Reserve night. ""I'm still in training,"" she says.
""If you see someone with a large social media following, a lot of people think you're the same as the comedians they see on telly. They're like, 'Well, you're a famous comedian'. But no, any comedian you see on TV has probably been going at least six years. And I've been going since 2019, with a two-year pandemic in the middle with no live performing.""
She found success online with shrewdly-observed, shareable sketches like If Cats Were Human and If Dogs Were Human, and skits about office gossips Jill and Tracey, and life inside Asos HQ. With their quick edits, multiple characters and maximum running times of a minute, they are very different from her stand-up routine.
""They really don't bleed into each other a lot to be honest. I'd say only twice I've written [live] material and written a sketch about the same thing.""
Her live routine is also ""a lot ruder"", she says. ""You get to be a bit naughtier on stage, whereas I think on the internet things can get taken out of context or people who speak different languages don't understand you're joking. So I think you've got to be very wholesome online. You've got to be your chirpy self.
""But on stage I get to show all sides of me, which is really fun because you work to get them [the audience] to like you at the start and then you can see how far you can go without losing them.""
When Irish comedian Lee Brophy started posting parodies as a lip-syncing, LGBT-accepting Catholic priest who ""puts the bi in Bible"", he attracted more than 700,000 followers on TikTok - and reactions ranging from death threats to cries for help from queer teens in strict religious families.
Brophy's Edinburgh stand-up show, titled False Prophet, is about the double-edged impact of becoming known as the TikTok priest - and he will effectively kill off the character at the end of the festival.
""It's been a weird journey,"" says Brophy, who was also on the stand-up circuit before the pandemic. ""I wasn't prepared for any of this. I was just making silly jokes on the internet and trying to get a little bit of feedback from people. And I got a lot of feedback from people.""
His broad-minded, fun-loving priest was originally in a TV pilot that Brophy wrote at the start of lockdown. The comedian decided to test the script by posting clips on TikTok.
""The priest was a very minor character to begin with,"" he explains. ""Then I put him up online and he had this progressive point of view that people resonated with, and I was like, oh, there's an appetite for this.
""So I thought, I'll just do that. It became a scenario of me waking up every single morning, putting on what was to me a costume, and sitting in front of my phone by nine o'clock lip-synching to Taylor Swift.""
Some didn't get the joke, though. ""There are the people who believe I'm a priest and love it. And then there are the people who absolutely detest it, who are like, 'You are leading people to hell'.""
His task now, he says, is to ""not necessarily erase that part because I'm grateful for all the things that have come out of it - but to [show] I am not that person, give myself the freedom to be a performer again, and to be recognised as a performer and comedian and an artist"".
In a five-star review, Edinburgh Guide said it was ""so clear that this is just the stepping stone into something so much greater"".
So, after his Edinburgh run, he will post a video putting Father Lee out to pasture. ""I've been playing along with this because it's been funny to me, but I kind of want my life back now,"" he says.
Before the pandemic, sisters Chloe and Tabby Tingey had given up on being performers. Chloe, who trained at Berklee College of Music in Boston, was working in digital marketing. Tabby, who went to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, had retrained to teach yoga.
Covid hit, the yoga studio never opened, and the pair moved in together. They dipped their toes into TikTok with weightlifting challenges, strangely. Then, having both been recently dumped, they decided to post a comic song about relationships.
""We thought no-one would see it because nobody followed us at that point,"" says Tabby, 28. They were wrong, and tens of thousands did see it.
Chloe, 30, continues: ""We thought, oh, this is the most views we've ever had in our whole lives, so maybe we should just ride this wave. But it was a huge shock and surprise.""
r videos became more elaborate, and soon attracted millions of views. ""To this day, we're still shocked every day when we wake up that we're musical comedians,"" Chloe adds. ""This is very unexpected.""
As well as parodies about dating and men, they do hugely popular spoofs of a party-loving Boris Johnson. They usually rewrite the lyrics of pop hits, and now have 400,000 followers.
r live show Bittersweet, on the other hand, is all made up of their own frank and funny songs, which mostly take aim at manipulative, inadequate and infuriating men - ""every second-rate Romeo we've ever known"", as one tune puts it.
A couple of songs have appeared both online and on stage, but mostly there's not much crossover. Writing an hour-long stage show was ""very different than having these isolated little ideas"", Tabby says. 
Chloe explains: ""It's small little bits on TikTok, and for the live show we've had to really think about the arc of it, and how it all fits together.""
It is ""difficult to gauge"" how many people in the Edinburgh audience are there because of TikTok, Tabby says.
Her sister adds: ""Somebody came to our show who had come all the way from Illinois to see us because she's a TikTok fan of ours. That made us really feel an immense gratitude.""
Edinburgh Fringe runs until 29 August."	/news/entertainment-arts-62573535
business	China Covid: Angry protests at giant iPhone factory in Zhengzhou	"WATCH: Chinese protesters clash with riot police at giant iPhone factory
Protests have erupted at the world's biggest iPhone factory in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, according to footage circulated widely online.
Videos show hundreds of workers marching, with some confronted by people in hazmat suits and riot police.
reaming the protests said workers were beaten by police. Videos also showed clashes.
Manufacturer Foxconn said it would work with staff and local government to prevent further violence.
In its statement, the firm said some workers had doubts about pay but that the firm would fulfil pay based on contracts.
It also described as ""patently untrue"" rumours that new recruits were being asked to share dormitories with workers who were Covid-positive.
Dormitories were disinfected and checked by local officials before new people moved in, Foxconn said.
Last month, rising Covid cases saw the site locked down, prompting some workers to break out and go home. The company then recruited new workers with the promise of generous bonuses.
Footage shared on a livestreaming site showed workers shouting: ""Defend our rights! Defend our rights!"" 
Other workers were seen smashing surveillance cameras and windows with sticks.
""They changed the contract so that we could not get the subsidy as they had promised. They quarantine us but don't provide food,"" said one Foxconn worker during his live stream. 
""If they do not address our needs, we will keep fighting.""
He also claimed to have seen a man ""severely injured"" after a beating from police.
One employee who recently started working at the Zhengzhou plant also told the BBC workers were protesting because Foxconn had ""changed the contract they promised"".
He said some newly recruited workers feared getting Covid from staff who had been there during the earlier outbreak. 
""Those workers who are protesting are wanting to get a subsidy and return home,"" the staff member said.
re was a heavy police deployment to the plant on Wednesday morning, he said. Other livestreamed videos also showed crowds of armed police at the site.
Another newly recruited employee told the BBC he visited the protest scene on Wednesday where he saw ""one man with blood over his head lying on the ground"".
""I didn't know the exact reason why people are protesting but they are mixing us new workers with old workers who were [Covid] positive,"" he told the BBC.
Foxconn, a Taiwanese firm, is Apple's main subcontractor and its Zhengzhou plant assembles more iPhones than anywhere else in the world.
In late October many workers fled the plant amid rising Covid cases and allegations of poor treatment of staff. 
r escape was captured on social media as they rode lorries back to their hometowns elsewhere in the central Chinese province.
firm has since enacted so-called closed loop operations at the plant - keeping it isolated from the wider city of Zhengzhou because of a Covid outbreak there.
Earlier this month Apple said it expected lower shipments of iPhone 14 models because of the disruption to production in Zhengzhou."	/news/world-asia-china-63725812
technology	Byjus, Meta, Twitter: India tech workers fight back amid mass layoffs	"usands of young Indians are suddenly staring at an uncertain future as technology companies and start-ups announce mass layoffs due to global headwinds and funding crunches. But many are refusing to stay quiet about it.
In October, when Ravi (name changed on request) realised that he and several colleagues were likely to lose their jobs with a major Indian edtech firm, he immediately set up a  private messaging group with them.
group soon became a ""safe space"" for Ravi and his teammates to air their fears, share tips on dealing with the management and discuss labour laws and workers' rights. 
""It helped many in the team negotiate better exit policies with the company,"" Ravi says.
few months have been difficult for Indian workers in private companies - especially in the tech sector. Edtech firms Byju's and Unacademy have cut hundreds of jobs; social media giant Twitter has laid off more than half of its staff in India and Indians are among those affected after Meta - Facebook's parent company - shaved off about 13% of its 87,000-strong workforce.
f layoffs has sparked outrage on social media and many of those affected are turning to the internet -  like their counterparts in other countries - to air their dissatisfaction and form support networks. 
're tweeting about unceremonious firings, asking for jobs on LinkedIn, and using messaging platforms such as WhatsApp and Slack to rally colleagues, assert their rights and share information with journalists.
rtly because the culture of shame and silence that once existed around redundancies in India is gradually wearing thin as mass layoffs become more common. 
Pritha Dutt, a management and development sector professional, says that even a couple of decades ago, terminations were most likely chalked up to ""a performance issue"".
""Today, layoffs and downsizing have become accepted business practices, so terminations are no longer a taboo topic,"" she says.
And while the jury is still out on how effective social media is as a tool for redressal, experts say that it is helping unite and amplify voices, especially as trade unions are no longer as powerful as they used to be. 
While millions of Indian workers still belong to trade unions, the movement as a whole has been weakening for years. A number of factors - including burgeoning private sector jobs, new labour reforms and a rise in contractual work - have played a role in denting their membership and might.
""Along with employers making themselves more accessible, social media too is giving employees a platform to air their grievances, thereby reducing the need for a mediator - a role traditionally played by unions,"" says Professor Chandrasekhar Sripada at the Indian School of Business.
After Byju's announced in October that it would ""rationalise"" about 2,500 employees to ""achieve profitability"", many of its employees have been speaking to the media - often anonymously - about the company culture and the pressures they face. 
Sacked Twitter employees have taken to social media to vent their frustrations. ""Always a Tweep never a Twit,"" tweeted one former employee in a veiled reference to new owner Elon Musk's Twitter bio at the time. ""Got fired without even a confirmation email. There's always a new low,"" said another.
With the job market expanding, Ms Dutt says employees have become more confident about the marketability of their skills and don't mind standing up for their rights, even if that means burning bridges by calling out a person or organisation on social media.
And this public outrage can sometimes help, like pushing employers to apologise for firing staff in an insensitive manner or for promoting a toxic work culture. 
But Ms Dutt cautions that this success could be limited and short-lived. The option may also not be available to everyone - many still fear speaking out as they worry it might jeopardise future job prospects, or invoke legal action from their employer.
's why many employees are also looking for other ways to air their grievances and fight for their rights. 
In the southern city of Thiruvananthapuram, 140 Byju's employees who alleged they were being forced to resign went on a protest and also met a Kerala state minister, who announced an investigation into the matter - the state is governed by a coalition of Left parties, which advocates for workers' rights.
Days later, Byju's said it had reversed its decision to shut down operations at Thiruvananthapuram.
ree former employees at an edtech firm told the BBC on condition of anonymity that they were working with a trade union to negotiate severance and notice periods with the company. 
Suman Dasmahapatra, president of the Bangalore chapter of the All India IT & ITeS Employees' Union - a registered trade union that has been assisting hundreds of tech employees with labour disputes since 2018 - said that the organisation's membership has been steadily growing. 
He concedes that this is still tiny compared with the total number of employees - a majority of IT sector professionals, he says, are still uncomfortable being part of trade unions, either because they fear reprisal from the management, or because ""they don't see themselves as 'workers'"".
But Mr Dasmahapatra says he is confident that India will see a resurgence in unionisation as the push and pull of global economic forces make the job market more volatile.
Over the past couple of years, US giants such as Amazon, Starbucks and Apple have seen their workers form unions and observers say calls for unionisation are likely to grow louder, and spread across industries. 
Prof Sripada, however, disagrees. He says that the proliferation and strengthening of trade unions need not become the norm, as workplaces have already become more conscious about adopting progressive, people-centric policies. 
""Unions are a product of bad people management. When employers fail, unions rise. Employers today have the benefit of hindsight so the responsibility lies with them to make people management the centre of business,"" he says.
""But if organisations continue laying off people in an insensitive and callous manner - as we're seeing happen frequently - the story might be different."""	/news/world-asia-india-63619920
technology	Drone operators warned about flying near airports	"Police and airport authorities are warning of the ""potentially catastrophic"" consequences of drones being flown near airports.
It follows recent reported sightings of drones in the vicinity of the Glasgow Airport flightpath.
Drone operators are being reminded that it is a criminal offence to fly them near airports without permission.
warnings have been issued by Police Scotland, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and airport operators.
Every airport and airfield is protected by a flight restriction zone and drone operators cannot fly there without permission of the airfield operator and air traffic control.
Insp David Ferguson, of Police Scotland's aviation security and safety unit, said: ""There has been a significant growth in the use of drones and Police Scotland works in partnership with the CAA and airport operators to ensure compliant use.
""What may seem like a harmless pastime or hobby could have potentially catastrophic consequences if the drone is flown in a location which poses a threat to aircraft.
""We also actively engage with drone pilots to encourage responsible use of the aircraft and ensure they do not interfere with the operations at airports as well as more rural airfields.""
Jonathan Nicholson from the UK Civil Aviation Authority, said: ""Drones can be great fun but people must fly them safely and follow the rules. Breaking the CAA's Dronecode and failing to fly responsibly could result in criminal prosecution, including imprisonment.
""Anyone operating a drone must do so responsibly and observe all relevant rules and regulations. The rules for flying drones are designed to keep everybody safe.""
A spokesperson for Glasgow Airport added: ""Operating a drone or unmanned aircraft within the airport's flight restriction zone is a criminal offence and those convicted of doing so could face up to five years in prison and an unlimited fine.
""The flight restriction zone extends to a 2.5 nautical mile circle radius from the runway with extensions out with protecting the flightpath for arrival and departures.
""Endangering the crew and passengers of an aircraft is extremely dangerous and could lead to a catastrophic loss of life.
""Members of the public who witness or are aware of anyone operating a drone near our airfield should contact Police Scotland immediately."""	/news/uk-scotland-63471599
entertainment	Peter Kay announces return to stand-up during I'm A Celebrity	"Comedian Peter Kay has announced his return to stand-up with his first live tour in 12 years.
49-year-old has been largely absent from the spotlight since he cancelled his 2017 tour due to ""unforeseen family circumstances"".
Announcing his new live dates, Kay said: ""It's good to get back to what I love doing best, stand-up comedy.""
His comeback was announced during an ad break in the series launch of ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!
DJ Chris Moyles, rugby player Mike Tindall and singer Boy George were all seen entering the jungle in Sunday's opening episode, but the former health secretary Matt Hancock will not appear until later in the series. 
During the commercial break, Kay was seen carrying a rolled-up carpet into a house while confirming to nearby fans he will return to stand-up comedy next month.
median will embark on a new UK arena tour, spanning from December to August 2023.
What is it like seeing Peter Kay live 38 times?
By Daniel Rosney, BBC News Entertainment reporter
Back in 2010 I worked as a yellow blazer-wearing steward (""no filming of the stage, please"") at the Manchester Arena - something Peter Kay himself had previously done - and it was there that The Tour That Doesn't Tour Tour was on for 20 nights.
It later did go on tour, and returned for a further 20 shows.
Fans would cry tears of laughter at his opening gambit about those in their seats being his employer for the night, along with his impressions of people using an ""I'm ill"" voice to call their boss and bunk off work for the day. 
He'd reference his old jokes as well: ""Every time I go to an Italian restaurant, they give me free garlic bread… it's why my new catch-phrase is plas-ma… plas-ma…."" (because he wanted a free TV set).
While the routine was largely the same every show, I still laughed out loud each time, along with those seeing it for the first time. His observational comedy was something everyone could relate to.
""Have we got any teachers in?"" he'd ask. There'd be a cheer. ""Woah, woah, woah, no shouting out, put your hands up, one rule for one…""
But it was his encore which proved he's a true showman. He'd impersonate Freddie Mercury, using a shovel as a make-shift guitar, belting out the hits he and audiences loved. 
After a near two-hour comedy gig he became a rock star and people would be on their feet wanting more and they're finally getting it. 
I didn't get to keep my yellow blazer when I traded it in for a BBC lanyard, but given Peter Kay sometimes wore one to show his fans to their seats, he might get one dry-cleaned, just in case.
will mark Kay's first live tour since 2010, when he scored the Guinness World Record for the biggest selling stand-up tour of all time, playing to more than 1.2 million people.
rt concluded with the fans asking Kay whether he had finally bought his mother a bungalow - a reference the comic's previous Mum Wants A Bungalow tour. Kay replied that he had, explaining that his mother now wanted a new carpet to go in it.
In a statement, the Bolton-born comic said: ""It's good to get back to what I love doing best, stand-up comedy, and if there's ever a time people need a laugh it's now.
""And with the cost of living at an all-time high, ticket prices are starting from £35 - the same price they were on my previous tour in 2010.""
Kay will begin his tour on 2 December at the Manchester AO Arena before visiting locations including Birmingham, Liverpool, Sheffield, Belfast, Newcastle, Glasgow and Dublin.
His run will end on 11 August at the Sheffield Utilita Arena. London was absent from the tour locations listed in the advert.
A poster for the event featured Kay holding a sign reading, ""Better late than never"" and described a ticket to his shows as an ""ideal Christmas gift"".
Kay has kept a low profile in recent years. He notably returned to the stage in August 2021 for two special charity events to raise money for Laura Nuttall, a then 20-year-old with an aggressive type of brain cancer called glioblastoma multiforme.
re was also a brief return in January 2021 when he appeared on BBC Radio 2 for a conversation with Cat Deeley - who was filling in after Graham Norton left the station - about his love of music, mixtapes and the musical Mamma Mia.
He also made a surprise appearance at a charity screening of his series Car Share in 2018."	/news/entertainment-arts-63537991
health	Dumfries and Galloway's Covid vaccination effort outlined	"re closing in on 500,000 Covid vaccinations in Dumfries and Galloway over the past two years.
rea has one of the highest rates of delivery in mainland Scotland.
Annan-based senior immunisation nurse Jane Naylor has played a significant part in carrying out that programme across the region.
She has not kept count of how many people she has vaccinated but it runs to thousands. ""I've jabbed a fair few folk, put it that way,"" she said.
Covid shook up her life as an immunisation nurse.
""We were a very small team of maybe about 15 to 20 people,"" she said.
""We worked quietly behind the scenes, vaccinating children, the elderly - you know - everything from the cradle to the grave.
""We were so small that nobody really knew about us - we just got on with it and protected everybody.""
was before it ""all kicked off"" and the team was switched to carrying out Covid swab tests in April 2020.
""I must admit we were absolutely petrified because it was scary - we didn't know what to expect really,"" she said.
""There were days when we we just stood and we cried because we just thought: 'I don't want to come into work - I really don't'.
""But we did, we came in and we saw some really poorly people driving up in cars, got them tested and away they went.""
Of their normal work, only baby vaccinations carried on - everything else was put on hold until the first Covid vaccines came out in December that year.
""Even that was scary times,"" said Jane.
""We weren't quite sure what to expect from this Pfizer vaccine because we were told you can't move it once you have mixed it up.
""You felt as if you had like a ticking time bomb in your hands, thinking I'd better not move that as if it was going to explode or something.""
She went out into care homes and then to vaccination centres at Mountainhall in Dumfries and the Newington Sports Centre in Annan.
Jane said it was great to be able to give out vaccines.
""That was brilliant, that was amazing - we just thought thank goodness for that because we are going to protect people and as a nurse that's what you want to do,"" she said.
""You want to make people well, you want to keep them well, you want to make them feel safe.
""It was an absolute relief, not only for us - but I think for the general public as well, to say thank goodness, we're actually going to see a light at the end of the tunnel.""
She moved from delivering vaccinations to overseeing the whole project but reckons she must have administered thousands of injections over the past two years.
A team of seven or eight at the Newington Sports Centre would deal with about 400 people a day.
""On average we would probably do about 60 people a day and that was five days a week so you would be doing, you know, over 300-a-week,"" she said.
""There's probably people that have done a lot more than me.""
As well as at the main centres, the team travelled across the area to Canonbie, Langholm, Moffat, Lockerbie and Lochmaben.
She said people in Dumfries and Galloway had been great - although there were exceptions.
""You get people that come in that are quite argumentative actually,"" she said.
""They come in and they say: 'I'm not having that vaccine'.
""I try to explain to my patients these diseases haven't gone away - your dyptheria, tetanus, polio, whooping cough - it is just that we have protected ourselves against the worst of those symptoms.""
She said it was all about giving a ""positive message"" about vaccines and, now, encouraging people not to give in to ""vaccine fatigue"".
""A little jab in your arm to save your life - I don't think that's much to ask,"" she said.
""We are not asking you to run a marathon, we are just asking you to sit down, listen to us for a couple of minutes, get a jab and bye-bye and thank you very much.""
She said that Scotland's response had been impressive.
""We've just stepped up and done it and that's it,"" she said.
""You know it just has to be done.
""And that's a great attitude to have - it is very Scottish - come on, just get on with it."""	/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-63987721
politics	Rishi Sunak aims to bring factions together in cabinet reshuffle	"Rishi Sunak has appointed his team of top ministers, on his first day as the UK's prime minister.
In a key speech outside No 10, he said he wanted to bring the country and party together, promising economic stability and confidence.
reshuffle saw some predictable choices, and some that have surprised MPs. 
""Unity, experience and continuity in some really key roles,"" are the themes No 10 say they wanted to convey.
So, what can we read into who is staying, who is going, and what it all means?
No 10's message is echoed by the former director of communications for David Cameron, Sir Craig Oliver, who said: ""Unity is the watchword of this reshuffle. It's clear each part of the party will feel represented in some way. 
""Mr Sunak's also not exiled big beasts to the backbenches where they can cause trouble - like Truss did with Michael Gove."" 
Another of the notable elements of this reshuffle is the stability in three of the top jobs: Jeremy Hunt as chancellor, James Cleverly as foreign secretary and Ben Wallace as defence secretary.
kely intended to be a clear message that, particularly during the war in Ukraine and economic turmoil of the last few months, Mr Sunak wants to reassure MPs he can offer stability.
Mr Hunt ditched most of the tax cuts former PM Liz Truss brought in, reverting the economic plan to one more closely resembling Mr Sunak's proposals during the summer leadership contest.
He and Mr Sunak have talked about the need for ""difficult decisions"", something we are likely to hear more about on 31 October when they set out the government's next budget. 
As well as a signal of stability, keeping Boris Johnson ally Mr Wallace as defence secretary - and Mr Cleverly as foreign secretary - is an olive branch to some of the senior MPs who did not back Mr Sunak.
""This cabinet brings the talents of the party together"", said a No 10 source, speaking about the conclusion of the reshuffle.
""It reflects a unified party and a cabinet with significant experience, ensuring that at this uncertain time there is continuity at the heart of the government.""
rd work would begin now and the new cabinet would ""deliver for the British people"". 
A senior government source told the BBC Mr Cleverly's appointment would allow ""stability at the Foreign Office"" and means ""continuity for the UK's relationships around the world"". 
Indeed, Mr Cleverly's social media feeds, as the reshuffle progressed, were full of pictures of him calling foreign government representatives. 
, though, shows Penny Mordaunt paid the price for not dropping out of the leadership race sooner. 
It was widely reported she had been vying for the foreign secretary role. She remains as Leader of the House of Commons, the job that ensures government legislation gets through Parliament.
One potential clash coming down the line, however, is over defence spending. 
Mr Wallace has made it clear in the past he wants defence spending to rise to 3% of national income by 2030. That's not something the new chancellor has committed to as part of his plans to make efficiencies (read: cuts), in government.
One of the most eye-catching appointments was the return of Suella Braverman as home secretary. 
She resigned just days ago from the role after a security breach, when she sent a government document to someone not authorised to receive it.
She endorsed Mr Sunak to be the new leader two days ago, a move seen as a massive boost for his campaign as it represented support from the right-wing of the party. 
Some sources in government speculate that endorsement may well have been an ask for something in return. There was a hint of that in her article for the Daily Telegraph backing Mr Sunak - where she said we will ""only stop boats crossing the Channel"" if the UK passes new laws to limit the impact of Modern Slavery laws, the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights. 
Such a move would be controversial, and face legal and political challenges - especially in the House of Lords. But is her appointment a signal Mr Sunak has agreed it is the way forward? It looks likely. 
Former No 10 pollster James Johnson tweeted that the tougher approach on immigration provides an opening for the Tories among swing voters in so-called Red Wall seats.
""Suella Braverman's reappointment is the most eye-catching,"" says Sir Craig. 
""There's a lot he is going to be doing that the right of the party will be uncomfortable with - for example around the budget and economy. 
""So this [signal of a harder line on immigration] means he can point to something that really goes down well with the more traditional wings of MPs and party members."" 
But her appointment may make it harder to make the argument, as Mr Sunak did earlier, that this would be a government of ""integrity"" - given her recent breach.
Mr Sunak has also brought back some key supporters to senior roles - like Dominic Raab, Steve Barclay and Oliver Dowden. They were key figures in his campaign throughout the summer, rewarded for their loyalty with roles back in government. 
Mr Dowden's return was welcomed by former cabinet minister Sir David Lidington, who said: ""No-one in the current government has a sharper understanding of the machinery of government, and how to turn slogans and paper projects into practical outcomes.""
Simon Hart has also been brought in as chief whip, responsible for party discipline and MPs' welfare. This role will be key, after months of internal infighting, to anticipate any potential rebellions or conflicts and keep Tory MPs toeing the party line. 
He's got cabinet experience as the former Welsh secretary, but also experience trying to bring different factions of the party together - something he did during the Brexit years - and is close friends with former chief whip Gavin Williamson and leader of the influential 1922 backbench committee of MPs Sir Graham Brady. 
Nadhim Zahawi, briefly chancellor over the summer, has received a slight demotion from Cabinet Office minister, to chair of the party - perhaps in response to his flip-flopping support over the last few months. 
He'll still have a tough job ahead of local elections next year - and will partly be responsible for showing the party can turn its electoral fortunes around after a series of record-low opinion polls. 
While Mr Sunak has reached out to some senior figures who backed his rivals Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, others have been shown the door. 
Boris Johnson ally Jake Berry, the former party chairman, is out, as is the former Levelling Up Secretary Simon Clarke - a significant backer of Liz Truss and her plans. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg, as widely expected, is no longer business secretary. Only days ago, he'd said the party was 'Boris or Bust' - and he has openly criticised Mr Sunak. Sunak allies will not miss him. 
wo have been replaced by loyalist Grant Shapps as business secretary and the return of Michael Gove as levelling up secretary, which he held under Boris Johnson. 
wo were key in orchestrating MPs to rebel against Ms Truss's plans to cut the top rate of tax for the highest earners, a thorn in her side at the Tory party conference causing her to U-turn. 
resulting Cabinet is somewhat of a Tory party coalition - with senior figures from the left, right and centre of the party. 
(mammoth) aim is to unite the party, after years of clashes over personalities and policies, from Brexit and Boris Johnson, to tax cuts, immigration and fracking. 
will be when the new prime minister tries new policies, and makes the ever-euphemised ""difficult decisions"" on the economy that could involve some spending cuts or tax rises.
It remains to be seen if having a broad church of figures at the top will be enough to stave off dissent on the backbenches."	/news/uk-politics-63394099
technology	Elon Musk suspends Kanye West from Twitter for inciting violence	"Kanye West has been suspended from Twitter and accused of ""inciting violence"" over offensive tweets - just two months after his last ban.
US rapper, who now goes by the name Ye, posted a series of erratic tweets - one of which appeared to show a symbol combining a swastika and a Jewish star.
witter's new boss Elon Musk was asked by one user to ""fix Kanye"".
West had ""violated our rule against incitement to violence"", Musk tweeted.
""Account will be suspended,"" Musk wrote in a Twitter post.
Also on Thursday, during an interview with US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and with his face covered in a mask, West praised Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and ranted about sin, pornography and the devil.
f the UK's Holocaust Educational Trust described West's comments as ""repulsive and sickening"". 
""These comments mixed with his high profile and huge following have dangerous consequences,"" chief executive Karen Pollock said.
In recent months West has caused controversy with a series of antisemitic and racist remarks - leading to clothing giant Adidas cutting ties with the rapper.
West was initially locked out of his Twitter and Instagram accounts after posting antisemitic messages in October. Both platforms removed West's posts - which accused rapper Diddy of being controlled by Jewish people - saying the star had violated policies on hate speech.
me in response to a backlash against his show at Paris Fashion Week, where he wore a T-shirt carrying the slogan ""White Lives Matter"".
Anti-Defamation League in the US branded his phrase ""hate speech"" and attributed it to white supremacists, who began using it in 2015 in response to the Black Lives Matter movement.
Earlier this year, West was suspended from Instagram for 24 hours in March after using a racial slur in reference to comedian Trevor Noah.
In 2018, singer Will.i.am led a backlash against West after he claimed the enslavement of African-Americans over centuries may have been a ""choice"" - remarks he later tried to clarify.
His latest Twitter ban comes hours after the right-wing social media platform Parler - which styles itself as a ""free speech"" alternative to mainstream platforms - said West could no longer buy the firm.
In a statement, Parlement Technologies said: ""The company has mutually agreed with Ye to terminate the intent of sale."" 
firm - which runs the much smaller platform, popular with conservatives and the far right - said the decision was made in mid-November.
""Parler will continue to pursue future opportunities for growth and the evolution of the platform for our vibrant community,"" the firm said in its statement.
Musk took control over Twitter in October and immediately embarked on a series of radical changes within the social media giant - including lifting the bans on controversial accounts.
He has clarified that he had no role in bringing West back on Twitter, saying the account was restored before he acquired the social media platform.
West was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago and has publicly spoken about his challenges with his mental health.
However, medical experts and people who share West's condition have warned that mental health problems do not go hand-in-hand with antisemitism."	/news/business-63826675

health	South West Acute Hospital temporarily loses emergency general surgery	"Emergency general surgery is to be temporarily withdrawn from South West Acute Hospital (SWAH) in Enniskillen, the Western Health Trust has said.
rust said this was necessary to protect the public's safety after it had problems recruiting surgical staff.
Despite saying the move was temporary, the trust did not say when it expected emergency general surgery would resume.
mergency department and other services including obstetrics will continue to operate as normal. 
Other - mostly lower grade - surgeons will remain on site at the County Fermanagh hospital.
will stabilise patients before they are transferred by ambulance to the likes of Altnagelvin Area Hospital in Londonderry, Craigavon Area Hospital in County Armagh or Sligo University Hospital across the border in the Republic of Ireland.
Local groups have said they are concerned that the road infrastructure does not support a quick transfer of patients from Enniskillen to Altnagelvin, Craigavon or hospitals in Belfast.  
In a further move it has been confirmed the hospital is to become Northern Ireland's third elective surgical hub.
In October, emergency general surgery was ""temporarily"" moved from Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry to Craigavon Area Hospital. 
Geraldine McKay, the trust's director of acute services, explained the decision was taken because of a lack of consultant surgeons. 
She said a consultant in the general surgery team had recently resigned.
means that emergency general surgery will stop at SWAH on 18 December.
""Despite our previous and ongoing efforts to recruit, we have not been successful to date in securing the necessary consultant workforce,"" Ms McKay said.
""The trust is therefore now unable to maintain the required workforce to sustain and deliver a safe emergency (unplanned) general surgical service to our population from SWAH.
""Put simply, we cannot provide an emergency general surgery service without a consultant surgical team in place to provide the required 24/7 cover.""
Ms McKay said the trust had done everything it could to maintain services and was disappointed by the announcement. 
She explained they had held six recruitment rounds since 2016 and in that time the hospital had gained five consultant surgeons.
However, during the same period SWAH lost six consultants - three of whom retired while the other three moved on to other jobs.
""Unfortunately we have now come to a position whereby, come the end of January, I will have no substantive [staff] consultants in post in South West Acute Hospital in the general surgical specialty.""
Speaking about the implications for patients, Ms McKay said: ""I completely understand the anxieties of the population of Fermanagh and south Tyrone, especially rural areas.""
Ms McKay said she was aware one of the key anxieties is what would happen in the case of a major road crash.
""We have agreed with emergency department team and trauma network that SWAH will remain a trauma-receiving unit,"" she said.
Emergency general surgery relates to the treatment of patients with conditions such as acute abdominal pain, infections, bleeding and trauma.
It includes operations such as removing a patient's gall bladder, appendix or part of the bowel.  
If left unattended these conditions can become life-threatening. 
According to the Western Trust, SWAH deals with about five such cases a day and that is not enough to sustain a dedicated emergency general surgical team. 
In a briefing on Thursday afternoon, the trust said there would be no change to emergency C-Section births, though if a patient is deemed at risk they will opt to deliver elsewhere.
""Fermanagh is so isolated… It's madness, people will die,"" County Fermanagh resident Jimmy Hamill told BBC News NI.
He was among people who began to gather outside Enniskillen Town Hall on Thursday evening in reaction to the announcement.
Mr Hamill described the move as ""lunacy"" and said he believed it was part of a ""choreographed plan"".
A former SWAH medic also questioned the ""temporary"" nature of the move, suggesting the trust had used that word euphemistically.
""In my experience, having worked in the health service for over 40 years, once the word temporary is used, therefore it becomes permanent,"" Prof Mahendra Varma told the BBC's Evening Extra programme. 
""So I don't accept what the Western [Trust] board is saying with regards to it being temporary.""
retired consultant cardiologist was among the medics who were involved in the establishment of the hospital 10 years ago.
Prof Varma also told the programme he did not believe the trust had made enough efforts to replace retiring surgeons.
Another former SWAH worker, Diane McCaffery, described the decision as ""shocking"".
Ms McCaffery is a retired emergency care manager who worked at SWAH's cardio assessment unit
She told BBC News NI she has seen first-hand how emergency surgery has saved lives. She said she thinks this decision is ""catastrophic"" and that Fermanagh residents were the ""poor relatives of this country"".
Western Trust said existing services including its emergency department and obstetrics remained unchanged.
It added there would be ""minimal to no impact"" on the other existing services at SWAH.   
rust said it was liaising with colleagues in the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and the Southern Health Trust on the new arrangements. 
When the hospital becomes Northern Ireland's third elective surgical hub it is planned that it will tackle waiting lists.

politics	Brexit: French tourism slump after leaving EU, Brittany Ferries says	"umber of people arriving at a UK port from France has more than halved after Brexit, a ferry firm has said.
Portsmouth ferry port saw 338,000 arrivals in 2019 but only 155,000 in 2022, according to Brittany Ferries.
firm said ""Brexit-related friction"" including a need for passports was a major factor, although sailings to and from Ireland, within the European Union, had seen increased business.
Home Office said the UK's entry rules were relatively generous.
Brittany Ferries said the vast majority of lost visitors were French holidaymakers, including student groups.
Spokesman Nigel Wonnacott said: ""We used to have loads of coaches parking outside with happy schoolchildren enjoying Portsmouth, going up to London and we really don't see much of that any more.
""Post-Brexit, French travellers are required to travel [to the UK] with a passport so it's expensive for them to get a passport because it's about 90 euros (£78), and it's also a big administrative burden.
""For Portsmouth, for the surroundings, for UK plc it's the loss of a significant number of potential travellers and all the richness that they bring economically and culturally.""
Previously the Tourism Alliance, which represents the British tourism industry, estimated a £875m loss to the UK economy from lost student groups in 2022.
Brittany Ferries said many French visitors had switched to its sailings to Ireland.
Last year saw a 30% increase in passengers travelling on its routes between Ireland, and both France and Spain, compared to 2019, the firm said.
Brittany Ferries operates services from France to Rosslare in Ireland and to Plymouth, Poole and Portsmouth in England.
A Home Office spokesman said the UK's rules were ""among the most generous in the world"".
kesman said visitors from France and other affected countries were told almost a year in advance of the requirement to use a passport from October 2021.

He has been suspended as a Conservative MP since announcing he was off to Australia. One Tory colleague described him as an ""absolute prat"" and he has faced calls from opposition politicians to give up his MP's salary, £84,144 a year.
He was appointed health secretary in 2018, before overseeing pandemic restrictions including lockdowns and social distancing.
footage, which showed him breaking his own social distancing rules with his political aide and university friend Gina Coladangelo, was leaked to the Sun. 
Dominic Cummings, who was Boris Johnson's closest advisor, claimed Mr Hancock had lied about Covid testing hospital patients before they were released into care homes. This was firmly denied by Mr Hancock. Mr Cummings also published expletive-laden messages about a different issue, purportedly from Boris Johnson, in which the PM calls the health secretary ""hopeless"".
Born and raised in Cheshire, he studied philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University and then economics at Cambridge. Before becoming MP for West Suffolk he worked for his family's computer software business and as an economist for the Bank of England. He has three children.
He's said he hopes to use his time in the jungle to raise awareness about the learning difficulty that affects reading and writing. 
In 2012, he won a charity horse race after training for three months, losing two stone in the process. Nicknamed ""Action Matt"" by the press, photos of him running, swimming and jumping over small fences often appear in the newspapers."	/news/uk-63489101

first studio dedicated to the music opened in the city in April and new shops cater to the area's fanbase.
ularity of K-pop has continued to spread with bands topping the UK album chart in the past three years.
""Seeing it grow and be able to have a place to go and buy my albums is really special,"" one fan, Hannah, said.
KPOPPINUK, which claims to be the first dedicated K-pop shop in Birmingham, held a photo-trading-card event on 4 December to allow fans to meet friends and buy merchandise.   
Owner Jane Langley said: ""We have a really big community, it's about having somewhere to buy albums physically and also being able to interact personally with other fans."" 
Fan Lexy said she used to be made fun of at school for liking the chart-topping music, but she said it was considered more normal now and ""the atmosphere at K-pop concerts is really friendly"".

Korean-exchange student Hayoon said she felt welcomed by the growing British interest in Korean pop culture.

Annette Dolan, who runs Bath Aqua Glass, currently pays £14,000 a year, but is facing the steep rise at the end of September when her contract ends.
She said it would mean the price of a vase made at her glassblowing studio in Bath rising from £45 to £350.
Some businesses are already facing price rises in excess of 200% as gas and electricity prices soar.
Ms Dolan said she was concerned for the future of her business.
furnace at the Walcot Street business runs day and night, enabling staff to create handmade items including jewellery, jugs and stained glass.
But the increase has left Ms Dolan wondering how she is going to meet the costs.
""There's no way that we can actually operate at that level,"" she said.
""My bookkeeper and I are both having massive sleepless nights. We're both thinking, 'What are we going to do'?
""It's a nightmare. The brokers have been trying to get me to sign and I'm saying this is untenable, I cannot sign.""
Ms Dolan has worked in the glassblowing business for 26 years and says she will do all she can to keep the firm running.
""Whether I'm going to save this business or not only the future will tell me, but I will do my damndest for all my staff and myself,"" she added.
Energies, Ms Dolan's energy provider, said it offered a range of products to suit customer needs and advised customers to contact them if they are having difficulty paying.

business	New Year's Eve parties hit by rail strikes and cost of living	"New Year's Eve celebrations look set to be hit by rail strikes and the cost of living crisis as industry experts say bars and restaurant bookings are down.
One in three reservations were cancelled in December, when the sector lost £2.3bn, UK Hospitality said.
re is ""huge"" concern that strikes will further hit New Year bookings and result in job losses in January, the Night Time Industries Association said.
government says it is doing all it can to mitigate the impact of strikes.
Paul Kohler, owner of the CellarDoor a cocktail and cabaret bar in London's West End, was hoping the first New Year celebrations since coronavirus restrictions would go with a bang. 
But he told BBC Breakfast rail strikes were a big factor in party plans fizzling out. 
""New Year bookings are down again, we are hoping it will be good but people are losing faith in the transport system, they are worried about getting home at night,"" he said.
rain services continue to be hit by cancellations and delays as rail workers stage a series of national strikes in a dispute over pay, job security and working conditions.
Kate Nichols, chief executive of industry organisation UK Hospitality told BBC Breakfast losses in December were worse than expected due to rail worker walk outs.
""We know that when the train strikes were announced... you saw cancellation rates as high as 50-60% in the centre of London and 20-30% around the rest of the country directly attributable to those strike days.""
Meanwhile, with the cost of living in the UK near a record high, people are cutting down on going out at the same time that business running costs are going up.
Angela Baker from Bolton, owns Bakers coffee shop, bar and restaurant in Egerton, and Courses by Bakers restaurant at Turton Golf Club.
She said bookings over Christmas were ""quieter than usual"" and her New Year's Eve tickets were 70% to 80% sold.
""I think they're nervous about what's happening next with the cost of living crisis,"" she added.
""We've found Covid is still impacting us,"" said Ms Baker. ""We've had people cancelling over the last few days due to Covid and lots of staff off ill.""
She said while the costs of running her businesses were rising she did not want to have to up prices when her customers were struggling themselves.
Mr Kohler said he paid his staff the Real Living Wage for London of £11.95 an hour, which is more than the National Living Wage - known as the minimum wage - of £9.50.
Combined with ""costs going up and up"", his ""profits are shrinking"", Mr Kohler said. 
""We don't have any profits at this stage - we are just surviving... hospitality is in real danger at the moment,"" he added.
Many businesses have lost up to 50% of trade during the festive period which they were relying heavily on to see them through early 2023, said Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association.
Mr Kill said the government's delay in announcing any further help on energy bills for businesses had left many facing further uncertainty. 
""We will without doubt now see a huge swathe of businesses and jobs lost in January due to the government's inaction,"" he added.
It comes after the British Beer and Pub Association said 386 pubs closed in England & Wales in 2022, with thousands more looking at altering their opening hours this winter to survive.
going cost of living crisis combined with further strike action means it is ""going to undoubtedly be a very tough first quarter of the year for hospitality"", said Ms Nichols from UK Hospitality.
raditionally, bumper profits in December driven by Christmas celebrations make up for lower takings in January and February, she said.
But this year has seen ""much more profitable sales in December being lost,"" she said. ""That means those businesses are much more vulnerable and fragile.""
Mr Kohler urged ministers to negotiate with rail workers to end strikes and to give more support on energy bills and business rates.
""Hospitality will die unless we get a grip,"" he said.
Ms Baker said: ""I have had a number of friends who have lost or chosen to walk away from the hospitality business post-pandemic, and because of the cost of living.
""I have staff who were landladies who both gave up their pubs and came to work with me,"" she added.
Ms Baker said hospitality businesses like hers relied on busy Christmas and New Year periods to help them weather the quieter winter months ahead.
""With Courses being at a golf club, the season doesn't start again until March so we are expecting a quiet couple of months,"" she said.
""But even with Bakers coffee shop, January is a notoriously tough month because everybody starts the new year with good intentions.""
government said it recognised this was a difficult time for hospitality and night time businesses and said ""we remain firmly on their side"". 
A spokesperson highlighted the Energy Bill Relief Scheme and a Business Rates package they said was worth £13.6billion over the next five years.
""We are doing all we can to mitigate the impact of this strike action, but the only way to stop the disruption completely is for union bosses to get back round the table and call off these damaging strikes,"" the spokesperson said."	/news/business-64124916

Employees are tweeting using the hashtag #LoveWhereYouWorked and a saluting emoji to say they are leaving.
Yash Agarwal, who worked in public policy, said it was ""the greatest privilege ever"" to work for Twitter.
In an internal email, the social media company said the cuts are ""an effort to place Twitter on a healthy path"".
firm added that its offices would be temporarily closed, with staff unable to enter the building until they know if they have lost their jobs.
multi-billionaire will be Twitter's chief executive after buying the firm last week in a $44bn (£39.3bn) deal.
""We will go through the difficult process of reducing our global workforce on Friday,"" Twitter said in the email.
""We recognise this will impact a number of individuals who have made valuable contributions to Twitter, but this action is unfortunately necessary to ensure the company's success moving forward,"" it added.
mpany said office access would be immediately limited ""to help ensure the safety of each employee as well as Twitter systems and customer data"".
All staff are set to receive an email with the subject ""Your Role at Twitter"" by 09:00 Pacific time (16:00 GMT) on Friday.
Workers who are not affected will be notified through their company email, according to Twitter. 
Meanwhile, those who are affected will be told of the ""next steps"" through their personal accounts.
""Given the nature of our distributed workforce and our desire to inform impacted individuals as quickly as possible, communications for this process will take place via email,"" Twitter said.

form struggles to make a profit. One way to fix the problem is by making a dent in the wage bill.
Simon Balmain, a senior community manager for Twitter in the UK, told the BBC that he believed he has been laid off, because he was logged out of his work laptop and Slack messaging programme.
""Everyone got an email saying that there was going to be a large reduction in headcount, and then around an hour later, folks started getting their laptops remotely wiped and access to Slack and Gmail revoked,"" he said.
""Most UK folks are probably asleep and don't know yet. I was working mostly LA (Los Angeles) hours because of the projects I was on, so was still awake when it happened.""
Another Twitter worker said he was anxiously waiting for an email to arrive, confirming whether he still had a job.
He said he would probably stay up late to wait for the message.
""The exodus of talent from this lay-off will reshape the whole technology industry as we know it. We're all looking out for each other and the outreach of love and support has been incredible to see,"" Mr Balmain said. 
Bloomberg, citing unnamed sources, suggested some senior staff were asked to make lists of employees to be cut on their teams. 
Cryptocurrency platform Binance invested in Twitter as part of Mr Musk's takeover. Earlier, Changpeng Zhao, its chief executive, said that ""a slimmer workforce would make more sense"".
Mr Zhao, who was speaking at the Web Summit in Lisbon, also criticised the platform for having been slow to roll out new features, given its level of staffing.
-cutting follows criticism of Twitter's efforts to raise money by proposing to charge $8 (£7) a month for a ""verified"" blue check-mark.
In addition to the verification badge, those who pay could have their tweets promoted more widely and see fewer adverts.
Mr Musk has tweeted of his plan: ""We need to pay the bills somehow."" 
witter has not made a profit in several years and its number of users has remained fairly static at about 300 million a month.
Many experts suggest that Mr Musk, the world's richest man, overpaid for the company, given current economic conditions and the depressed values of many tech stocks.
But Brandon Borrman, Twitter's former head of global communications, in a BBC interview, questioned how Twitter could justify asking people to pay in order to remain on an ""equal playing field"" with other users.
It is not clear how the cuts will affect the platform's operations. Mr Musk has a reputation for being ruthless when it comes to staff.
US media reports already speak of long hours spent by some staff to meet Mr Musk's demands in the aftermath of the takeover.
In May, Mr Musk said his work ethic expectations would be ""extreme"", but less than he demanded of himself.
As part of the takeover agreement, nine members of Twitter's board departed the company, leaving self-styled ""Chief Twit"" Mr Musk as the sole director.
move was seen as cementing Mr Musk's control over the company.
Among those leaving were chairman Bret Taylor and chief executive Parag Agrawal. 
Other senior figures have also posted about leaving, or are reported to have left, including chief financial officer Ned Segal.
As senior figures left, US media reported that a number of Mr Musk's allies joined Twitter.

When it was announced that both husband and wife would represent GB in Tokyo, Laura said she ""massively underestimated how hard it would be to juggle both being a parent and us both being athletes"".external-link
As the 29-year-old was making her return to the sport after giving birth, an endeavour in which she was supported by fellow mum and Olympic champion Jess Ennis-Hill, she said she had to build her training around Albie rather than the other way round.
ge was made even more difficult by the coronavirus lockdown, meaning the pair could no longer rely on the support of grandparents to help care for Albie while they trained.
But the Kennys are ""tough"", says six-time Olympic champion Sir Chris Hoy.
ughness is what it took for Laura to return from a broken shoulder and arm sustained 18 months before the Games.
It is how Jason, 33, got back to being one of Britain's best after taking a year away from the sport post-Rio.
And toughness has surely been required to do all of that while raising a toddler.
""Albie came along and it just changed everything,"" Laura told the BBC before the Games.
""I just sort of relaxed a lot more. Every time I go home I just switch off. I always thought I wanted to be a young mum and I didn't want to let it get in the way of my career.
""I wanted to prove to myself that I could do both.""
Albie might make the logistics of finding time to train more complicated, but as both aimed to make their mark in the history books he has also provided vital motivation.
""I'd never been injured before, certainly not to that extent,"" she said of the injuries sustained in two major crashes in early 2020.
""It was the hardest couple of weeks in my career because I thought 'why am I doing this?' I do it all for Albie now. I've not sacrificed all this time with him for no reason.""
Jason now has nine medals in total, adding keirin gold and team sprint silver in Tokyo, to surpass Sir Bradley Wiggins, who also has eight in all.
According to data company Nielsen Gracenote, between them the married couple have won a third of all the gold medals claimed by Great Britain in the history of Olympic track cycling.
Sir Chris knows what it takes to achieve such greatness but he never tried to do it while being a parent, instead waiting until he had retired to have children.
""I've got no idea [what that's like],"" he said.
""It adds another dimension to the stress and difficulty that being a parent can bring.
""It balances it out with the joy you get from it and also the perspective. When you are lining up for an Olympic final, perspective is one of the things that can really help you cope with pressure.
""They complement each other. Jason's calmness can settle Laura when she might get a bit nervous or worry about things too much. She drags Jason up and picks his spirits up. They live for their sport and for their little boy Albie. 
""It just makes you so happy to see nice folk succeeding in life.""
Even their relationship has followed Olympic cycles. Laura took to Twitter to announce they were ""dating"" when they were caught kissing on camera at the London 2012 beach volleyball final.
got married after returning from Rio 2016 and Albie was born a year later.
r are now adding a Tokyo chapter to their Olympic story and both Jason and Hoy believe there will be much more to come from Laura at Paris 2024. And Jason hasn't 100% ruled out a fifth Games appearance.
Jason said before the Games his wife would ""trump"" any medal record he sets, adding it ""would be short-lived"".
""In two or three Games' time we will be looking back and Laura could have 10 gold medals,"" Hoy agreed. ""The best is possibly yet to come from Laura. I firmly expect Laura to be standing alone above Jason and above Bradley.""
And Laura may not even be the most successful Kenny, with Albie apparently well on the way in his cycling education.
""He's got a lot of expectation,"" joked Sir Chris.
""The poor lad has got a lot of pressure. He's got to take up something entirely different."""	/sport/olympics/58069122

Some members at the Goju-Ryu Karate Academy in Newcastle, said they were uncomfortable wearing the suits.

Earlier this year it was announced female competitors at Wimbledon would be allowed to wear dark-coloured undershorts from next year.
ge black belt member Sylvie Gatherar approached her teacher with the idea.
15-year-old said: ""I think it's important to talk about things with your mentors in sport.
""Wearing white is like a paranoia in the back of your mind thinking 'what if this happens?', and that can affect performance and make it hard to concentrate. 
""I also think a lot of women don't do martial arts as they think it's too male-based.""
Mr Milan-Vega said he was ""keen to listen"" to his female members and has given all members the option of wearing darker trousers with the traditional white karate top.
""Maybe it's been a bit taboo in the past but it's important men listen and open it up for debate,"" he said.
""We used to be male-dominated but now we've got four women black belts and we're trying to make the sport more comfortable.""

North Tyneside Council said it had a peak of Ukrainians fleeing Russian attacks arriving in April and May. 
While the authority had access to translation services, council officers said the facilities ""were just not enough"" to cope with the high demand.
Officers added they were using everything they could to provide help.

Ian Rice, the authority's welfare and tenancy support manager, said: ""We do throughout the authority have access to interpreters and translation services. 
What we very quickly found was that whilst we do have access to those facilities, the numbers, particularly in April and May time, were just not enough.
""So, we used Google Translate.""
Council staff also used a translating service on Microsoft Word to email and correspond with Ukrainian guests, which officers acknowledged ""might not always be perfect"".
However, officers claimed no guests had yet complained and added it had helped open up dialogue. 
fficers added that professional translation services were sought for more complex circumstances.
In addition, several refugees had also stepped forward to help officers as interpreters.
""We have had a couple of our Ukrainian guests help us out and volunteer to translate and a number of our guests who are school teachers have helped,"" Mr Rice continued.
""We are using everything we possibly can to help and support them and quite a number of them speak quite good English,"" Mr Rice said.

politics	Nimco Ali: Adviser to step down to avoid serving under Braverman	"government's independent adviser on violence against women has said she does not want to serve under Suella Braverman and will not continue.
On live radio, Nimco Ali said she was on a ""completely different planet"" to the home secretary when it came to women's rights and ethnic minorities.
Ms Ali was appointed when her friend Boris Johnson was prime minister.
A source close to the home secretary said Ms Ali's contract was coming to an end before Christmas.
: ""The home secretary is determined to make our streets and homes safer for women and girls.
""She will continue to focus on this policy and the rights of women and girls to live safely in our country.""
Home Office said they had not received any formal resignation and were therefore not commenting.
Ms Ali was being interviewed on Times Radio  when she said she would not ""feel comfortable in serving under Suella"".
""Suella and I are on completely different planets when it comes to the rights of women and girls and also the way that we talk about ethnic minorities,"" she said.
Ms Ali said Ms Braverman had different approaches to ""people like me who are from a refugee background"".
She also questioned if the home secretary shared her ""feminist ideals"". 
When pressed on whether she would remain as an adviser, she said ""ultimately no, I'm not going to continue"".
move comes hours after the home secretary agreed to back a bill criminalising street harassment. 
Ms Ali had a major role in preparing the ground work for the bill and led a consultation into making street harassment a specific crime while serving under former home secretary Priti Patel.
Ms Ali was appointed to her role by Ms Patel in October 2020.
BBC understands there has been no decision about appointing someone else to the role of Independent Adviser on Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls.
Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called Ms Ali's decision ""damning for Suella Braverman"". 
Ms Cooper said: ""Those around her clearly don't think she's capable of doing the job. 
""It shows how weak Rishi Sunak was to appoint her. More chaos at the heart of this Tory government.""

""I don't think everyone is ready for Martin Lewis's singing voice,"" Mark told BBC News. ""He puts me to shame"".
Proceeds from the song will be shared equally between food bank charity The Trussell Trust and the Band Aid foundation.
LadBaby made chart history last year when their collaboration with Ed Sheeran and Sir Elton John, Sausage Rolls For Everyone, became their fourth consecutive UK Christmas number one.

Lewis said he was amazed to have been approached for help.

health	RSV: Children's clinic extends hours to cut hospital admissions	"A clinic which treats children and babies with respiratory issues has extended its hours to try and ease pressure on hospital admissions.
York's Children's Ambulatory Treatment (CAT) Hub will now open five days a week, up from two.
rincipal cause for child hospital stays is winter bug Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).
Nationally, almost 30,000 hospital admissions come as a result of the virus each year.
Dr Daniel Kimberling said the hub, which treats under 12s with all respiratory illnesses, was ramping up operations after seeing a rise in cases of children attending hospital.
""We want to be ready for winter,"" the medical director added.
Sources: UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), NHS, House of Lords Library
Dr Brown said the service, which includes experienced children's nurses working alongside a GP, was able to spend more time with children and their parents.
""In a GP surgery you might have 15 minutes,"" she said.
""You've not got the time to sit down with parents and explore all of their worries and provide that education about what they can do at home.""
Children are referred to the clinic by GPs or other health professionals and are monitored for two hours, enabling decisions to be made about what care or treatment is needed.
Libby, who had taken her daughter to the clinic, said it was much easier to access and be reassured about her daughter's health than go to hospital.
""We'd normally have to go to A&E and spend about six hours to get the same treatment, just for one tiny bit of medication.""
UK's health regulator recently approved a new treatment for RSV.
gle antibody shot helps stop infants getting chest infections, such as pneumonia, for about six months.
A large study has now begun to find out whether nirsevimab should be offered to all babies in the UK.
Other treatments for RSV already exist and trials of a vaccine have also shown promise.

health	Top hospitals targeted by nurse strikes	"A host of leading hospitals will be affected in next month's nurse strikes, the Royal College of Nursing says.
ude Great Ormond Street and Alder Hey children's hospitals and leading cancer centres.
Overall, around a quarter of hospitals and community services in England and nearly all those in Northern Ireland and Wales will see nurses walkout on 15 and 20 December.
Emergency care will continue to be provided during the strike action.
In total, 76 NHS organisations will see nurses walk out.
ude leading cancer centres the Royal Marsden and Liverpool's Clatterbridge centre alongside major hospitals in Birmingham, London, Liverpool, Newcastle and West Yorkshire.
All the health boards in Northern Ireland and all-but-one in Wales, the Aneurin Bevan, will see strike action take place.
But action has been suspended in Scotland after ministers there made a fresh pay offer, which the RCN is consulting on.
Meanwhile, Unison has announced ambulance staff including paramedics and call handlers, have voted to strike in five of England's 10 ambulance services. A walkout is expected before Christmas.
urnout was too low in the remainder for the votes to count, as well as in all but two of England's hospital and community trusts.
No services in Wales voted for strike action, but a walkout will happen across all services in Northern Ireland on 12 December, Unison said.
Overall, up to 100,000 nurses could be involved in the nurse walkout the RCN says, which would amount to about a quarter of nurses in those three nations.
RCN warned the government if a deal could not be agreed more services would be involved in the strike action next year.
RCN general secretary Pat Cullen said: ""Ministers have declined my offer of formal pay negotiations and instead chosen strike action.
""It has left us with no choice. Nursing is standing up for the profession and their patients. 
""We've had enough of being taken for granted and being unable to provide the care patients deserve.""
Watch this video quiz to test your knowledge of nurses' pay
rike action will last from 08:00 to 20:00 GMT.
Under trade union laws, the RCN has to ensure life-preserving care
kely to mean some cancer services, urgent tests and scans and ongoing care for vulnerable patients will be protected alongside A&E and intensive care - although it will be up to local health bosses and union leaders to negotiate exact staffing levels on strike days.
But it seems almost certain the walkout will increase the backlog in non-urgent hospital treatment - a record seven million people are already on the waiting list in England.
GP services, however, will be unaffected as nurses working in practices were not entitled to take part in the ballot.
In England, the RCN only has mandates for strike action in just over half of NHS trusts as the turnout was too low in the rest.
For the forthcoming strikes the union's leadership has decided to only announce walkouts in around half of those eligible to take action.
RCN has called for a rise of 5% above the RPI inflation rate, which currently stands at above 14%, but no UK nation has offered close to that.
In England and Wales, NHS staff, including nurses, have been given a rise of at least £1,400 - worth about 4% on average for nurses.
In Northern Ireland, nurses are yet to receive a pay award because there is no working government.
Earlier this month Scottish ministers made a fresh offer worth more than 8% for a newly-qualified nurse, with more senior nurses being offered less. This prompted the re-starting of talks.
During the ballot - the results of which were announced two weeks ago - the RCN had argued this year's below-inflation pay award came after years of squeezes on nurse's salaries. 
But England Health Secretary Steve Barclay has said the RCN's demands are not affordable.
He has said the government had met the recommendations of the independent NHS Pay Review Body in giving its award.
And it followed a 3% pay rise last year, in recognition of work during the pandemic, despite a public-sector pay freeze.
Welsh government said it was unable to enter pay talks without extra funding from the UK government.
will only be the second time RCN members have been on strike.
In 2019, nurses in Northern Ireland walked out over pay, while nurses who are members of Unison in England walked out in 2014 over pay.
A host of other major health unions, including Unison, the Royal College of Midwives, GMB and Unite, have all started balloting members."	/news/health-63799244
