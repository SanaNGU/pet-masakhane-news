Officials had deployed frost covers across the course, and Friday's fixture went ahead, but temperatures plummeted to -5C overnight.
Racing at Doncaster and Hereford was also abandoned, while Newcastle's fixture was called off minutes before the first race was due to start. 
Sunday's fixture at Punchestown, where Cheltenham Gold Cup favourite Galopin Des Champs was set to run in the John Durkan Chase, was another casualty and is likely to be rescheduled.

business	Tesco trials renting out office space to workers	"Remote working and your weekly shop in one? Both could be possible after Tesco announced a flexible working trial with office service provider IWG.
From mid-May, people will be able to use office space created in the chain's New Malden store in London.
A flexible office area will use space in-store, with desks, co-working areas and a meeting room provided.
move highlights the continued move away from traditional office set-ups since the pandemic. 
IWG said that the trial with Tesco was reflective of ""really strong demand"" from office workers to have suburban alternatives close to home, as opposed to commuting into city centres.
""People don't want to spend hours commuting every day and instead want to live and work in their local communities,"" said Mark Dixon, founder and chief executive of IWG. 
Research from the company suggests that 72% of workers would prefer to work flexibly. 
rtnership comes as supermarkets are increasingly looking for new ways to make money from their physical stores, with many shoppers having switched to online deliveries during the Covid pandemic. 
mic and lockdowns also caused a huge shift in people's working patterns and while restrictions have eased, the latest figures suggest that the shift to flexible working is here to stay.
A survey from the Chartered Institute of Management found more than 80% of firms had now adopted hybrid-working since the end of the pandemic. 
Louise Goodland, head of strategic partnerships for Tesco, said the supermarket was always looking to ""serve customers and communities better"" and it would be interested to see the response to the trial."	/news/business-61423168
business	Call for business support amid recession fears	"Scotland's business leaders have called for more support in the face of the bleak economic outlook.
Bank of England has increased interest rates to 1.75% and warned inflation is now set to hit more than 13%.
Retail and licence trade associations said more UK and Scottish government support is needed ahead of an expected recession.
Scottish government has said its focus is on supporting the lowest paid. 
Latest data from the Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) showed footfall in July was 16.5% down on pre-pandemic levels and 0.7% worse than in June.
was larger than the UK average of 14.2%.
ummer heatwave, rail strikes and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis were all blamed.
Ewan MacDonald-Russell, head of policy at the SRC, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""As the year progresses, there is little evidence Scottish consumers are close to returning to pre-pandemic shopping patterns.
""The reality is big ticket items are down and we know people are trading down from premium goods to value goods and cutting back on spending now.
""We need action to tackle the high business rates burden and measures to help consumers, particularly less affluent consumers.""
Mr MacDonald-Russell added that ""big and punchy"" moves to help consumers were needed, adding there was no room for ""half measures""in the UK government's autumn budget.
Meanwhile, a survey of 100 businesses by the Night Time Industries Association Scotland has found 38% respondents were ""unsure"" whether they will survive the next 12 months due to soaring costs. 
majority are trading below 2019 levels of business. 
Colin Wilkinson, managing director of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association (SLTA), said this pressure was being felt across the hospitality sector and described the Bank of England's interest rate hike as ""very unwelcome"". 
He said: ""The sector continues to see a slow recovery from the pandemic and then the cost of living crisis. 
""This interest rate increase could simply be too much for our smaller operators. 
""The industry benefited greatly from the VAT cut in the pandemic and Eat Out To Help Out was successful. We don't have that now so we'd like to see a cut in VAT for the licensee hospitality sector and a complete review of the business rates.""
Scottish government business minister Ivan McKee said he was ""continuing to call on the UK government to support the lowest paid in our communities"". 
He added: ""The Scottish government has put in about £3bn worth of support for low paid families and we would call on the UK government to do something similar.
""VAT is a reserved matter for the UK government and we've asked they consider options there to be able to support businesses at this difficult time.""
Mr McKee said the Scottish government had put ""significant support"" into the business rates system to help businesses through the pandemic. 
On the calls for more support for the hospitality sector, a Treasury spokesman said the UK government had ""stood behind the hospitality sector throughout the pandemic with a £400bn package of economy-wide support that saved millions of jobs and offered a lifeline to thousands of night-time businesses up and down the country.""
He added: ""At the Spring Statement we went further, announcing a £1,000 increase to the Employment Allowance which will cut taxes for thousands of bars, clubs and venues in Scotland."" "	/news/uk-scotland-62434365

entertainment	Ed Sheeran must face copyright trial over Thinking Out Loud, judge rules	"Pop star Ed Sheeran has been ordered to stand trial in the US over claims he copied his hit song Thinking Out Loud from Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On.
A judge denied Sheeran's bid to dismiss the case, saying a jury should decide on the similarities between the songs.
move comes six months after Sheeran was cleared of copying his hit song Shape Of You at a trial in London.
After that ruling, the singer hit out at ""baseless"" copyright claims, which he said were ""way too common"".
m over Thinking Out Loud was originally lodged in 2018, not by Gaye's family but by investment banker David Pullman and a company called Structured Asset Sales, which has acquired a portion of the estate of Let's Get It On co-writer Ed Townsend.
Seeking $100m (£90m) in damages, they allege that Sheeran and his co-writer Amy Wadge ""copied and exploited, without authorisation or credit"" the Gaye song, ""including but not limited to the melody, rhythms, harmonies, drums, bass line, backing chorus, tempo, syncopation and looping"".
On Thursday, US District Judge Louis Stanton cited a disagreement between musical experts on both sides of the lawsuit as a reason for ordering the civil trial.
WATCH: Ed Sheeran sits down for exclusive interview about Shape Of You copyright lawsuit
rospect of a jury trial will be an unwelcome one for Sheeran. Copyright lawyers have often argued that juries have difficulty understanding the complexities of copyright law, and why superficial similarities between two songs are not necessarily proof of plagiarism.
In his order, Judge Stanton also ruled that jurors must decide whether SAS can include concert revenue in damages, rejecting Sheeran's argument that ticket sales weren't tied to the alleged infringement.
Sheeran's 2014-2015 tour earned $150m (£135m), according to music industry trade publication Pollstar.
His lawyers did not comment on the judge's ruling. A lawyer for Structured Asset Sales, Hillel Parness, told Reuters the company was ""pleased"" with the ruling.
rial Sheeran is facing over Thinking Out Loud, which went to number one in the UK in 2014 and won song of the year at the Grammy Awards in 2016.
SAS has filed a second case, which is currently on pause, while a separate suit by another portion of Townsend's estate is awaiting trial.
At the Shape of You a trial in March, the singer and his co-writers John McDaid and Steven McCutcheon faced accusations that a hook on their track ripped off Oh Why, a 2015 song by Sami Chokri and Ross O'Donoghue.
However, a High Court judge concluded they had ""neither deliberately nor subconsciously"" plagiarised the earlier song, and awarded the star and his co-defendants £900,000 in costs.
Afterwards, Sheeran declared on Instagram: ""I hope that this ruling means in the future baseless claims like this can be avoided. This really does have to end.""
He added: ""It's really damaging to the songwriting industry. There's only so many notes and very few chords used in pop music. Coincidence is bound to happen if 60,000 songs are being released every day on Spotify. That's 22 million songs a year, and there's only 12 notes that are available."""	/news/entertainment-arts-63087419

Defending champion and GB compatriot Lucy Charles-Barclay was fourth.
70.3-mile race is a half-distance Ironman event with the full 140.6-mile event taking place in Hawaii earlier this month.
Knibb completed the race in four hours, three minutes and 20 seconds as Canada's Paula Findlay finished second.
24-year-old Olympic mixed triathlon relay gold medallist, who finished more than five minutes ahead of the rest of the field, said: ""I can't really believe it. I'm just grateful that I could execute a good swim, bike, and run. That last 10k was very very long, I can't believe I made it.""

Charles-Barclay, who finished runner-up in the first women-only professional race at the Ironman World Championship in Hawaii two weeks ago, led the pack in the 1.2 mile swim but Knibb overtook her after two miles of the 56 mile cycle.
Having won the event last year Charles-Barclay could not manage a podium place this time, finishing in four hours, 11 minutes and 24 seconds, 39 seconds behind compatriot Pallant-Browne.
Pallant-Browne, 33, moved from sixth to third on the 13.1 mile run, passing Charles-Barclay and Olympic triathlon gold medallist Flora Duffy in an impressive battle for third.
She was not part of the three-strong pack of Charles-Barclay, Findlay and Duffy chasing Knibb on the bike but produced one of the fastest runs of the day to secure a second World Championship podium.

entertainment	Nandi Bushell releases debut single written to 'cheer up Dad'	"A schoolgirl who has performed with some of the world's biggest rock stars has released a new single inspired by her dad's health struggles.
Nandi Bushell, 12, of Ipswich, Suffolk, has bookended this month by drumming at the Foo Fighters' Taylor Hawkins memorial gig and launching her track. 
multi-instrumentalist has also won the attention of Barack Obama and tech giant Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
Nandi said: ""I wrote a song to cheer [my dad] up.""
mpanying video to The Shadows, released on 30 September, charts Nandi's journey from toying around with instruments in her former South African home as a toddler to playing guitars and drums with her dad, with current studio footage of her playing a grand piano.
Quick Q&A with drumming star Nandi Bushell
""The single is about how my dad went through depression... because his auto-immune disease was worsening,"" said Nandi. 
""He told me and he was really upset so I made a song about it.""
Mr Bushell said he felt Nandi's song had ""genuinely helped him"" and hoped it would have the same impact on other people.
""I was having flare-ups all over my body and I was feeling really, really terrible,"" he said.
""Nandi was asking me questions and I was describing how I felt trapped in the bed and in my room, and she said how she wanted to do something to cheer me up. I said all my rainbows felt like they were turning to black. 
""She said, 'Let me put these words into the song,' and finished it by saying, 'I'll be there for you'. I thought this is incredible, [it was] such a beautiful moment.""
r hope the track will reach a wide audience, fuelled in part by Nandi's 2.5m social media followers, a forthcoming appearance on children's TV programme Blue Peter this Monday and her meeting this week with Apple chief Mr Cook.
Her profile has been boosted following a string of extraordinary events including performing with Lenny Kravitz, appearing on US talk show Ellen and writing a song in 2021 with ex-Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello and his son Roman, which former US President Barack Obama posted on his Facebook page.
However, it is her enduring link-up with Foo Fighters that has continued to make headlines after she challenged frontman Dave Grohl to a drum battle during one of the coronavirus lockdowns. It led him to write Nandi a song and he invited her to perform with them at The Forum in Los Angeles last year.
It was there that the band's drummer Taylor Hawkins, who died aged 50 earlier this year, gave the young prodigy his drumsticks.
Poignantly, Nandi used them during her performance for Learn to Fly at his Wembley Stadium tribute gig.
""There was this balcony where I could see the gig happening - it was emotional,"" said Nandi.
She said appearing at both gigs, along with playing at the Queen's Platinum Jubilee concert where she cried after meeting her hero Stephen Fry, had been the highlights of her life so far.
But for now her sights are set on her single release and her forthcoming EP, Into The Abyss, released later this year.
""If one person who is going through a difficult time listens to that song and decides to reach out for help, then that is a measure of success,"" said Mr Bushell.

technology	NHS IT supplier held to ransom by hackers	"A cyber-attack on a major IT provider of the NHS has been confirmed as a ransomware attack.
Advanced, which provides digital services like patient check-in and NHS 111, says it may take three to four weeks to fully recover.
Ransomware hackers take control of IT systems, steal data and demand a payment from victims to recover.
NHS insists that disruption is minimal, but Advanced would not say whether NHS data had been stolen.
Birmingham-based firm says it first spotted the hack at 07:00 BST on 4 August and immediately took steps to contain the hackers. It is now working to restore services.
mpany refused to say if it was in negotiations with hackers or paying a ransom to them. 
In a statement, it said: ""We are rebuilding and restoring impacted systems in a separate and secure environment.""
Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work?
An NHS England spokesperson said: ""While Advanced has confirmed that the incident impacting their software is ransomware, the NHS has tried and tested contingency plans in place including robust defences to protect our own networks, as we work with the National Cyber Security Centre to fully understand the impact. 
""The public should continue to use NHS services as normal, including NHS 111 for those who are unwell, although some people will face longer waits than usual.
""As ever, if it is an emergency, please call 999.""
An NHS psychiatrist, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC the attack left his team ""making clinical decisions nearly blind"".
""If a new patient came to us, we weren't able to read their history or know very much about them,"" he said.
""The [local] trust are doing their best at setting up an alternative system, they've got a way that we can look at some historical notes now, and have set up another system to mean that we can input new notes.
""But there's still basically a week's worth of notes that we can't access. We've been told to be ready for it to not be up and running for who knows how long.""
At the end of last week, family doctors in London were warned by NHS England they could see an increased number of patients sent to them by NHS 111 because of the ""significant technical issue"", industry magazine Pulse reported.
Advanced initially said that only a ""small number of servers"" had been affected and that it might be able to recover in a week.
Products which have been affected include Adastra, which is used by NHS 111 service, and Caresys and Carenotes, which provide the backbone for care home services like patient notes and visitor booking. 
National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ, says it is working with Advanced to help it recover.
A spokesman said: ""Ransomware is the key cyber-threat facing the UK, and all organisations should take immediate steps to limit risk by following our advice on how to put in place robust defences to protect their networks.""
Ransomware hackers are usually financially motivated and part of large, professionally run criminal gangs that target companies and demand hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions, of pounds in ransom in the form of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
While it is hard to trace where the gangs are based, analysis suggests that 74% of all money made through ransomware attacks in 2021 went to Russia-linked hackers."	/news/technology-62506039
technology	What is behind the big tech companies' job cuts?	"first sign of job cuts at Amazon came from LinkedIn posts from laid-off employees.
, Amazon's devices boss, Dave Limp, announced: ""It pains me... We will lose talented Amazonians from the devices & services org"".
Across the tech industry, at firms like Twitter, Meta, Coinbase and Snap, workers have announced they are ""seeking new opportunities"".
Worldwide, more than 120,000 jobs have been lost, according to the Layoffs.fyi website, which tracks tech job cuts.
Different firms cut employees for different reasons but there are common themes.
As our lives moved online during the pandemic, the tech giants' businesses boomed, and executives believed the good times - for them - would continue to roll.
Meta, for example, took on more than 15,000 people in the first nine months of this year.
Now executives announcing cuts have said they miscalculated.
""I made the decision to significantly increase our investments,"" chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told Meta employees, as he laid off 13% of them.
""Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.""
Online adverts are the chief source of income for many tech firms, but for the advertising business, dark clouds have been gathering. Firms have faced growing opposition to intrusive advertising practices. For example, Apple made it harder to track people's online activity and sell that data to advertisers. 
And as the economy ran into trouble, many firms slashed their online advertising budgets.
In the financial technology sector, rising interest rates have also hit companies.
""It's been a really a disappointing quarter of earnings for many of the big tech companies,"" said technology analyst Paolo Pescatore of PP Foresight. ""No-one's immune.""
Even Apple has signalled caution, with chief executive Tim Cook saying the firm was ""still hiring"", but only on a ""deliberate basis."" 
Amazon attributed its job cuts to an ""unusual and uncertain macroeconomic environment"" forcing it to prioritize on what mattered most to customers.
""As part of our annual operating planning review process, we always look at each of our businesses and what we believe we should change,"" spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said. 
""As we've gone through this, given the current macro-economic environment (as well as several years of rapid hiring), some teams are making adjustments, which in some cases means certain roles are no longer necessary. We don't take these decisions lightly, and we are working to support any employees who may be affected.""
Investors have also piled on the pressure to cut costs, accusing firms of being bloated and slow to respond to signs of slowdown.
In an open letter to Alphabet, parent company of Google and YouTube, activist investor Sir Christopher Hohn urged the firm to slash jobs and pay.
Alphabet had to be more disciplined about costs, he wrote, and cut losses from projects like its self-driving car company, Waymo.
Elon Musk is certainly of the view that there is room to cut costs at his latest investment, Twitter, which has struggled to either turn a profit or attract new users.
Added to that, many commentators argue Mr Musk paid over the odds for the firm, and the pressure is on to make his investment worthwhile.
He laid off half the firm's employees; and for those who remain an ""extreme"" work ethic is promised.
According to US media reports on Tuesday, Mr Musk told staff they needed to commit to a ""hardcore"" culture of ""long hours at high intensity"" or leave. 
Industry watcher Scott Kessler also says there is less tolerance for big spending on high-tech gambles like virtual reality or driverless cars that may not pay off in the short term.
Investors also see the high wages and cushy perks some enjoy in the industry as unsustainable.
""Some companies have had to face harsh realities,"" he said.
Mike Morini, from WorkForce Software, which provides digital management tools said it appeared to be a turning point.
""The tech industry is exiting a period of growth at all costs,"" he said.
But while the big tech firms may be buffeted by economic headwinds, they are not broken.
Amazon's proposed 10,000 job cuts in corporate and technology roles - its biggest such reduction to date - represents only 3% of its office staff.
And the lay-offs may also be the start of new businesses as talented staff, dumped by the big firms, join or create start-ups.
As veteran Silicon Valley watcher Mike Malone recently told the BBC: ""I won't write the Valley off yet. I still have a lot of hope."""	/news/technology-63635821
business	Union rejects Rolls-Royce £2,000 living-cost bonus	"A union representing Rolls-Royce workers has rejected the offer of a £2,000 one-off payment from the firm to help its staff with the rising cost of living.
Of the 14,000 staff at Rolls-Royce who were eligible for the payment, 11,000 members are unionised.
Unite said the offer ""falls far short of the real cost of living challenges which our members are experiencing"". 
But Rolls-Royce said the offer was ""fair"" and ""a good deal"" for staff.
ump sum, which was intended for junior management and shop floor staff, was due to begin being rolled out in August, starting with the 3,000 non-unionised staff before being paid to the remaining 11,000 unionised workers.
Unite's regional secretary Paresh Patel said the union was still in negotiations with Rolls-Royce about the pay offer.
News of the offer emerged on Monday night, and was later confirmed by Rolls-Royce.
However, Unite said: ""The fact that Rolls-Royce has made this announcement in the way that it has certainly in our view undermines the trade union and the negotiating position that should be between the employer and the unions on this matter.""
Rolls-Royce had also offered workers a 4% increase in pay, back-dated to March. A Rolls-Royce spokesperson had told the BBC it would be ""the highest annual pay rise for at least a decade"" for its shop floor staff. 
But Unite said it would also reject that offer of a 4% pay rise.
re are ongoing discussions with unions about a pay settlement for 2022-2023, Rolls-Royce's spokesperson said, and the cost of living issue is to be a factor in those negotiations.
In response to Unite's rejection of the offer, the spokesperson said: ""This is a good deal for our colleagues that is fair and competitive, with an immediate cash lump sum to help them through the current exceptional economic climate. 
""We will continue to talk to our people.""
Meanwhile, around 115,000 Royal Mail workers are voting on strike action in a similar row over pay.
Communication Workers Union (CWU), which represents many Royal Mail staff, said it would be claiming for an ""inflation-based, no-strings pay award"", adding that Royal Mail's offer of a 2% pay award was ""miles away from where inflation is, totally inadequate"". 
Pay rates and measures to help UK staff have been increasing as businesses have been seeking to recruit and retain staff, after official figures showed there were fewer unemployed people than job vacancies for the first time since records began. 
Earlier this month, Lloyds Bank staff were offered a £1,000 lump sum to help with rising costs, after Unite the Union demonstrated outside its annual general meeting.
Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - currently stands at 9%, and is expected to increase again later this year.
It seems one-off cost of living payments are gaining in popularity among employers - but are they a short-term fix to a long-term issue?
ure of inflation means that while the rate of price rises may slow next year, it is extremely unlikely that the cost of living will actually drop. Prices are almost certainly not going to fall.
Yet, these payments are not embedded in future wages, unlike a regular pay increase. As employees continue to find it tough, will there be pressure on bosses to make these payments a permanent part of pay next year and beyond?
re is undoubtedly an awareness among businesses that workers, particularly the lower-paid, need more financial help at the moment to cover their bills.
But perhaps this eye-catching tactic of one-off payments is directed more at another issue - the retention and recruitment of staff.
Rolls-Royce was badly impacted by the global coronavirus pandemic, which hit demand for its aircraft engines as international air travel ground to a halt. 
In 2020 it announced plans to cut its global workforce by 9,000 by the end of this year, with 3,000 of those jobs going in the UK. At the time it said it would take ""several years"" for the industry to recover from the pandemic. 
In the first year of Covid, Rolls-Royce made a loss of £4bn because of the collapse in air travel, however it returned to profit in 2021.
Staff shortages are also putting pressure on firms to raise wages.
Earlier this month, Morrisons said it would increase pay for its store workers as UK supermarkets battle for staff in the face of increasing competition in the sector.
Rival chains Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda have also announced pay rises for their workers this year."	/news/business-61874786
health	RSV: Children's clinic extends hours to cut hospital admissions	"A clinic which treats children and babies with respiratory issues has extended its hours to try and ease pressure on hospital admissions.
York's Children's Ambulatory Treatment (CAT) Hub will now open five days a week, up from two.
rincipal cause for child hospital stays is winter bug Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV).
Nationally, almost 30,000 hospital admissions come as a result of the virus each year.
Dr Daniel Kimberling said the hub, which treats under 12s with all respiratory illnesses, was ramping up operations after seeing a rise in cases of children attending hospital.
""We want to be ready for winter,"" the medical director added.
Sources: UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), NHS, House of Lords Library
Dr Brown said the service, which includes experienced children's nurses working alongside a GP, was able to spend more time with children and their parents.
""In a GP surgery you might have 15 minutes,"" she said.
""You've not got the time to sit down with parents and explore all of their worries and provide that education about what they can do at home.""
Children are referred to the clinic by GPs or other health professionals and are monitored for two hours, enabling decisions to be made about what care or treatment is needed.
Libby, who had taken her daughter to the clinic, said it was much easier to access and be reassured about her daughter's health than go to hospital.
""We'd normally have to go to A&E and spend about six hours to get the same treatment, just for one tiny bit of medication.""
UK's health regulator recently approved a new treatment for RSV.
gle antibody shot helps stop infants getting chest infections, such as pneumonia, for about six months.
A large study has now begun to find out whether nirsevimab should be offered to all babies in the UK.
Other treatments for RSV already exist and trials of a vaccine have also shown promise.

politics	Mothers in Cambridge start campaign to support congestion charge	"A group of mothers have gathered together to support a controversial traffic scheme which could see a Cambridge congestion charge brought in.
Greater Cambridge Partnership (GCP) is proposing a £5 charge to be introduced by 2026-27.
But it has sparked opposition from shopkeepers who fear it will hit trade.
Elisabeth Whitebread, from Parents for the Cambridge Sustainable Travel Zone, said it was fair that drivers pay for the pollution their car's produce.
group is holding a protest meeting at Parker's Piece in Cambridge city centre on Saturday, which was also the site of a demonstration against the charging plans in November.
rge would affect private vehicles across the whole city, including Addenbrooke's Hospital and the rest of the BioMedical Campus, between 07:00 and 19:00 on weekdays.
would also see £50m of investment to expand the bus network and improved walking and cycling routes.
Cambridgeshire County Council would have final approval of any plans.
Ms Whitebread told BBC Politics East: ""Cambridge is great place to raise children, but we need a transport system fit for the 21st Century.
""There are no easy answers to this sort of thing, and of cause the charges are going to come in, in a staggered way. There will be upfront investment before the charge comes in. 
""I do think it is fair that people who are driving and causing pollution and congestion are the ones who should pay for it. The council has signed up to a climate emergency so it is really time for them to 'walk the walk.'""
Elissa Meschini, Labour councillor and chair of the Greater Cambridge Partnership which is looking to put forward the plans, said:  ""We have to come clean about the challenges we face. All we ask at this point is that people appreciate the extent of the challenge we have to address. We haven't made a final decision and it's important people understand it isn't an easy solution.""
GCP said the scheme would cut the number of car trips in Cambridge by 50% .
John Whitelegg, a visiting professor at Liverpool John Moores University who has studied congestion charge schemes, said: ""I'm surprised to hear the 50% figure. 
""I think that might prove to be wildly out of line with the outcome.""
But Prof Whitelegg, who is a former Green Party spokesperson in sustainable transport, believed congestion charge schemes are the way forward, and people who originally oppose it will come around to supporting it in the end.
""There's a pattern. There is initial opposition, then reluctantly accepting the scheme is being done, and then really liking it and everyone finding the advantages of it,"" he said.
But the plans have provoked strong opposition.
Clare King, 64, who has lived in Cambridge for 30 years and drives across the city every day for her job in a supermarket, said: ""Rather than the 10 minute car journey, I would need to walk to a bus stop, wait for a bus, catch two buses, then get off a bus near work and then walk to work. 
""That journey would take me between 45 and 50 minutes, provided the buses came pretty quickly.
""We need to improve the buses. We don't need to do it through treating residents as cash cows.""

politics	Prince of Wales has no plans for investiture, Kensington Palace confirms	"Prince of Wales has no plans for an investiture, Kensington Palace has said.
William made his first visit on Wednesday to the Welsh Parliament since his father made him Prince of Wales.
King's decision triggered a debate about whether or not there should be a repeat of Charles' 1969 investiture in Caernarfon.
While there was support for that event at the time, it also faced protests.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said it ""easy to see"" why a different approach was being taken ""during tough times"".
Meanwhile the prince said he is supporting both England and Wales at the World Cup, following controversy over his support for the former.
Deputy presiding officer David Rees said William accepted a Welsh bucket hat during the visit.
William met the First Minister Mark Drakeford, Presiding Officer Elin Jones and party leaders.
He arrived at the Senedd by car and entered through a side-entrance for the meeting in Cardiff, which is free of the pomp or crowds of recent royal events in the capital.
Prince of Wales was given his title by the new King the day following the death of Queen Elizabeth II.
It was William's second official visit to the country as Prince of Wales, after he and the Princess of Wales visited Anglesey and Swansea in September.
role of Prince of Wales has faced criticism - the Plaid Cymru Senedd group said the title of has ""no formal place or responsibility within Welsh life"", following their meeting with the royal.
But the visit was welcomed by the Welsh Conservatives.
Kensington Palace said the meeting aimed to ""deepen his understand of the issues and opportunities of greatest importance to the Welsh people"".
BBC Wales was told that the prince understands he is at the start of a long period of association with Wales' political system, and was keen to express his desire to deepen the trust and respect of people of Wales over time.
He planned to tell them that there are no formal plans for an investiture ceremony, aware of the political controversy that surrounded the event in 1969.
Kensington Palace said an investiture is ""not on the table"".
ure ceremony for the then-Prince of Wales took place in Caernarfon Castle in 1969
On Wednesday the prince was given a brief tour of the Senedd building and debating chamber led by the Llywydd, Elin Jones.
He met politicians from the four parties represented in the Senedd - Welsh Labour, the Welsh Conservatives, Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Liberal Democrats.
William concluded his visit by meeting the Welsh Youth Parliament.
meeting follows controversy about his support for the English football team, ahead of the World Cup.
On Tuesday evening, Welsh actor Michael Sheen questioned whether William's role as Prince of Wales was appropriate given his support of the England football team.
Rhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru MS, said on Twitter: ""He's an Englishman, so of course he supports England,"" but added: ""I'm clear there shouldn't be a Prince of Wales. But this football thing must be embarrassing for him too. Just highlights the nonsense.""
After Elin Jones raised the World Cup group match between Wales and England, he said: ""I'm telling everyone I'm supporting both, definitely. I can't lose.
""I've supported England since I've been quite small, but I support Welsh rugby and that's my kind of way of doing it.
""I happily support Wales over England in the rugby.
""I've got to be able to play carefully with my affiliations because I worry otherwise if I suddenly drop England to support Wales then that doesn't look right for the sport either. So I can't do that.""
Prince Charles, as he was then, was 20 when he was crowned at the investiture ceremony at Caernarfon Castle.
While it had no formal constitutional role, the ceremony presented Charles with the symbols that marked him as Prince of Wales: the sword, coronet, ring, rod and mantle.
In addition to the 4000 guests present in the castle, 19 million saw it at home and another 500 million watched around the world.
was watched by a TV audience of millions. Street parties were held across the country, but it polarised opinion in Wales amid a backdrop of protests and bombings.
First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""I think it's a decision for him to make. He will have thought carefully about it. I always believed myself that taking 1969 as a template for Wales in 2022 would not be a reliable guide to the best way to proceed."" 
""In tough times, I think everybody who is in a position of making decisions about how public money is spent, and the sort of messages that it sends to the wider population, will be thinking hard about that and I think it's very easy to see why the prince himself, and those who advise him, will come to the conclusion that a different approach is the right one to take in 2022.""  
King Charles' decision to make William Prince of Wales triggered discussion among some politicians over whether an investiture would be suitable.
But in a Walesonline article, written in October, the presiding officer said investitures ""should be consigned"" to the 20th century.
Plaid Cymru MS Elin Jones, who is among those meeting William on Wednesday, wrote her republicanism remained ""unshaken"" following her involvement in the events marking the death of Queen Elizabeth at the Senedd and at St James' Palace, for the Accession Council.
In September Kensington Palace said there were no plans for Prince William to have an investiture ""anything like his father had"" as Prince of Wales.
Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price were among those who met William on Wednesday.
Mr Davies said it was a ""pleasure to welcome the Prince of Wales"".
He added: ""After the King and Queen's recent visit, it is fantastic to see the bonds between Wales and our Royal Family becoming stronger still. There is a huge amount of goodwill towards the Prince and Princess in Wales, and I know there will always be a warm welcome for them whenever they visit.
A spokesperson on behalf of the Plaid Cymru group said: ""The Plaid Cymru group have been clear that we believe the title of the ""Prince of Wales"" to be antiquated and out of touch with a modern, equal, and democratic Wales.""
""Furthermore, given the exacerbating cost of living crisis and the historical sensitives, an investiture should not take place in any circumstance - nor should any service that could be interpreted as a lesser form of an investiture,"" the group said.
It added: ""We look forward to seeing the Prince use the platform he has already, that isn't necessarily reliant on him being Prince of Wales, to promote good causes and positive change across Wales and the world including tackling child poverty, inequality, and the climate crisis.""
Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds, said: ""It was an honour to welcome His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to the Senedd this morning and I am extremely grateful for him taking the time to have a one-on-one meeting with me.
""It is very clear that His Royal Highness cares deeply about the people of Wales and it was fantastic to hear of his commitment to mental health causes, particularly his interest in mental health provisions for rural areas and farmers."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63635177

Hours after telling the Commons about the policy, BBC political editor Chris Mason asked if that meant the “full backlog”. The prime minister said some people made “late and spurious” claims, and the new laws would end that option.

health	John Radcliffe Hospital: Patients using A&E hits record high	"umber of people being treated or waiting for treatment at a major hospital's A&E department has hit a record high. 
Lily O'Connor, Oxfordshire's urgent care director, said 157 patients were in the John Radcliffe Hospital's emergency department in Oxford on Monday evening. 
She said despite the ""unprecedented"" demand staff had coped well.
But they were working under ""persistent pressure"", she added. 
While she said demand ""fluctuates"" at the county's other hospital, the Horton General in Banbury, staff at the A&E there have regularly been placed ""under significant pressure"" over recent months. 
John Radcliffe has been ""under significant pressure since August"" across all ages, and demand for children's services has got ""particularly bad"" over recent weeks.   
""When we hit 100 [patients] it's pretty tough on everybody because we have got a large volume of people to see at a single point in time and [are] trying to ensure that everyone who needs immediate care gets it. 
""To get 157 in the early evening [on Monday] was unprecedented at the John Radcliffe,"" Ms O'Connor told BBC Radio Oxford.
Care Quality Commission said last month that the health and care system across England is gridlocked because patients cannot access the support they need. 
Its annual report said the problem was resulting in long waits for ambulances and in A&E departments. 
Pete Macgrane, Oxford Health's clinical director for community services, said that trust is also seeing increased demand. 
""Everything that we are doing is trying to make sure that we can support patients where at all possible and where it's clinically the right thing to do to remain within their own homes,"" he said.

business	No plans for windfall tax on electricity producers	"Boris Johnson has no plans to introduce a windfall tax on the profits of electricity firms before he steps down as prime minister, his spokesman said.
government said in May that oil and gas companies would be taxed an additional 25% for the next 12 months to help households with rising bills.
But the PM's spokesman said such a policy wouldn't be extended to electricity producers.
Shares in energy firms Centrica and SSE rose 3% each after the announcement.
government introduced a new tax on energy firms in May, known as the Energy Profits Levy, in a bid to raise around £5bn.
It came after BP and Shell both reported big profit increases as global oil and gas prices surged following increases in demand driven by the relaxing of Covid restrictions around the world, and also because of supply concerns after Russia - a major exporter of fossil fuels - invaded Ukraine.
It is hoped the windfall tax - a one-off tax that is imposed by a government on a company - on UK oil and gas producers could be used to help households seeing rising energy bills bite into budgets.
But asked on Monday whether the windfall tax would be extended to electricity generators, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""We would not seek to make any new policies or major fiscal decisions. 
""So there's no plans to do that.""
kesman said the government would ""continue to evaluate the scale of the profits and consider appropriate steps"", but there was ""no plans to introduce or extend that to that group"".
BBC has contacted the Treasury for comment.
Labour has called on the government to consider ""backdating"" its current Energy Profits Levy to January to raise ""extra tax revenue"" from oil and gas firms.
Shadow Treasury minister James Murray claimed including the extra months could raise an extra £1.9bn, which it urged the government to ""put towards removing VAT on domestic energy bills for the rest of this year"".
mestic energy bills could hit more than £3,300 a year this winter, according to the latest forecasts, having already increased £700 annually in April.
A set of government payments to help with bills starts to be paid next week. The government has said all UK households will receive a £400 discount on their fuel bills, while people on benefits will get an additional £650.
But Labour's Mr Murray said a total of £200m of public money would go towards people with multiple properties as the energy support package for households was ""cobbled together"" at the last minute.
""That is not fair. That is not a good use of public money,"" he added.
windfall tax could also hit electricity generators, including renewable energy operators, was first reported by the Financial Times.
Sources who were close to the Treasury - as they considered how to impose a windfall tax on such producers - pointed out that renewable and nuclear energy generators have also enjoyed bumper profits as electricity prices surged. They also enjoyed extra profits as they are not dependent on expensive gas to produce power.
But energy firms warned that an attempt to extend a windfall tax to renewable energy could destroy investor confidence ahead of key auctions for licences to develop new wind and solar projects.
f one of the UK's biggest investors in renewables previously said his profits from renewable energy generation were in the low hundreds of millions for a whole year, compared to the £7bn made by Shell and the £5bn made by BP in the first three months of 2021 alone."	/news/business-62121228

entertainment	Gary Lineker tweet broke impartiality rules, says BBC complaints unit	"Gary Lineker broke BBC impartiality rules in a tweet about the Conservative Party, the corporation has ruled.
In February, the Match of the Day host posted a story about then-Foreign Secretary Liz Truss urging a boycott of the Champions League final in Russia.
He added: ""And her party will hand back their donations from Russian donors?""
BBC's Executive Complaints Unit (ECU) has upheld a complaint and said Lineker's post ""did not meet the BBC's editorial standards on impartiality"".
former England striker declined to comment on the decision.
ECU said Lineker was ""one of the BBC's highest profile stars"" and, although not required to uphold the same high standards of impartiality as the broadcaster's journalists, does have an ""additional responsibility"" because of his profile.
""We expect these individuals to avoid taking sides on party political issues or political controversies and to take care when addressing public policy matters,"" the ruling said.
It explained that Lineker had pointed out that the tweet was prompted by an article about football, his primary area of expertise, and the board accepted it was intended as a comment on the sport rather than politics.
BBC Sport managers also pointed out that he framed his tweet in the form of a question, rather than a statement of opinion on a politically controversial matter.
However, the ECU concluded that the post was intended to highlight a ""perceived inconsistency in the Conservative Party's approach, at a time when relations between the UK and Russia were the subject of significant public debate"".
Lineker's tweet came as Russia began its invasion of Ukraine, and just before European footballing body Uefa moved the Champions League final from St Petersburg to Paris as a result.
ECU said its ruling had been discussed with Lineker and BBC Sport managers. "	/news/entertainment-arts-63248314

Some users online have questioned the accelerated opening-up - ""The medical system will be overwhelmed and many elderly would be infected. It [a major wave of infections] begins now,"" one user wrote.
But many others rejoiced at the loosening of a policy that had controlled their lives for nearly three years.
Until now, China had forced people with Covid and anyone who was a close contact to go to quarantine camps. 
unpopular because it separated families and removed people from their homes. Some of the centres were also reported to have poor living conditions and inadequate staff.

untry's vice-premier, Sun Chunlan, flagged last week that China was entering ""a new situation""  in the pandemic and said the virus's ability to cause disease was weakening. 
Experts have warned any easing of zero-Covid in China would have to be done slowly - as the country of 1.4 billion people could see a huge jump in cases that could overwhelm its healthcare system.
Speeding up vaccination of its elderly population is key, health experts say.

business	Investment cuts could threaten levelling up, warns infrastructure tsar	"government's targets for ""levelling up"" and ""net zero"" are at risk if too much investment spending is cut in the Autumn Statement, its top adviser on infrastructure has warned.
f the National Infrastructure Commission told the BBC it was crucial the government stuck to its policies.
Sir John Armitt said cutting back on the HS2 rail route would be ""silly"".
Last week, the government confirmed that much infrastructure spending was under review.
On Thursday, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt will unveil his Autumn Statement - a Budget in all but name - and he has already said that he faces decisions of ""eye-watering difficulty"".  
Speaking to the BBC, Sir John said: ""Clearly we're in a very difficult situation. The chancellor has real challenges and therefore one can understand there might be some pressure on infrastructure.
""On the other hand infrastructure is seen as being the economic driver for many parts of the country, particularly those parts of the country which are looking to level up.
""It's so important that government doesn't flip flop, it sticks to its ambition, it sticks to its policies, so that the private sector will bring in a lot of capital, which creates jobs and opportunity. 
""To cut back on HS2 would be frankly very silly,"" he added. ""I think you've got massive investment, which has happened in Birmingham ahead of HS2 - it just shows what can happen. And Manchester of course equally is now seeing investment off the back of HS2. I think that would be a very strange decision."" 
He said that scheme and the Integrated Rail Review were ""very important for levelling up"".
Some economists anticipate that the government will squeeze investment spending on Thursday because in history it has been seen as the easiest ""big ticket"" spending item for the Treasury to delay.
re has also been a relative boost to investment spending at the very beginning of this Parliament under the initial premiership of Boris Johnson up to above £70bn a year in public sector net investment.
But Sir John disputed the idea there had been an infrastructure boom, saying: ""If you look at the numbers, there's been a decrease in investment in the last couple of years, not a ramp up. There's been talk of a ramp up and that's why it's important to maintain that belief that there needs to be a ramp up.""
With COP27 climate talks still ongoing, Sir John also expressed concern about the delivery of investment required to hit net zero targets for carbon emissions, saying the UK risked falling behind other countries.
""If everybody stuck to the policies, we'd get to net zero. The actual delivery is where we're falling down. So we can't afford to take our foot off the pedal, we've got to keep going, otherwise we will not get to net zero."""	/news/business-63624768
entertainment	The birth pangs of the Grand Theft Auto franchise	"Grand Theft Auto franchise has been a phenomenal success since it was first launched exactly 25 years ago, making billions of dollars for its American owner Take-Two Interactive.
So it may come as a surprise to learn that its creators, Dundee-based DMA Design, were far from confident about GTA's prospects as they struggled with creative and technical problems during its development in the 1990s.
Colin Macdonald, who joined DMA a few months before the launch of the action-adventure video game in 1997, explains: ""In mid-development, there was an informal staff survey on which of the seven titles they were working on would be the most successful and least successful. 
""The one voted most likely not to succeed was Grand Theft Auto.
""That's because, mid-development, the direction of the game wasn't clear. It was also quite buggy - you couldn't play it for more than a couple of minutes without it crashing, so certainly at grassroots level there wasn't a lot of confidence in it."" 
Colin, who was to become the producer of GTA 2 and later Channel 4's first games commissioning editor, says the atmosphere at DMA was ""quite relaxed"" by the time he joined.
""GTA went through a lot of different iterations and was quite a troubled development, and wasn't really regarded well for most of the time it was in production.
""By the time I joined it was pretty much done and the team was actually quite happy because they had kind of got shot of it.
""They were looking forward to sitting back, planning a sequel properly, redoing the things that they weren't happy with, and just looking forward to getting stuck into iterating on it and seeing where else they could take it.""
Fans of GTA may also be surprised to learn that the franchise actually stemmed from a technology experiment - with a dinosaur as its central character.
Colin explains: ""One of the original founding programmers at DMA, Mike Dailly, was basically doing a tech experiment as a way of showing how buildings could look in 3D from top down with a little bit of perspective.
""So he basically came up with a dinosaur game. You had this city that moved around in some form of 3D, but you were a dinosaur roaming around and destroying the buildings. That was what Grand Theft Auto started as.
""He then added in little cars driving around, just to bring the city to life. 
""Someone had the bright idea to see what it would be like driving one of the cars rather than controlling the dinosaur and suddenly it changed into a car game, rather than a dinosaur game. 
""It was called Race 'n' Chase for a good while. And then someone realised, 'oh, actually we'll try letting the player get out of the car and run around and jump in and out of other cars'. 
""It was really only at that point it morphed into Grand Theft Auto."" 
Overhauling the original idea brought its own problems, according to Colin.
""When you are changing a game so fundamentally like that, all sorts of problems get introduced.
""You have developed code that is no longer doing what it was originally intended to do. So there's all sorts of problems - the game gets very buggy and crashes a lot, and the team are feeling like the whole process is completely changing and they are not doing what they originally set out to do. 
""But actually, this process of evolving and iterating is what made it feel so dynamic. 
""So although it was a very frustrating process for the team, it meant they could see what really worked, iterate on it and give the game a new direction.
""They also had time to polish it, so they started doing things like adding skid marks and shadows and nice sound effects and the radio stations - all of those things that really brought the world to life.""
Colin says that although GTA only came together in its final six months of development, there were signs that it could connect with a wide audience.
""The team were playing it in their own lunchtimes, which is always a rare thing. 
""After you spend a couple of years developing something, you are usually sick to the back teeth of seeing it - the last thing you want to do is see it again in your spare time."" 
Colin says the sequel he produced involved making technical changes to make the game more ""structurally sound"" and moving the game from being set in the contemporary world. 
""We wanted to make it feel a little bit more futuristic. That gave us more creative licence with the vehicles, with the weapons, with the types of environments you would see. 
""In hindsight, that probably hasn't resonated with audiences as well as the contemporary vehicles and cities. Most of the Grand Theft Auto games have gone back to being set more or less in the present day.""
Colin adds that despite the franchise's birth pangs, there was a sense within the original team that they were on to something.
""We knew we had something special - the fact that the team were playing it in their own time is a really strong indicator of that - but there are countless games that come out every year that are creatively and technically brilliant but just don't sell particularly well, for whatever reason. 
""Most people don't hear about them - they are not quite capturing the zeitgeist of the moment - and Grand Theft Auto could easily have been another one of those.
""It's been quite a surprise to see it still do so well a quarter of a century later.""

politics	Tory MPs say they will continue naming asylum hotels	"Some Tory MPs have vowed not to be ""silenced"", after a refugee charity called for politicians to stop naming hotels housing people seeking asylum.
Refugee Council has written to the Commons Speaker urging him to ask MPs not to identify hotels to protect the safety of those staying there.
But several Tories said they would still ""name and shame"" hotels getting taxpayer money to house migrants.
UK spends almost £7m a day on hotels for asylum seekers and refugees.
Last month an immigration processing centre in Dover, Kent, was firebombed in an attack police have said was motivated by extreme right-wing terrorist ideology. 
In the Refugee Council letter, first reported by the Guardian, the charity's chief executive Enver Soloman said the ""horrific"" incident highlighted how asylum seekers were vulnerable to violent attacks by extremists. 
""It has been Home Office practice to not publicly name hotels where people are staying in order to guard their safety and privacy, but we know that increasingly MPs are naming specific premises when they raise this issue,"" he wrote. 
""It is of course right that MPs should be able to raise any constituency issue in Parliament, but this can be done without identifying a specific hotel and potentially making it more vulnerable to attack.""
Campaign group Hope Not Hate said it had recorded 182 visits from anti-immigration activists to migrant accommodation sites so far this year, some of which involved asylum seekers and security staff being harassed and filmed. 
However, Tory MP Lee Anderson, who represents Ashfield, wrote on Facebook: ""Like many of you, I am sick and tired of seeing our hospitality abused and people who are simply economic migrants cheating our system via small boats and dodgy human rights legislation.
""I will not be silenced and will name and shame these greedy hotel owners.""
Brendan Clarke-Smith, Tory MP for Bassetlaw, said he would always be ""welcoming to those in genuine need"" but posted a similar message, saying: ""I will not be silenced and will use the privileges given to me as a Member of Parliament to continue to speak out on this issue.""
Former Conservative minister David Davis has also raised concerns about plans to house asylum seekers at a specific hotel in his constituency of Haltemprice and Howden, as well as another which is already being used for the purpose. 
In response to the Refugee Council letter, he told the BBC: ""In most cases, and in most constituencies, the housing arrangements of migrants are hardly a secret.
""It is normally the case that hotels, or other facilities, housing migrants or asylum seekers [are] well known so I cannot see any strength in calls to restrict the freedom of speech of Members of Parliament in this matter.""
He added: ""It is particularly important for MPs to speak out about the housing of migrants in their constituency when it directly relates to the provision of services on which our constituents and the migrants rely such as healthcare and education.""
Labour MP Dame Diana Johnson, who chairs the Commons home affairs committee, said there was ""little to be gained from publicising the exact hotels"" asylum seekers were staying in, which she said could put them ""at greater risk"". 
A spokeswoman for Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle declined to comment.
Meanwhile, Home Office Minister Robert Jenrick suggested the government may have to ask rural areas and smaller towns to accommodate more migrants if the number of arrivals remained high. 
government is under pressure to tackle the increasing number of people crossing the Channel in small boats. 
Over the weekend the number of migrants who had made the dangerous journey so far this year passed 40,000 - the highest number since figures began to be collected in 2018.

technology	UK decides AI still cannot patent inventions	"UK's Intellectual Property Office has decided artificial-intelligence systems cannot patent inventions for the time being.
Patents assign the ownership of a new invention to its creator.
A recent IPO consultation found many experts doubted AI was currently able to invent without human assistance.
Current law allowed humans to patent inventions made with AI assistance, the government said, despite ""misperceptions"" this was not the case.
Last year, the Court of Appeal ruled against Stephen Thaler, who had said his Dabus AI system should be recognised as the inventor in two patent applications, for:
judges sided, by a two-to-one majority, with the IPO, which had told him to list a real person as the inventor.
""Only a person can have rights - a machine cannot,"" wrote Lady Justice Laing in her judgement. 
""A patent is a statutory right and it can only be granted to a person.""
But the IPO also said it would ""need to understand how our IP system should protect AI-devised inventions in the future"" and committed to advancing international discussions, with a view to keeping the UK competitive.
In July 2021, in a case also brought by Mr Thaler, an Australian court decided AI systems could be recognised as inventors for patent purposes. 
Days earlier, South Africa had issued a similar ruling. 
However, the Australian decision was later overturned on appeal.
Many AI systems are trained on large amounts of data copied from the internet.
And, on Tuesday, the IPO also announced plans to change copyright law to allow anyone with lawful access - rather than only those conducting non-commercial research, as now - to do this, to ""promote the use of AI technology, and wider 'data mining' techniques, for the public good"".
Rights holders will still be able to control and charge for access to their works but no longer charge extra for the ability to mine them.
An increasing number of people are using AI tools such as DALL.E 2 to create images resembling a work of human art.
And Mr Thaler has recently sued the US Copyright Office over its refusal to recognise a software system as the ""author"" of an image, the Register reported.
In the consultation, the IPO noted the UK was one of only a handful of countries to protect computer-generated works with no human creator. 
""author"" of a ""computer-generated work"" is defined as ""the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are undertaken"", it says. 
And protection lasts for 50 years from when the work is made.
Performing-arts workers' union Equity had called for copyright law to be changed to protect actors' livelihoods from AI content such as ""deepfakes"", generated from images of their face or voice.
IPO took this issue seriously, it said, but ""at this stage, the impacts of AI technologies on performers remain unclear"".
""We will keep these issues under review,"" it added."	/news/technology-61896180
sports	Netball World Cup 2019: What's next for England?	"Record crowds watched Tracey Neville's England win their third successive World Cup bronze medal in Liverpool - but it was not the climax the Roses hoped for.
r third place play-off win came one year and three months after they shocked Australia - the most successful netball nation in the world - to win Commonwealth gold. 
As they leave Liverpool without the world title and with Neville leaving her role as head coach, what's next for this Roses team? 
Neville, 42, announced before the World Cup that she would be standing down to start a family.
former international, the sister of former footballers Phil and Gary Neville, was appointed in 2015, having coached domestic side Manchester Thunder for the previous four years.
She was tasked with turning around the fortunes of an England side who had finished fourth at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
She won two World Cup bronzes during her tenure, while also engineering Quad Series victories over Australia and New Zealand, but will forever be remembered as the coach that guided the team to a first major championship gold. 
So how do you fill those shoes?
England Netball chief executive Joanna Adams says she wants the next national coach to be British. It is understood four-time Superleague-winning coach and ex-England wing attack Tamsin Greenway is one of the front-runners for the job, although Adelaide Thunderbirds' Australian boss Tania Obst is also a leading contender.
""I think it's fine to get someone foreign in if they are the best person for the job but I can't think of anyone that would be better than what we've got here in England,"" said former Roses captain Sara Bayman, a BBC pundit.
""There is going to be such a big rebuilding process, so it's not necessarily about who comes in, but what they can offer.
""Tracey was a personality and did a lot for the image of the sport, but now it is very much about bringing in someone who is a developmental coach. It's a real grey area on what the job is.""
Momentum is key to growing a sport's popularity but there is a bit of a gap in netball's scheduling after the World Cup. The English domestic season does not start until January and the next major international event does not come until 2022 - at the Birmingham Commonwealth Games. 
""We have been building up the sport and we have a really strong Superleague and a quad series that keeps netball on the TV and at the forefront of people's minds,"" said England Netball chief executive Adams.
""We have surpassed Sydney [the 2015 World Cup hosts] in ticket sales and we want mums and daughters to love the sport and I think we have done that.""
m lining up to compete in Birmingham will look considerably different to the one who stepped on the podium on Sunday.
Four Commonwealth champions - defenders Geva Mentor, Eboni Usoro-Brown, centre-courter Jade Clarke and shooter Jo Harten - are all in their 30s, and are unlikely to make another major tournament. 
""Some of those players have been around this team for a long time and it's about whether they want to keep going,"" added Adams. 
""It's a tough sport but there is some great talent coming through. We didn't want the legacy of netball not to continue.""
England not winning gold on home soil could be seen as failure, but given the Roses' defeat by eventual champions New Zealand was their eighth semi-final loss in a row, was it a surprise?
Australian and Kiwis have contested every World Cup final since 1991, with the Diamonds winning 11 titles. 
But their dominance is under threat, according to England mid-courter Sasha Corbin.
""Australia have always been on the top,"" she said. ""No-one's ever seemed to take them on, especially for the past few World Cups. You can see how close netball is at the top level now.""

Four African nations finished in the top eight at the World Cup for the first time this year, and South Africa breaking into the top four shows nations are catching up.
So will it just be Australia challenging for New Zealand's World Cup crown in Cape Town in 2023?
""Everyone's getting closer,"" added Bayman. ""England's Commonwealth Games victory on the Gold Coast last year made other nations believe that they could do it. 
""We've seen South Africa in the top four for the first time in 24 years, we see a new world champion for the first time in 16 years. Things are changing in global netball and it's exciting to see.""

sports	Bellator v Rizin: AJ McKee on his father, being a 'teddy bear' and the Pitbull trilogy	"AJ McKee Jr was about 12 years old when he asked his father what would turn out to be a lifechanging question.
Growing up in California, McKee spent a lot of time with MMA legend Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson and found himself captivated by the former UFC light-heavyweight champion's lifestyle.
""He was a big jokester, a lot like my father - very laid back and a good heart - but you don't wanna see him mad,"" McKee tells BBC Sport.
""We'd sit in a car he'd made into a limo and during camps he'd go into the gym to train while I'd be sat playing video games.
""We'd go to his house and have barbeques, pool parties, and I was like 'Dad, why don't you have this? We need this life. We deserve this.'""
McKee's father Antonio was a successful fighter who ended his career in 2019 with a fine record of 30 wins and six defeats.
Despite his sporting success, he never reached the same level of stardom as Jackson, and this is what confused McKee.
Looking back, McKee points to the difference in fighting style between the athletes.
""Rampage is a knockout artist. It was such a new, fast-growing sport and everyone wants to see the knockouts and the finishes,"" he says. 
""My father was a brute - a very high-evel wrestler - and nobody could stop his takedowns, but at the time that wasn't what people wanted to see.""
McKee says it used to bother his father when he asked why he did not have the same recognition as Jackson, and this is what initially drove him to pursue his own career in the sport.
On Saturday McKee, 27, will headline a cross-promotional event in Japan between Bellator and Rizin, when he faces Roberto de Souza at lightweight.
Former Bellator featherweight champion McKee is arguably the biggest star in the promotion and will be looking to improve his record of 19 wins and one defeat.
""That's where it became kind of personal with me, like 'I'm going to be your revenge in this sport where they have no choice but to recognise our last name in the industry',"" says McKee.
""My dad is my training partner to this day at 52 years old. He's in the gym with me every day so we came up with a style that was entertaining. 
""We know I have the wrestling background, so I can get someone to the ground, but it was trying to implement the striking and give fans the entertainment they needed - the knockouts, the submissions.""
Away from the cage, McKee describes himself as an ""adrenaline junkie"" with a passion for fast cars, shooting and snowboarding, but also a ""big teddy bear, loving and softly spoken"".
His success enables him to embrace aspects of Jackson's life he admired as a youngster, but he takes a more reserved approach, being conscious of the example he sets for his friends and family.
""When you're a provider you take care of your family and everyone around you and you have to be cognitive of your expenses - that's something my dad kind of made me realise early on,"" says McKee.
""He said you can dress a certain way, you can show people with the work you put in this is what they can expect, but if they don't put in the work they can't expect it.""
Following the sole defeat of McKee's career in a rematch with Patricio 'Pitbull' Freire in April when he lost his title, McKee went through a bout of depression.
""When I heard 'unanimous decision', it was like my whole world crumbled in front of me,"" says McKee.
""I wasn't really open to anyone about it, you know? My 16-year-old brother has lived with me for around four years now. I wasn't talking to him about anything but he could tell I was hurt. 
""I was walking through the house and not saying anything, sleeping all day, and I wasn't able to really verbalise it.""
After some self-reflection, McKee opened up to his loved ones and now uses the experience to help others.
""Depression is big right now, post-Covid, and our younger generation took a big impact on their social lives,"" he says.
""My younger cousin and brother have been through it a bit, so going through something like that myself opened my mind up, and being able to express that to other people and let them know you have people there for you, to verbalise it and reach out...
""I know the first step is hard because you feel vulnerable, but I feel that's the key.""
McKee's Bellator rival Freire is fighting in the co-main event on Saturday against Rizin's featherweight champion Kleber Koike.
McKee and Freire have one win each against each other, with McKee winning their first encounter in July last year, and he is targeting a trilogy bout.
""It's only right for his legacy and for my legacy. It's what the fans want and hopefully it's what he wants,"" says McKee. 
""I don't know how he feels about the last fight but I feel the game needs to be settled and see who the best of the best is.
""It's not about the money or the belt any more - it's for the legacy. We can't leave an open door like that."""	/sport/mixed-martial-arts/64110403
health	Labour would not give nurses a 19% pay rise	"Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting has said Labour would not give nurses a 19% pay rise if they were in government, but would hold negotiations with Unison and the Royal College of Nursing. 
Mr Streeting went on to say that the government should be ""biting the hand"" off unions offering to hold talks over NHS pay rises. 
He said it was up to the government to cancel the planned strikes, but in not doing so it was a ""real lack of responsibility and betrayal of patients.
