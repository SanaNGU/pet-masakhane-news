technology	Gamers face price rise on PS5 but not Switch	"Gamers looking to buy a new console face a price rise if they want a Sony PlayStation 5, but not if they choose a Nintendo Switch. 
PS5s will cost an extra £30 in the UK, with EU consoles going up by €50 (£42) and Canadian consoles by CAD $20 (£13).
Sony is increasing its console prices because of inflation, it says, but Nintendo says that despite rising costs, its prices will stay the same.
Meanwhile, PC gamers may soon be able to save money on their hardware.
Jensen Huang, chief executive of tech company Nvidia, said the company had overproduced graphics cards, which have been in short supply in recent years.
""Our strategy is to sell in well below the current sell-through levels in the marketplace to give the channel an opportunity to correct,"" he said, according to the Verge.
uld mean the price of high-end graphics cards, including the RTX 3000 series, and gaming laptops falling.
Despite the increase in cost of the PS5 in many jurisdictions, there will be no price rises in the US.
Piers Harding-Rolls, industry analyst at gaming research firm Ampere Analysis, told the BBC the lack of a price increase in the US was a result of the strength of the dollar.
""Sony is a global entity which is operating I guess more consistently in lots of global markets, so they are impacted by currency exchanges and the strength of the dollar,"" he said.
""And that's why you're seeing price increases in some markets, but not in others - you've got this nuanced approach which is trying to reflect the impact on the costs of goods in relation to those specific markets.""
Jim Ryan, Sony Interactive Entertainment president and chief executive said in a blog post: ""The global economic environment is a challenge that many of you around the world are no doubt experiencing. 
""We're seeing high global inflation rates, as well as adverse currency trends, impacting consumers and creating pressure on many industries."" 
But Mr Harding-Rolls said he did not expect the price increase to put off gaming enthusiasts.
""I think pent-up demand for PS5, even though the availability is not good, means that this price increase won't have a huge impact at all,"" he said. 
""I don't see it changing Sony's outlooks or their sales. I think they're going to sell all the products that they can get into market.""
He added the move could potentially hand an advantage to Microsoft, which makes the Xbox console, ""because it has the cheaper console in the market coupled with Game Pass"".
BBC has approached Microsoft for comment. 
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa told financial newspaper Nikkei: ""In order to offer unique entertainment to a wide range of customers, we want to avoid pricing people out.
""Our competition is the variety of entertainment in the world, and we always think about pricing in terms of the value of the fun we offer."""	/news/technology-62659688
business	Network Rail starts consultation over job reforms	"Network Rail has started a legal consultation with unions on maintenance reforms it says are needed to modernise the rail industry, one of the issues at the centre of the current strikes.
Around 1,900 fewer jobs would be needed under the proposed reforms.
mpany said the plans will also save money that is ""necessary for the future of our railway"". 
But the RMT union, which has staged strikes over pay and reform proposals, criticised the move.
reforms have been a key part of the ongoing dispute with the RMT, and this step represents an attempt to push through the changes whether or not the union agrees.
But negotiations can continue through the consultation process.
Changes to how Network Rail maintenance teams work would see multi-functional teams sent to fix faults on on tracks instead of multiple specialist teams.
A ""raft of labour and life-saving technology"" would also be rolled out.
Network Rail's chief executive Andrew Haines said he hadn't given up on finding a negotiated way forward, but added ""we can't continue to circle the same ground day after day, week after week and not move forward"".
""It is vital that we progress our modernisation plans to help put our railway on a sustainable financial footing for the future,"" he said.
""The way people live and work has changed since the pandemic. On the railway, that means significantly fewer commuters and significantly less income.""
Network Rail said around 1,900 fewer jobs would be needed under the reforms - cutting the maintenance workforce from about 10,000 to about 8,000.  
However, it insists most roles could be shed through voluntary redundancy, retraining and redeployment, instead of compulsory redundancies.
""These reforms are too important, especially given we started these conversations 18 months ago,"" said Mr Haines.
usands of rail workers from Network Rail and train companies have walked out in recent weeks due to the row over reforms as well as wages.
On Wednesday, a strike meant about 20% of train journeys went ahead.
RMT members will go on strike again, with the same impact on services on 18 and 20 August.
On Saturday, about 5,500 train drivers at seven rail companies who are members of the Aslef union will strike, which coincides with the Commonwealth Games and is the first day of the English Football League season.
Network Rail said its most-recent offer of an 8% pay rise over two years, with ""heavily discounted travel, a cash bonus and a guarantee of no compulsory redundancies"" had met many of RMT's demands.
""The alternative is to ask either taxpayers or passengers to fund a pay increase, and that is neither fair nor realistic,"" the company said.
It is understood that Network Rail was on two occasions close to reaching a deal, but union bosses then had a ""shift in tone"".
Mick Lynch, general secretary of RMT, hit back at Network Rail's latest move, saying an offer made was ""entirely conditional on mass redundancies and changes to conditions and working practices"".
""Rather than deceiving the staff about what they are actually proposing, the company now needs to get back round the table with RMT and work to resolve the issues in the dispute including their proposals for change and the union's demands for job security and a decent pay rise,"" he said.
ransport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""While we still encourage RMT to join talks and find a solution to this dispute that is fair for all, it's clear now that no deal was ever going to be good enough for the RMT, and they have left Network Rail no choice but to go ahead with these essential modernisations with or without their support.""

sports	Commonwealth Games: England's Emily Campbell wins weightlifting gold	"England's Emily Campbell added Commonwealth gold to her weightlifting medal haul with a record-breaking performance at Birmingham's NEC.
Campbell, 28, lifted a Games-record total of 286kg in the women's +87kg to beat Samoan defending champion Feagaiga Stowers, who managed 268kg.
She also broke the snatch Commonwealth record with 124kg and did the same in the clean and jerk, with 162kg.
Campbell was the first Team GB woman to win an Olympic weightlifting medal.
""I'm absolutely elated,"" Campbell told BBC Sport.
""I knew this would be a tough competition. I knew someone was not going to hand it to me on a plate, I knew I would have to work for it but I said, 'whatever I needed to lift today to win that gold medal, I was going to do it'.
""I hope people see how beautiful our sport is. Throughout the week you have seen it doesn't matter what you look like, what shape you are, what size you are, you can pick up a bar and do it. 
""It is not about coming to the Commonwealth Games or coming to the Olympics, it is is about doing something you love.""
One of two flagbearers for England at the Birmingham 2022 opening ceremony, Campbell took silver in Tokyo in 2021 and is a two-time European champion.
NEC announcer informed fans before the final that the weightlifting venue had become known as ""the party arena"" and the crowd made sure it lived up to its name.
Every time Campbell entered the stage they welcomed her with adrenaline-boosting cheers and she repaid the favour with a high-energy performance.
With her hair arranged in two buns on top of her head - one white and one red - she took on the role of circus ringmaster, opening her arms wide in celebration after every successful lift.
""We've been in the training hall in the back and we've heard the crowds all week and it has been mad, absolutely immense,"" Campbell added.
""There was a full house today. It is very nice to see actual fans coming to see weightlifting, it is all we have ever wanted.""
Stowers was her only close competitor for gold, with Australia's Charisma Amoe-Tarrant winning the battle for bronze.
Campbell looked dominant throughout, breaking the Games record with her second snatch attempt of 121kg before extending it to 124kg as the Samoan had to settle for 121kg.
Records continued to tumble as Stowers set a new Games total of 268kg with her first clean and snatch attempt.
Campbell immediately passed that as she raised her total to 276kg, then Stowers failed her next two attempts to give the England athlete gold with two attempts remaining.
me lifter, who uses her platform to advocate for better sports clothing for plus-size women, continued to put on a show, successfully lifting 162kg to bring the crowd to their feet before whipping her belt around her head in celebration."	/sport/commonwealth-games/62410337

politics	Watchdog apologises after MPs' Christmas expenses row	"Parliament's expenses watchdog has apologised for publishing advice that MPs could claim for the cost of an office Christmas party.
Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) faced a backlash from MPs after saying they could claim for festive get-togethers.
MPs on all sides rejected the guidance, with one calling it ""bonkers"" amid a cost of living crisis. 
Ipsa's chief executive Ian Todd said the body had ""got the messaging wrong"".
In a letter posted online, he added that some MPs had had to deal with ""phone calls, e-mails and in some cases abuse as a result of our guidance"".
Ipsa had initially defended its approach, saying after it was published that holding a ""modest gathering"" for MPs' staff was ""entirely appropriate"".
In his letter, Mr Todd said Ipsa had produced the guidance following requests for advice about applying the organisation's rulebook. 
He added that afterwards he was contacted by numerous MPs, who ""have made it clear to me that they have never made such claims in the past and have no intention of doing so in the future. I accept and respect that.""
""We got the messaging wrong by allowing the impression to form that this is what MPs were wanting to do, rather than our interpretation of the discretion available under the existing rules,"" he added.
""We are an independent body and we make our own decisions but occasionally, like everyone, we make mistakes.""
""In issuing it we also failed to recognise the public mood at a time of severe economic and financial pressures. I am sorry for that.""
In an update from Ipsa last week, MPs were told they could claim for ""festive office events"" for staff - as long as they were parliamentary in nature, not party political and represented value for money.
MPs were told they could claim for food, decorations and drinks - but not alcohol. 
was roundly criticised by MPs across the political spectrum.
Labour MPs were told it would ""clearly be inappropriate"" for them to claim at a time of rising living costs. Liberal Democrat Chief Whip Wendy Chamberlain also said none of her party's MPs would be claiming, calling the advice ""tone deaf"" amid the cost living crisis.
Conservative Former Brexit secretary David Davis called the rules ""bonkers"" and said Ipsa had ""missed the mood of the age"".
A spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he wouldn't be claiming for a party, and that MPs would have to ""justify all spending to their constituents""."	/news/uk-politics-63750920
health	Charity money stolen from Dunfermline woman with incurable cancer	"A woman who has incurable cancer says up to £4,000 was stolen from her charity fundraiser in Fife.
Claire Winter, 44, said hosting the event on Saturday had ""given her fire"" after finding out she would be on chemotherapy for the rest of her life.
However she was distraught to find a collection bucket of cash ""filled with notes"" had gone missing from the Crossgates Royal British Legion club.
Police Scotland said they were investigating the theft.
""I was absolutely distraught and my husband was physically sick,"" she said. ""We'd done all that work for nothing.""
Claire was first diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2019 three months after meeting her now husband Craig, 46.
Although loved ones including her two children were ""shell-shocked"", she said they assumed the illness would be treated and effectively cured.
following year she learned the cancer had developed to stage four after doctors removing her appendix noticed lesions on her spine and pelvis.
Claire now receives a host of maintenance treatments including oral chemotherapy to keep her alive -although doctors are unable to say for how long.
""It's just heavy and hard,"" she said. ""The quality of life is nothing to what it was before.
""You have good days and bad days. The mental side of it is even harder because every day you wake up knowing this is the deal you've been dealt and you need to make every day count.""
As part of making the most of her time, Claire decided to raise money for the charity CoppaFeel, after being inspired by its founder's autobiography.
She estimates between 150 and 200 friends and family turned up to support her ""Not Dead Yet"" event, which included a raffle and tombola.
Her father donated a bottle of whisky signed by the band Nazareth, which fetched £300, while Craig - a former professional footballer - raffled gloves signed by Hearts keeper Craig Gordon.
was stored in large pink collection buckets - but not all were brought home on Saturday night.
Claire said she noticed one was missing on Sunday morning and phoned the club.
Although she cannot be sure exactly how much was in the container, she said there had been at least £1,500 of large donations on top of many more smaller donations through the evening.
She said: ""The club was locked from the party and we knew we were going to get in - I messaged one of volunteers for British Legion who said no-one would be in until Monday.
""I assumed it would just be sitting there or a member staff had put it away safe but we couldn't find the pink bucket or the money.
""The whole thing was taken - someone walked out with it and somebody must have seen something.""
Agnes Guthrie, who is the club's treasurer, said staff had not found any buckets on Saturday night.
She added: ""It's so upsetting that this money has disappeared. Our staff are happy to speak to police about it if they contact us.""
Police in Fife said they were investigating the theft of a four-figure sum and have urged anyone with information to contact the non-emergency line.
Sgt John Nicol said: ""We're appealing for anyone with information on this theft, or if you believe you saw anyone acting in a suspicious manner in the Main Street area, to please come forward.""
In the meantime, Claire added that she will continue fundraising for CoppaFeel through her JustGiving page in the hope of raising awareness.
rity encourages people to receive regular checks in the hopes of catching breast cancer early.
Reflecting on the theft, Claire added: ""That was six months of my life, it was hard, hard work.
""Everybody has a conscience and theirs will not be serving them well. It's absolutely disgusting."""	/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-63741628
entertainment	Mercury Prize: Rapper Little Simz wins album of the year award	"Watch: 'It's crazy!' - Little Simz tells the BBC's Lizo Mzimba what the Mercury Prize means to her
London rapper Little Simz has won the Mercury Prize, for the best British or Irish album of the last 12 months.
28-year-old took the £25,000 award for her fourth album Sometimes I Might Be Introvert, a hip-hop coming-of-age tale delivered with a cinematic sweep.
She told the ceremony in London on Tuesday she was ""very overwhelmed and grateful"" to receive the honour.
And the star paid tribute to the other nominees, who included Self Esteem, Wet Leg, Harry Styles and Sam Fender.
""We all made incredible albums,"" she said on stage. ""We all changed people's lives with our music, and that's the most important thing.""
Little Simz adds the Mercury to the Brit Award she won earlier this year. That was for best newcomer, despite the fact she released her debut album seven years ago.
But she has grown in stature and acclaim with every release, and was also nominated for the Mercury for her last LP, Grey Area, in 2019.
Sometimes I Might Be Introvert reached number four in the UK album chart when it was released a year ago, and topped a BBC News ""poll of polls"", which combined the results of 30 critics' end-of-year lists for 2021.
Her appearances at the Reading and Leeds festivals over the summer also cemented her status as a crowd-pleasing main stage performer.
She is the 31st winner of the Mercury Prize, one of the most prestigious awards in music. Singer-songwriter Arlo Parks won last year, while other recent holders include Michael Kiwanuka, Dave and Wolf Alice.
Contrary to the title, Little Simz is bursting with confidence on her fourth album, which takes you on a journey through her family background and artistic struggles over a funky, orchestral brand of hip-hop.
On Little Q, she raps from the perspective of her cousin, who was stabbed in the chest in south London. The moving I Love You / I Hate You, meanwhile, is addressed to the father who abandoned her when she was 11. ""Never thought my parent would give me my first heartbreak,"" she observes.
r's laid-back delivery balances the sadness with empathy and understanding, and the music pulses with an unstoppable life force.
As well as rapping about her family, it is a deeply personal album on which Little Simz, real name Simbiatu Ajikawo, confronts her own inner self plus themes of race, womanhood and community.
She told BBC News after the ceremony: ""I just pray I can do what I can and contribute what I can to the landscape of music and society in whatever way, shape or form, and just try and speak for those that don't have a voice and use my platform and my gift for the greater good.""
In her acceptance speech, she paid tribute to her family and her co-writer and producer Inflo.
""There was times in the studio when I didn't know if I was going to finish this record,"" she told the audience at the Hammersmith Apollo. ""I was feeling all the emotions and really going through it. He stuck by me and pushed me to deliver this album for you guys.""
Mercury Prize judges said: ""This accomplished and complex yet entirely accessible album is the work of someone striving constantly to push herself.
""It deals with themes both personal and political while putting them against music that is as sophisticated as it is varied. The Mercury Prize is all about shining a light on albums of lasting value and real artistry. Sometimes I Might Be Introvert has both.""
uesday's ceremony, which featured performances from 11 of the 12 nominated acts, took place almost six weeks later than planned, after it was postponed at the last minute due to the death of the Queen.
On 8 September, several of the artists had already arrived and rehearsed for the show when news broke of the Queen's death.

politics	Mothers in Cambridge start campaign to support congestion charge	"A group of mothers have gathered together to support a controversial traffic scheme which could see a Cambridge congestion charge brought in.
Greater Cambridge Partnership (GCP) is proposing a £5 charge to be introduced by 2026-27.
But it has sparked opposition from shopkeepers who fear it will hit trade.
Elisabeth Whitebread, from Parents for the Cambridge Sustainable Travel Zone, said it was fair that drivers pay for the pollution their car's produce.
group is holding a protest meeting at Parker's Piece in Cambridge city centre on Saturday, which was also the site of a demonstration against the charging plans in November.
rge would affect private vehicles across the whole city, including Addenbrooke's Hospital and the rest of the BioMedical Campus, between 07:00 and 19:00 on weekdays.
would also see £50m of investment to expand the bus network and improved walking and cycling routes.
Cambridgeshire County Council would have final approval of any plans.
Ms Whitebread told BBC Politics East: ""Cambridge is great place to raise children, but we need a transport system fit for the 21st Century.
""There are no easy answers to this sort of thing, and of cause the charges are going to come in, in a staggered way. There will be upfront investment before the charge comes in. 
""I do think it is fair that people who are driving and causing pollution and congestion are the ones who should pay for it. The council has signed up to a climate emergency so it is really time for them to 'walk the walk.'""
Elissa Meschini, Labour councillor and chair of the Greater Cambridge Partnership which is looking to put forward the plans, said:  ""We have to come clean about the challenges we face. All we ask at this point is that people appreciate the extent of the challenge we have to address. We haven't made a final decision and it's important people understand it isn't an easy solution.""
GCP said the scheme would cut the number of car trips in Cambridge by 50% .
John Whitelegg, a visiting professor at Liverpool John Moores University who has studied congestion charge schemes, said: ""I'm surprised to hear the 50% figure. 
""I think that might prove to be wildly out of line with the outcome.""
But Prof Whitelegg, who is a former Green Party spokesperson in sustainable transport, believed congestion charge schemes are the way forward, and people who originally oppose it will come around to supporting it in the end.
""There's a pattern. There is initial opposition, then reluctantly accepting the scheme is being done, and then really liking it and everyone finding the advantages of it,"" he said.
But the plans have provoked strong opposition.
Clare King, 64, who has lived in Cambridge for 30 years and drives across the city every day for her job in a supermarket, said: ""Rather than the 10 minute car journey, I would need to walk to a bus stop, wait for a bus, catch two buses, then get off a bus near work and then walk to work. 
""That journey would take me between 45 and 50 minutes, provided the buses came pretty quickly.
""We need to improve the buses. We don't need to do it through treating residents as cash cows.""
Neil Mackay's family has been running a hardware store in Cambridge for more than 100 years, selling items including heavy duty metal piping, tools, ladders, workwear and gardening equipment.
""The sorts of materials we supply. You can't take those on a bus,"" he said.
""If I was a tradesman coming into Cambridge and I wanted some materials and I had a choice between coming down to see my old friend Neil Mackay in East Road and paying £10, or going to an alternative supplier who might be outside the zone - of which there are plenty - who has similarly priced goods, which is he going to do?""

""From Technoblade's earliest online days, he was always strategizing ways to delight and reward his audience - giving away online prizes, encouraging good sportsmanship, and most of all sharing his Minecraft adventures for entertainment and laughs.
""Even after his eventual successes he somehow managed to keep his good-natured humility, competing with an endearing balance between confidence and self-deprecating wit.""
Minecraft allows players to create their own experience in an imaginative virtual landscape, by digging holes to collect blocks.
Recent updates of the game have been used to help children explore and develop their career skills and knowledge, and to find solutions to real world problems such as flooding.

sports	Ukraine conflict: Olympic karate medallist Stanislav Horuna 'ready to fight' Russia	"Ukrainian Olympic karate medallist Stanislav Horuna says he is ready to fight for his country after joining the nation's defence against Russia.
Horuna has no previous military experience but says he is prepared to protect Lviv, where he was born. 
33-year-old won a bronze medal in the men's -75kg category at the Tokyo Games last summer. 
""Mentally I am ready, ready to fight. Because I know I am not attacking, I am defending,"" Horuna told Radio 5 Live. 
More than 1.7 million people have fled Ukraine because of the Russian invasion, according to the United Nations, many of whom have crossed to neighbouring countries such as Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Moldova.
Horuna is one of the Ukrainian soldiers helping people who have been forced to leave their homes during the conflict. 
Horuna's life has changed dramatically since standing on an Olympic podium to receive his medal less than a year ago, but he believes that Ukraine ""will soon be back to normal life"". 
""Of course not all Ukraine as many cities are totally destroyed, some cities are half destroyed and of course those people who left their homes and cities, now they are refugees,"" he added. 
""Many of them have left the country and their lives changed completely. I stay in a relatively safe place and we are trying to help those people who have left their houses.""
Horuna is one of several Ukrainian sportspeople to have joined their nation's military effort, including tennis player Sergiy Stakhovsky, heavyweight champion boxer Oleksandr Usyk and three-weight champion fighter Vasiliy Lomachenko.
Brothers Vitali and Wladimir Klitschko, both former heavyweight world champions, are also defending their homeland.
When asked if he has been treated differently because of his sporting success, Horuna said: ""I consider myself just another man on the barricades. 
""I do the same that other people do. We stay together and we resist. We help each other, we are so united and stronger than ever before. 
""And I don't see anything heroic in my decision to join the army, because everyone here is doing the same.""
wo months before his achievement in Tokyo, Horuna became the European champion in his category by defeating Azerbaijan's five-time world champion Rafael Aghayev, and he has no doubt that he will return to his karate training in the near future. 
""I guess in 10 days, maybe two weeks we will win this war and my theory is life will get back to normal,"" he said. 
""And I will be able to visit my gym, my dojo and continue my regular training. And I will start the preparation for the next tournament or championship. 
""We will see - I hope and believe it will finish soon because Russian army is running out of resources."""	/sport/karate/60654026
entertainment	Norwich Puppet Theatre bridge brought back into use after 30 years	"A unique bridge in a puppet theatre that gives audiences a ""magical"" experience has been brought back into use after more than 30 years.
metal structure at the Norwich Puppet Theatre was restored after a £41,000 Arts Council England grant.
Built in the 1980s, its use declined as long-string marionettes fell out of fashion in favour of glove and rod puppets like The Muppets.
Puppeteer Rachel Leonard said bringing the bridge back was ""very special"".
It is being used in the production Cinderella, with the grant funding also contributing to puppeteer training and making the show accessible.
Created by Boulton and Paul, who made their name from creating prefabricated buildings during war time, the bridge is unique in its ability to move across the stage and be rigged on split levels.
It hides the puppeteers from the audience and offers them a birds-eye view of the ""miniature actors"" on long strings to the stage below.
""The marionette is like the Stradivari of the puppet world,"" said Mark Mander, producer and director of Cinderella.
""In the 1940s marionettes were the predominant style of puppetry, then television came along with The Muppets and that become the predominant image of puppetry,"" Mr Mander said.
""But for many people marionettes are proper puppets, it takes real skill to operate them on very long strings, about 3m (10ft) in this case, and as you don't see the puppeteer at all it creates a very magical, immersive world.""
Ms Leonard added: ""It's such a lovely chance to do a puppet show where you're unaware of the puppeteers.
""We use a wooden control with wire pieces so what you're doing with your hands is not the same as what the puppets are doing. It's like playing an instrument.""
uppeteers on Cinderella have worked on some of the world's most loved shows including Star Wars, The Muppets, Rainbow, The Dark Crystal from Netflix and Disney's new live-action version of Pinocchio staring Tom Hanks, shot at Cardington Studios in Bedfordshire.
Puppeteer Ronnie Le Drew was Tom Hanks's double in the Disney live action remake of Pinocchio
""I was very thrilled Disney said that they were going to use a proper marionette at the beginning of the film,"" said Ronnie Le Drew, who has also operated Zippy from the children's TV show Rainbow since the 1970s.
He added: ""Of course after the Blue Fairy comes in Pinocchio becomes a CGI character but the first few moments there was real puppet manipulating walking across the workshop floor. It was just a joy.""
""It's one of the most exciting things I've done for film.""
re director Peter Beck said the venue was aware families were struggling with cost of living, and had held its ticket prices. 
""Post-pandemic it's been a challenging time for theatres, especially small theatres in terms of funding, but if we can't provide some entertainment, some light relief when people are working endless hours - what's the point?""

politics	Sturgeon breached ministerial code over ferry meeting, say Tories	"Scottish Conservatives have called on Nicola Sturgeon to refer herself for ""clear breaches"" of the ministerial code during the ferries fiasco.
used the first minister of failing to properly record a meeting with the then Ferguson Marine shipyard owner Jim McColl in May 2017. 
rty also alleges Ms Sturgeon failed to have a civil servant present.
A Scottish government spokesperson said the first minister had ""complied in full"" with the obligations of the code. 
mplaint follows evidence given by Ms Sturgeon to Holyrood's public audit committee last month.
She told committee members at the time she would provide details of the meeting with Mr McColl.
But Scottish Tory chairman Craig Hoy insists files lodged with the committee ""contain no substantive record of it"".
He says an email sent by an unnamed special adviser who was at the meeting does not contain the ""basic facts"" required to be recorded under the ministerial code.
Mr Hoy said: ""The email evidence which the first minister presents as the supposed minute of a meeting with Jim McColl is nothing of the sort because it reveals very little about what was actually discussed.
""This is made more worrying by the fact that Mr McColl has given a very different account of the discussion.
""Nicola Sturgeon also appears to have forgotten the clear distinction between special advisers and civil service officials.""
Mr Hoy added: ""Her evasiveness under questioning from the committee last month set alarm bells ringing, and the lack of detail in her subsequent correspondence adds to the suspicion that she has something to hide.
""The public deserves to know the truth. That's why, in addition to referring herself, Nicola Sturgeon must agree to hold a full, independent public inquiry into the whole ferries scandal.""
Earlier this week, Mr McColl claimed ministers later wasted £200m by rejecting an offer to end the impasse over two CalMac ferries.
Mr McColl revealed details of a proposal he made in 2019 to split the cost of finishing the ships, and limit the government's contribution to £50m. 
Instead, the shipyard in Port Glasgow was nationalised and the bill for completing the vessels has since risen by about £240m. 
riginal contract was for £97m, and £83m had been handed over to FMEL by the time it went bust. It was agreed that CMAL would not have to pay any more money. 
After the yard was nationalised in 2019, ""turnaround director"" Tim Hair estimated it would cost a further £110m-£114m to complete the ships. 
By March this year that figure had risen to £119m-£123m but in September new Ferguson boss David Tydeman advised MSPs the figure would probably rise to nearly £210m. 
rd's estimate is therefore £83m + £210m = £293m. 
Many commentators, including the Auditor General of Scotland, believe that £45m of written down government loans to FMEL should also be included - taking the total to £338m. That is £240m above the original contract price. 
re are also some additional costs that others believe could be added in. The process of nationalising the shipyard cost £8.3m. Troubleshooter Tim Hair was taken on at a daily rate of about £2,500. By the time he left earlier this year, he had billed the government nearly £2m for 595 days' work. 
government said Mr McColl's proposal breached EU state aid rules.
Mr McColl gave details of the offer, including legal advice that it was compliant with EU rules, in his latest submission to the public audit committee inquiry. 
ffer was made in the spring of 2019 when relations between Mr McColl's company Ferguson Marine Engineering Ltd (FMEL) and government ferries agency CMAL had completely broken down.
Ms Sturgeon has previously told the MSPs that Mr McColl's last-ditch offer was ""rigorously assessed"" but could not be considered for ""a range of state aid and legal procurement issues"".
A Scottish government spokesperson said the May 2017 meeting between Ms Sturgeon and Mr McColl ""was arranged through the civil service and so, by definition, officials were aware of the details"".
kesperson added: ""The meeting was recorded in the official record of ministerial engagements published by the government. An official - a special adviser - was present and a brief note of the outcome recorded. To claim otherwise is factually wrong.
""In evidence to the committee, the first minister gave a commitment to see whether information relating to actions resulting from the meeting could be made available. This has been done.""
government regards special advisers as temporary civil servants, therefore it argues it complied with the ministerial code."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63841683
technology	Fibrus: Belfast broadband firm wins major GB contract	"Belfast-based broadband company Fibrus has won its first major contract in Great Britain.
£108m scheme will upgrade broadband for more than 60,000 hard-to-reach homes and businesses across Cumbria in north-west England.
It is part of the UK government's Project Gigabit, which aims to improve broadband across the UK.
Fibrus is delivering a similar scheme in Northern Ireland known as Project Stratum.
roject, which is worth more than £200m, is largely funded by money which flowed from the Democratic Unionist Party's confidence and supply deal with the Conservative Party in 2017.
Project Gigabit is mostly focused on encouraging commercial investment with the government subsiding roll-out to mainly rural areas where the private sector would not otherwise connect.
Fibrus chief executive Dominic Kearns said the Project Gigabit contract was a significant development for the company.
""Winning this contract to connect Cumbria extends the Fibrus investment plan to 700,000 homes and £700m and sets us on the road to being central to national digital infrastructure."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63818934
business	Jack Dorsey: Twitter co-founder breaks silence on Elon Musk takeover	"witter co-founder and ex-CEO Jack Dorsey has addressed the mass sackings at his former firm, apologising for growing Twitter ""too quickly"".
Half of the social media giant's staff are being fired, a week after Elon Musk bought it in a $44bn deal.
Billionaire Mr Musk has said he had ""no choice"" but to slash the company's workforce as the firm is losing more than $4m (£3.5m) a day.
witter staff took to the platform to express their anger at the firings. 
In a statement posted on the microblogging site, Mr Dorsey - who quit as CEO in November and left the board of directors in May - said Twitter staff ""are strong and resilient. They will always find a way no matter how difficult the moment. I realise many are angry with me. I own the responsibility for why everyone is in this situation: I grew the company size too quickly. I apologise for that.""
""I am grateful for, and love, everyone who has ever worked on Twitter. I don't expect that to be mutual in this moment...or ever…and I understand,"" he added. 
His statement appeared to endorse the need for dismissals at the firm. The 45-year-old Mr Dorsey has been supportive of Mr Musk's takeover.
Back in April when Mr Musk first began his purchase of Twitter, Mr Dorsey said the 51-year-old was the ""singular solution I trust"" and that the South African's takeover was ""the right path...I believe it with all my heart"".
Mr Dorsey created Twitter in 2006 along with Evan Williams, Biz Stone, and Noah Glass. He sent the company's first Tweet, writing ""just setting up my twttr"". 
uts have come across Twitter's 7,500-strong work force, and there are fears it could damage the firm's content moderation efforts. 
Despite the dismissals Mr Musk has said the firm's policies remain ""absolutely unchanged"".
A host of major brands have halted advertising spending with Twitter in recent days, including Volkswagen, General Motors and Pfizer.
Almost all of Twitter's revenue currently comes from advertising, and Mr Musk has been looking for ways to cut costs and make money in different ways from the platform.
In a move much publicised in advance, Twitter launched a subscription service on Saturday allowing users to buy blue-tick verification on the platform for a monthly fee of $7.99 (£7)."	/news/technology-63527893
entertainment	The Beatles: Love Me Do celebrated at Sir Paul McCartney's former home	"wo acts have recorded versions of the Beatles' debut single at Sir Paul McCartney's childhood home to mark the 60th anniversary of the song's release.
Released on 5 October 1962, Love Me Do reached number 17 in the UK and number one in the US two years later.
Jazz singer Ni Maxine and indie pop band TRAITS performed in Liverpool's 20 Forthlin Road, where the track was written by Sir Paul and John Lennon.
Maxine said there had been ""a lot to live up to"" in recording in the house.
rformances were arranged by the National Trust, which cares for 20 Forthlin Road, as part of a series of events to mark the anniversary.
were chosen by Sir Paul's brother, Mike McCartney, the music writer and DJ Pete Paphides and representatives of the trust.
RAITS singer Kieran McCarthy said it had been ""the most special thing we could possibly imagine"".
""We only started the band in January and from this, it's got to be Glastonbury [next], as I can't top this.""
Maxine said there had been ""a lot to live up to"".
""It's such an amazing song and such an amazing legacy that follows it, so it's a real honour to be part of this,"" she added.
McCartney said he wanted his old home to be a focal point for the anniversary, as it was the place where the Beatles first found their sound.
""We want our little house to continue to inspire new creative generations,"" he told BBC North West Tonight.
""Our message is [that] something extraordinary can happen, whoever or wherever you are, with creativity and love.
""Everyone is welcome here and we hope everyone is inspired here.""
use was where Lennon and Sir Paul rehearsed and wrote about 30 early songs, including Love Me Do, on the front room floor.
McCartney said he could remember when he first heard the pair playing Love Me Do and how it was picked to be the band's debut single.
""There were many beautiful songs that floated upstairs to me, but that was the one was that was chosen,"" he said. 
""I heard them all from nothing. I could hear the guitar [and] the chords being formed.
""Our kid and John would always choose chords and change them and make them different and that was the genius of that group.""
Paphides said it was ""impossible to hear Love Me Do without thinking about the pop-cultural revolution for which it was undoubtedly a catalyst"".
""John Lennon's harmonica sounded to me like the bracing stink of Mersey mud.

business	HSBC climate change adverts banned by UK watchdog	"UK's advertising regulator has banned two HSBC advertisements for being ""misleading"" about the company's work to tackle climate change.
Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said the banking giant can no longer run the ads which promoted its plans to reduce harmful emissions.
watchdog said that the posters ""omitted material information"" about HSBC's activities.
It marks the ASA's first action against a bank for so-called ""greenwashing"".
An HSBC spokesperson told the BBC that ""The financial sector has a responsibility to communicate its role in the low carbon transition to raise public awareness and engage its customers.""
""We will consider how best to do this as we deliver our ambitious net zero commitments,"" they added.
Greenwashing - branding something as eco-friendly, green or sustainable when this is not the case - misleads consumers into thinking they are helping the planet by choosing those goods or services.
rts were seen at bus stops in London and Bristol last October, in the lead up to the highly-anticipated United Nations COP26 climate change summit.
rs outlined HSBC's efforts to plant trees and help its customers achieve ""net zero"" emissions. Net zero means not adding to greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere by cutting and trying to balance out emissions.
One poster showed an image of waves crashing on a shore with text that said ""Climate change doesn't do borders. Neither do rising sea levels. That's why HSBC is aiming to provide up to $1 trillion in financing and investment globally to help our clients transition to net zero"".
r advert was of tree growth rings and text which read ""Climate changes doesn't do borders. So in the UK, we're helping to plant 2 million trees which will lock in 1.25 million tonnes of carbon over their lifetime"".
ASA upheld complaints that the ads ""omitted significant information about HSBC's contribution to carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.""
""Customers... would not expect that HSBC, in making unqualified claims about its environmentally beneficial work, would also be simultaneously involved in the financing of businesses which made significant contributions to carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions,"" the regulator added.
HSBC's efforts to address climate change have come under scrutiny in recent months. 
In February, campaigners accused big banks, including HSBC, of pumping billions of dollars into new oil and gas production despite being part of a green banking group.
London-based ShareAction called on the banks to demand green plans from fossil fuel firms before funding them.
ShareAction said that 24 big banks, which joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance last year, had since provided $33bn (£29.1bn) for new oil and gas project. 
At the time, a HSBC spokesman said the bank was ""committed to working with our customers to achieve a transition towards a thriving low carbon economy"".
Meanwhile, a senior HSBC executive drew controversy in May when he accused central bankers and other officials of exaggerating the risks of climate change.
Stuart Kirk, who was the global head of responsible investing at the bank's asset management division, said: ""There's always some nut job telling me about the end of the world.""
His role, which was based in London, involved considering the impact of investments on environmental, social and governance issues.
In July, Mr Kirk resigned from the bank and said that his comments had made his position ""unsustainable"".

technology	Meta, Amazon, Twitter layoffs: 'Tech layoffs won't destroy American dreams of Indians’	"Many Indians who work on temporary visas in the US are facing an uncertain future after mass layoffs at big tech firms. Surbhi Gupta, who lost her job at Meta, tells her story of in her own words.
It was my mum's birthday. I was staying up late to wish her and that's when I started getting messages from my friends about layoff announcements. They were all anxious.
At around 6am here, I received an email that I'd been let go. I had joined Meta earlier this year as a product manager. My team was shocked because I'd been performing really well.
It went against my motto, work is worship, instilled early by my favourite teacher at school. Initially, it felt like the Titanic sinking because I was losing access to things one by one - workplace, then email, then laptop. But I was pleasantly overwhelmed and surprised in a positive way by my network on LinkedIn. Many colleagues, ex-colleagues and friends reached out in a very supportive way, making introductions and referrals. It made me feel like I have so many people in this country who care for me, made me feel like I belong to this country.
My last day at Meta is in January and my H1-B visa [a non-immigrant visa that allows firms in the US to hire foreigners for up to six years] allows me to stay in the US for another 60 days, so early March is the deadline for me to find another job. 
job search is going to be difficult now as hiring will be slow in December because of the holidays. But I'm very focused. I am in touch with multiple companies and exploring options.
What I'll miss most about Meta is the workplace and my colleagues. Being at Meta meant not only being able to build an amazing product for millions of people, but also being able to participate in fireside chats and growth and learning opportunities. As a product manager, it would have been rewarding to see the project I was working on go further.
My parents taught me to never give up in life. They tell me to stay strong because I'm a person who can convert problems into opportunities. They tell me 'aur kuch accha mil jayega' [you'll find something better].
But my ability to work and stay in the US depends on my H1-B visa. I moved to the US in 2009 and I have worked very hard to build my career on my own strength and intellect. I have worked in prominent companies like Tesla, Intuit, etc., built great products, got top ratings, paid taxes, and contributed to the US economy for more than 15 years, but I feel that I am in the same place as far as permanent residency goes because of the limitations of the H1-B. I was crowned Miss Bharat California [a beauty pageant] by my idol, Bollywood actress Sushmita Sen. I have walked the ramp at New York Fashion Week. I have my own podcast. 
We face unnecessary stress because the US has a country cap which takes forever for Indian H1-B holders to get a green card (permanent residency). Even though I am in the green card queue, when I track my status, I sometimes get a wait-time of two decades, and at other times, 60 years.
Our personal life suffers because of the uncertainty. Buying a home has been a question mark in my mind - do I invest in a home and then what if I have to leave. In spite of having gone ahead with the YC [Y Combinator is an American technology start-up accelerator], I can't start a company even though I have a great idea because I don't have a green card.
I travelled to 30 countries before turning 30 years old, but now I'm unable to travel much, even though it's my dream to travel the world, because I'm nervous about facing problems while trying to get my H1-B visa re-stamped. I have heard from my friends who work at great companies like Google and PayPal about getting stuck abroad.
I have even curtailed my travels home to India. A few years back, I got stuck in India. I had gone to attend a wedding and I had to get my H1-B visa stamped. But that took several months as it went into random administrative processing and I wasn't even sure when it would come through. The uncertainty and the wait caused problems in my marriage. The visa issues had a very big role in my marriage. It was not the only reason, but it became one of the major reasons for the break-up of my marriage. I also had to drop out of a semester at New York University, where I was studying at the time, because I didn't know when I would be able to return to the US. Why do people on H1-Bs have to deal with this?
I have not met my parents since the Covid-19 pandemic because they haven't been able to come to visit me for three-and-a-half years. They are elderly, and don't keep too well. I constantly think - if my parents need support, will I be able to go to help them? Nobody realises how it impacts our life.
But despite whatever has happened, I believe this experience too has a silver lining. Spirituality is a significant part of my life. I am a believer and follower of Sadhguru ji [as followers refer to Indian yoga guru Jaggi Vasudev]. He says that we should not be identified only by or limit our identity to our professional role. In Silicon Valley, the most frequently asked question is - Which company do you work for? But I am still me, not just a product manager. Everyone should realise that they are more than just the company they work for.

politics	Stephen Flynn: Who is the new SNP Westminster leader?	"Aberdeen South MP Stephen Flynn is set to face his first Prime Minister's Questions less than 24 hours after being elected the SNP's new Westminster leader.
Here is what we know about the 34-year-old and what colleagues expect of him.
Mr Flynn was born in Dundee and raised in the city and in nearby Brechin.
He studied politics at Dundee University before moving to Aberdeen - although he still travels back down the A90 to support Dundee United.
His hip gave way when he was a teenager, and he spent 17 years in ""constant pain"" and facing a ""daily physical and mental battle"" until eventually having replacement surgery in September 2020.
After marrying his wife in 2014, he was elected to Aberdeen City Council in a by-election the following year, and served as the SNP's group leader from 2016 until he became an MP in 2019.
He took Aberdeen South from the Conservatives - a seat which has bounced between Labour, the SNP and Tories at the last four elections.
Following his election as Westminster leader, Nicola Sturgeon congratulated both Flynn and Paisley and Renfrewshire South MP Mhairi Black, who was elected deputy leader, calling them a ""truly formidable team"".
SNP MP Stewart Hosie echoed that sentiment, telling the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""One thing you will see from Stephen is a different tone - perhaps more pointed, snappier, more vibrant. 
""I think he will bring a great deal to the table and a great deal to the independence cause as he holds the government to account.
""Stephen has rare gift of being able to communicate difficult things in a really effective way and I'm looking forward to seeing him deploy that particularly in PMQs today.""
Stephen Flynn says he will push the impact of the cost of living and Scotland's right to choose its future
Mr Flynn's maiden speech in the Commons underlines why colleagues hope he will be a punchy presence as leader.
He warned Conservative members that ""we will not forget, and we will not forgive this government"".
He added: ""Scotland rejects your austerity and Scotland rejects your Brexit, just as Scotland rejected your prime minister.""
Mr Flynn became a prominent member of the so-called Tuesday Club of male SNP MPs who regularly meet for five-a-side football, beer and curry nights.
gas industry is at the heart of his patch, and he initially argued against the idea of a windfall tax on the profits of big energy firms - something later embraced enthusiastically by the SNP.
In February, he told MPs: ""The last time the UK government implemented a windfall tax, investment in the North Sea oil and gas sector plummeted. 
""It fell off a cliff - in fact it has never got back to where it was. If that happens again, my constituents will lose their jobs.""
Mr Flynn has been linked to the leadership role for some time, with newspaper reports claiming he was set to oust Ian Blackford surfacing weeks before the Skye MP decided not to stand again.
However, SNP leader and first minister Nicola Sturgeon has insisted that the change is ""not a coup"". "	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63886702
health	Frenchay rehab facility unbuilt seven years after NHS pledge	"Campaigners who fought to stop the closure of Frenchay hospital said the NHS had not fulfilled its pledge to build a health facility on site.
Plans for a replacement community hospital were dropped in 2013.
It was decided instead to build a rehabilitation unit on site but no visible progress has taken place.
Integrated Care Board (ICB) said it remained ""committed to our plans for new rehabilitation facilities on the Frenchay site"".
Southmead Hospital is under severe pressure, as many are across the country, and a third of beds are currently blocked by patients fit for discharge.
Campaigners said given the need to relieve pressure, they could not understand why a rehabilitation centre with in-patient beds was such a long way off.
Campaigner Barbara Harris has been pushing for the unit to be built for years.
She said: ""All we're left with is a minor injuries unit, and an 800-bed acute hospital that has 300 bed blockers in it.""
""Small wonder that ambulances are queuing,"" she added.
Another campaigner, Daphne Havercroft, said there was a lack of scrutiny by South Gloucestershire Council: "" It has not come under Health Scrutiny (Committee) since January  2020.""
She added: ""If the councillors aren't taking an interest, what message is that sending to local people?""
A spokesperson for South Gloucestershire Council said: ""We are committed to working closely with our partners at North Bristol NHS Trust (NBT) and the NHS Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire ICB around the future development of rehabilitation and extra care facilities at Frenchay and improving health and care provision across the whole of South Gloucestershire is a priority for the council.""
w ICB that runs services in Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire said the facility was also very much in its plans, although no construction date has been given for it.
It would be part of a broader scheme to increase community rehabilitation, allowing more people to leave hospital earlier. 
An ICB statement said: ""Reducing delayed discharges from hospital remains a high priority for our system and we are continuing to invest in measures to improve discharge processes, reduce length of stay, and ensure that everyone can move on from hospital once they are medically well enough to do so.""

business	Manx government admits living wage calculation incorrect since 2017	"An error in how the Isle of Man Living Wage was historically calculated means the figure has been overestimated since 2017, the treasury minister has said.
mix-up meant the figure had been overstated by between 80p and £1.24 each year since its introduction.
Alex Allinson said corrected figures set the voluntary wage rate at £11.05 an hour this year, an 18p rise on 2021.
Dr Allinson said the ""regrettable"" mistake was found during a detailed review of the calculations used.
A mistake involving the cost of having a child in the family was made when the wage was initially calculated in 2017 as £8.61.
It was replicated in each subsequent years' figures, which many Manx employers adopted to ensure their workers could afford a decent standard of living.
ry of the error delayed the publication of the 2022 report by three months while the methodology was corrected before being externally validated by Loughborough University, which will continue to check future calculations.
Dr Allinson said he hoped people would have confidence that ""as soon as we spotted this inaccuracy, we have dealt with it"". 
Steps had been taken to ensure future calculations were correct, he added.
Dr Allinson said businesses who felt ""damaged"" after overpaying staff should contact the Cabinet Office, which would deal with them on a case-by-case basis.
Living Wage figure was calculated before inflationary pressures started to build, and plans to alter it in the short-term have been ruled out, he said.
government wanted to maintain confidence that it was a ""statistical, not a political"" calculation, and other measures were being used to address rises in the cost of living, he added.
Last year Tynwald voted to see the minimum wage, currently set at £9.50 an hour, increase to meet the Living Wage by 2026.

health	NHS trust apologises as man kept in hospital for more than a year	"A man with physical and mental health problems is ""living"" in a hospital despite being fit to leave, a court has heard.
man, who is in his 30s, has been in hospital for more than a year.
A barrister leading the man's legal team told how he had tried to ""escape"" and broke an arm during the attempt.
Court of Protection heard that he remained in hospital because no ""available alternative accommodation"" had been found. 
Manchester City Council has responsibility for his care, but the NHS trust involved has apologised for ""not yet"" identifying a ""suitable community placement"".
A lawyer representing another health authority told the judge that professionals involved were under pressure because of the ""state"" of the health and social care services.
Mr Justice Hayden, who is overseeing the case, asked why no plan for the man's discharge had been formulated and indicated that he would review the case in the near future.
""This is a case about a young man who has been in [hospital] for over a year,"" barrister Ben McCormack, who is leading the man's legal team, said in a written case outline.
""He is medically fit to be discharged.""
Mr McCormack said the man was ""living"" in hospital and added: ""The real problem is that no available alternative accommodation has yet been sourced.""
He said despite the ""wide range"" of public authorities involved, each of which supported discharge, the man remained in hospital without any ""alternative options actually yet on the table"".
""[He] dislikes being required to live in hospital,"" Mr McCormack told the judge.
""He feels imprisoned. He has tried to escape through the ceiling of the bathroom attached to his ward.
""He hurt himself, he broke his arm.""
Mr McCormack said the man had ""extensive health needs"" which would need to be met outside hospital.
But he added: ""We are not attempting to land a person on the Moon here.""
Mr McCormack said the man had a computer, and a television, and had watched the World Cup Final on Sunday.
""We will deploy any and every resource to try and get this man out of hospital,"" Vikram Sachdeva KC, who represented one of the health authorities involved, told the judge.
""We know the state that the health service and social care services are in.
""It is cold comfort to the individual, but the professionals do have that pressure.""
Barrister Alexis Hearnden, who represented the NHS trust involved, told the judge in a written case outline: ""The trust offers an apology to the court and [the man] that it has not yet identified a suitable community placement.""
She said ""progress"" had been made recently.
""[His] physical health has at times been extremely precarious,"" she said.
""During the currency of this hospital admission, his health has also fluctuated and a stroke in July 2022 set back plans to discharge [him] from hospital.""

health	NHS Wales: Grange Hospital A&E needs urgent improvement - HIW	"Urgent improvements are being called for at a new south Wales hospital's emergency department.
Healthcare Inspectorate Wales' (HIW) main concern is poor patient flow through the Grange Hospital in Cwmbran, which opened only two years ago.
rns about potential cross contamination in the ""Covid corridor"", out of date medicines and the security of harmful substances.
Aneurin Bevan health board said it welcomed the findings. 
Staff told inspectors they could not always deliver the standard of care they wanted to, due to increasing pressures and demand on the department.
report mirrors concerns raised in a previous inspection of Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales, where patients were found sitting on bins in waiting areas.
Grange, Wales' newest hospital, which opened on 17 November, 2020, has come under heavy criticism.
A report by the Royal College of Physicians in 2021 found that some trainee doctors and consultants were scared to come to work, with chronic understaffing and excessive workloads.
Earlier this year the hospital's medical director said the site needed to expand because demand had been higher than anticipated.
rd said it had acknowledged and responded to concerns raised, adding: ""We're also pleased to see that the report highlights the hard work and dedication of our staff during periods of extreme pressure on our services, during which patients were treated with courtesy, dignity and respect.""
's report paints a more positive picture of the running of the hospital, with staff feeling supported and patients praising the medical teams and their treatment.
However, the flow of patients through the hospital is hindering care.
Inspectors said until it can be improved, ""the health board will find it challenging to address a number of our concerns"".
One anonymous member of staff said patient flow was ""a national problem"" and believed there was ""good evidence that patients come to harm"".
used the analogy, ""If the bath is full and overflowing, don't make a bigger bath, sort out the plug hole"".
Patient Lee Pomroy echoed these comments.
He said: ""I've been there about three or four times. The hospital is fine, it's just the waiting times... half the time it's not their fault, it's just when people come in they have nowhere to put them.""
Lesley Hardy, 64, said: ""They did a Covid test and then they put me into an observation ward but that was really awful. There were four chairs in each corner of the room and they were hard chairs, there was no recliners so you couldn't sleep. 
""When I asked for a pillow just to put my head, because the pain was so bad, they said they didn't have the pillow in the actual hospital that I could have.""
Another patient, Kirsten Lapping, said: ""The patients got offered tea, coffee, sandwiches twice while I was there. The seats are not comfortable, but they never are. Relatives are asked to leave a couple of times so there was room for patients.
""There were so many people in there. I think they made an announcement there were 150 people in A&E at one point while we were there. So the wait was understandable.
""It was frustrating, I'm not going to lie but I understand that they are understaffed.""
Across Wales - and the rest of the UK - a shortage of staff in social care means patients are unable to be safely discharged from hospitals, despite being medically well enough.
means beds are unavailable for those arriving at A&E needing to be admitted to hospital.
In turn, this causes longer waits for patients in the emergency department.
Inspectors noted the waiting area at The Grange was very small and unfit for purpose.
gthy waits for patients caused some to be ""frustrated and sometimes angry"", though ""the majority were very complimentary about the staff"".
Some patients told inspectors they had sat on the floor because of a lack of space.
report said there could be more than 50 patients in the waiting room, with the majority physically or mentally unwell, posing ""a significant risk"" which ""placed stress and risk on the staff members"".
Inspectors spent three days at the hospital during August.
About three-quarters of patients will be treated in their own rooms with ensuite facilities
During August 7,530 people turned up at The Grange hospital - making it the second busiest A&E in Wales that month. 
Nearly one in five patients waited longer than 12 hours during that month. 
On the inspectors' first day, 14 ambulances were waiting outside, with one patient waiting18 hours to be ""offloaded"" from the ambulance to hospital staff because of an infection control risk.
Patients were assessed and triaged to reduce risks, but efforts to free up ambulances were sometimes hindered by the lack of space in the hospital.
In response to the HIW report, Welsh government said it was ""providing an additional £25m this year to transform urgent and emergency care services across Wales, with Aneurin Bevan UHB receiving £3m"".
In a statement it added that it had ""provided an additional £260k to the health board for improvements to its emergency department waiting areas this winter"".
""I fully accept there are mounting pressures on the NHS across Wales, but the problem seems particularly acute in Gwent where patient complaints at The Grange continue to mount,"" said Monmouth MP and Welsh Secretary David TC Davies. 
He added: ""We are being let down by those in charge who are pretending the current situation is acceptable when it is clearly not."""	/news/uk-wales-63571316
politics	Aberconwy asylum hotel plan attacked by Welsh government	"It is unacceptable that a north Wales hotel is housing asylum seekers without the Welsh government, councils or police being told, a minister has said.
Labour Social Justice minister Jane Hutt warned the Home Office risks fostering extremism and said the hotel was in a rural location with none of the specialist services needed nearby.
g used to ease overcrowding at Kent detention centres.
Home Office said hotels provided a short-term, safe solution.
BBC Wales is not naming the hotel for safeguarding reasons.
Ms Hutt compared the situation to the lack of consultation over Penally, an army camp used to house asylum seekers which was closed after it was criticised by inspectors.
""The Welsh government is aware of the pressures faced by the Home Office in providing accommodation for asylum seekers,"" Ms Hutt said in a letter, seen by BBC Wales, to the UK Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick. 
""However, it is unacceptable that your department has failed to contact or notify the Welsh government, members of the Senedd and key partners such as local authorities, health boards and the police in Wales before putting these arrangements in place.""
She said the north Wales hotel was being used ""with no prior consultation or notification of use"".
Ms Hutt said that without proper engagement ""there could well be a lack of trust and confidence within the wider community; this in turn could result in increased risks for the asylum seekers themselves. 
""We have particular concerns about the impact on community cohesion within the areas of hotels being established, which may also experience increased, adverse interest from hostile organisations which are active within Wales. 
""It is short-sighted to focus dogmatically on one Home Office aim - to reduce the costs of the asylum system - in ways which are likely to foster extremism which the Home Office seeks to eliminate.""
Manston asylum numbers are back below 1,600, says Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick.
Ms Hutt added the north Wales hotel is in a rural location ""with none of the specialist services which asylum populations require - including traumatic stress mental health services, communicable disease specialists, English for Speakers of Other Language tutors, immigration legal advisors, interpreters, or refugee drop-in services"".
She asked that Welsh ministers are informed in the same way and at the same time as MPs and councils, urged the Home Office to use contingency accommodation and ""provide sufficient funding"" to minimise the risk to residents at hotels and within the community.
Mr Jenrick told the Commons on Monday that he had agreed with officials that all MPs should be informed of new facilities opening in their constituency ahead of time.
Earlier this week Conservative Aberconwy Senedd member Janet Finch Saunders said the decision had sparked local anger.
Writing to the Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, she expressed ""serious concerns"" and demanded the decision be reversed.
Conwy council said it was also not given advance warning of the Home Office plan.
An email from the operators to local politicians on Saturday, seen by the BBC, said: ""With the current crisis in Kent in relation to the overcrowding of detention centres, the Home Office have reached out asking us to take a short-term accommodation contract, which we felt was the right thing to do.
""This was an urgent project for them and we have been contracted with immediate effect.
""The agreement we have entered appoints us as the host accommodation provider, but all security is provided by the Home Office.""
Home Office said it cost £5.6m every day to house more than 37,000 asylum seekers in hotels.
A spokesman added: ""We have received Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt's concerns and thank the Welsh government for their continued cooperation thus far.
""We accept that while hotels do not provide a long-term solution, they do ensure accommodation provided is safe, secure, leaves no-one destitute and is appropriate for each individual's needs."""	/news/uk-wales-politics-63570024
