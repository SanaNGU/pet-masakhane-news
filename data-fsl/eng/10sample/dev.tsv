sports	Andy Murray regrets not playing in Scotland more after Battle of the Brits appearance	"Andy Murray wishes he had played in his Scottish homeland more after taking part in this week's Battle of the Brits in Aberdeen.
Dan Evans beat Andy Murray as England clinched the tournament with an 8-4 win over Scotland.
However, Murray and older brother Jamie teamed up to beat Evans and Neal Skupski 6-3 6-4 in the final match of the event.
""I haven't played here since 2006 I think it was,"" Andy Murray said.
""Great to be back. I wish I had done more of this during my career. I regret that a little bit after experiencing the last couple of days, it was great.""
ree-time Grand Slam and 2015 Davis Cup winner Murray, 35, has played at Glasgow's Emirates in recent years but last year's Battle of the Brits had to be postponed because of rising Covid cases.
Aberdeen event is organised by Jamie Murray, 36, and came as the younger Murray brother finished 2022 with a ranking of 49 after 26 wins from 45 singles matches.
""My movement was good this week,"" added Andy Murray.

health	Strep A links investigated after child's death in Powys	"Links with the invasive group A streptococcal disease (iGAS) are being investigated after the death of a child in Powys, health experts have said.
Public Health Wales is working with local health officials and the council following a possible link to a ""very rare complication"" of the disease.
PHW's Dr Ardiana Gjini said people ""identified for public health action have already been contacted"".
""We remind parents to be vigilant for signs and symptoms,"" she said.
Most often, symptoms are mild - a sore throat or a skin infection that can be easily treated with antibiotics.
But strep A can cause a range of symptoms and one is scarlet fever, which mostly affects young children and, again, needs antibiotics.
Very rarely, strep A can also cause invasive group A streptococcal infection or iGAS which happens when the bacteria gets past the body's immune defences.
NHS Wales' 111 phone service took more than 18,000 calls on the weekend - more than double that of the same period last year - amid concern about strep A symptoms.
re have been 15 confirmed deaths of children with strep A since September, including Hanna Roap, seven, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan.
Her father, Hasan Roap, 37, has previously told BBC Wales how his family had been ""traumatised"" and ""devastated"" by her death within 24 hours of being taken ill.
Dr Gjini, a consultant in communicable disease control, said: ""While we understand that parents are likely to be worried, cases of invasive group A streptococcal infection (iGAS) remain rare in Wales, and children have a very low risk of contracting the disease.""
PHW has made a symptom checker for parents with a traffic light system to help them decide when to get medical help.
Referring to the child's death in Powys, Dr Gjini said: ""We offer our deepest condolences to the family, friends and all those affected.  
""A multi-agency incident management team is following normal processes, and investigating links to invasive group A streptococcal disease (iGAS), a very rare complication of group A streptococcal infection.
""People identified for public health action have already been contacted and provided with appropriate treatment and advice.
""Individuals who have not been contacted do not need to take any specific action.
""However we remind parents to be vigilant for signs and symptoms of scarlet fever and iGAS."""	/news/uk-wales-63959512
politics	Brexit: French tourism slump after leaving EU, Brittany Ferries says	"umber of people arriving at a UK port from France has more than halved after Brexit, a ferry firm has said.
Portsmouth ferry port saw 338,000 arrivals in 2019 but only 155,000 in 2022, according to Brittany Ferries.
firm said ""Brexit-related friction"" including a need for passports was a major factor, although sailings to and from Ireland, within the European Union, had seen increased business.
Home Office said the UK's entry rules were relatively generous.
Brittany Ferries said the vast majority of lost visitors were French holidaymakers, including student groups.
Spokesman Nigel Wonnacott said: ""We used to have loads of coaches parking outside with happy schoolchildren enjoying Portsmouth, going up to London and we really don't see much of that any more.
""Post-Brexit, French travellers are required to travel [to the UK] with a passport so it's expensive for them to get a passport because it's about 90 euros (£78), and it's also a big administrative burden.
""For Portsmouth, for the surroundings, for UK plc it's the loss of a significant number of potential travellers and all the richness that they bring economically and culturally.""
Previously the Tourism Alliance, which represents the British tourism industry, estimated a £875m loss to the UK economy from lost student groups in 2022.
Brittany Ferries said many French visitors had switched to its sailings to Ireland.
Last year saw a 30% increase in passengers travelling on its routes between Ireland, and both France and Spain, compared to 2019, the firm said.
Brittany Ferries operates services from France to Rosslare in Ireland and to Plymouth, Poole and Portsmouth in England.
A Home Office spokesman said the UK's rules were ""among the most generous in the world"".
kesman said visitors from France and other affected countries were told almost a year in advance of the requirement to use a passport from October 2021.

politics	Scottish government back in court over definition of 'woman'	"A campaign group has taken the Scottish government back to court over its definition of ""woman"" in legislation promoting gender balance on boards.
A judge ruled in February that ministers should not have ""conflated"" women and trans people in the bill, as they have separate protections in law.
But the For Women Scotland group is not happy with how the government revised the bill following the ruling.
Lady Haldane will preside over two days of arguments at the Court of Session.
Scottish government wants the case dismissed, arguing that its legislation is now in line with the terms of the 2004 Gender Recognition Act.
res on the Gender Representation on Public Boards Act, which was passed by MSPs in 2018.
gislation, which aims to ensure gender balance on public boards, originally stated that it included people who were living as a woman and who either had gone through or intended to go through the gender recognition process.
For Women Scotland contended that ministers had broken with the separate definitions of women and trans women laid out in the 2010 Equality Act - and had thus acted beyond their powers.
group lost an initial judicial review in 2021, but were successful on appeal.
Lady Dorrian ruled that by incorporating trans people who were living as women into the definition of woman, the bill ""conflates and confuses two separate and distinct protected characteristics"".
Because the bill singled out trans people living as women, the judge said it sought to apply to ""only some of those with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment"".
Her judgement also stressed that the case was about ""interpreting the law in relation to the legislative competence of the Scottish parliament"", and not transgender rights - ""a separate policy issue entirely"".
Scottish government responded by revising the guidance that accompanies the legislation, to stress that it covers women as defined by the Equality Act - but also trans people as defined by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act (GRA).
guidance quotes directly from the 2004 Act, and reads: ""Where a full gender recognition certificate has been issued to a person that their acquired gender is female, the person's sex is that of a woman. And where a full gender recognition certificate has been issued to a person that their acquired gender is male, the person's sex becomes that of a man.""
government's written argument for the case says the GRA is ""unambiguous"" that a certificate provides for a change of sex, and  that ""there is nothing in the 2010 Act which takes away from the fundamental proposition"" of the 2004 Act.
For Women Scotland argue that the guidance still does not comply with the court's ruling, and that by making reference to sex the government was ""still confusing the protected characteristics and are trying to redefine 'woman' yet again"".
group's lawyer Aidan O'Neill KC argued that obtaining a gender recognition certificate should not ""result in a change of sex for the purposes of the Equality Act"".
He said if it did, it would ""run a coach and horses through the preservation of safe spaces for women and single-sex provision for women under the Equality Act"".
roceedings are taking place at the same time as MSPs are considering separate legislation which would make it easier for trans people to obtain a gender recognition certificate.
Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison told MSPs there would be ""no change to the protections under the Equality Act"", adding: ""Helping one group to better access their rights does not mean diluting or diminishing the rights of another group.""
Asked about the judicial review, the minister said she was ""not going to comment on a live court case""."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63568047

entertainment	Joni Mitchell says her music upset male artists in the 1970s	"Joni Mitchell has said her music did not get the recognition it deserved in the 1970s due to music industry sexism.
musician, whose introspective, confessional songs became touchstones of the singer-songwriter genre, said she ""took a lot of flak"" at the time.
""People thought that it was too intimate,"" the 79-year-old said in a rare interview with Sir Elton John. 
""I think it upset the male singer-songwriters. They'd go, 'Oh no. Do we have to bare our souls like this now?'""
She added: ""I think it made people nervous.""
r said she was pleased that contemporary artists seemed better equipped to express the feelings of loss and sorrow that she explored on landmark albums like Ladies of the Canyon (1970) and Blue (1971).
""It took to this generation, they seem to be able to face those emotions more easily than my generation,"" she told Sir Elton in an interview for his Rocket Hour radio show on Apple Music.
It is one of the singer's first full-length interviews since recovering from a brain aneurysm in 2015, which temporarily left her unable to walk and talk.
r became friends during Mitchell's rehabilitation, when she hosted ""Joni Jams"" with fellow musicians in her California living room.
""Music has helped you so much,"" said Sir Elton, as he described her ""incredible"" recovery.
Mitchell is considered one of the finest singer-songwriters of her era, once described by a critic as the ""Yang to Bob Dylan's Yin, equalling him in richness and profusion of imagery"".
Her gift is for writing deeply personal, folk-inspired, song-poems that explored the darker sides of life and love. Tracks like Both Sides Now, A Case Of You and River are considered standards.
But after her aneurysm, she had to relearn how to sing and play guitar, watching old videos of herself ""to see where I put my fingers"".
""It's amazing what an aneurysm knocks out,"" she previously told CBS News. ""You don't know how to get out of a chair, you don't know how to get out of a bed. You have to learn all these things by rote again.""
In recent years, the singer has attended concerts celebrating her music, and was given the prestigious Kennedy Center Honor last December.
US President Joe Biden paid tribute to the star at the ceremony, saying: ""Her gift touches the range of human nature and the sense of struggle and how we overcome and how we love.""
Mitchell made her return to the stage this summer with an unannounced performance at the Newport Folk Festival - where she first performed in 1969.
w was arranged by country star Brandi Carlile, who has worked diligently to remind the world of Mitchell's legacy, performing tribute concerts and writing liner notes for the singer's archive box sets, as well as becoming a steadfast friend.
During the show, Mitchell performed tracks like Circle Game, Both Sides Now and Big Yellow Taxi, surrounded by friends on a set that recreated the look of her California living room.
Speaking to Sir Elton, the star said the entire concert was performed without a rehearsal. ""Didn't have any,"" she laughed. ""We just winged it.""
ger also addressed how her voice had changed over the years as a result of smoking and ill-health - noting that she opted to play guitar on Just Like This Train during her Newport concert instead of trying recreate the original's soaring vocals.
""I couldn't sing the key,"" she explained. ""I've become an alto. I'm not a soprano any more, so I couldn't sing the song. 
""I thought people might feel lighted [betrayed] if I just played the guitar part, but I like the guitar part to that song. So anyway, it was very well received, much to my delight.""
Sir Elton hinted that the Newport Folk Festival performance was being lined up for an official release.
""Yeah, we're trying to put that out,"" Mitchell confirmed.
She has since announced another live appearance - her first headline concert for 23 years - in Washington state next June.
Sir Elton also had a suggestion for getting Joni back into the studio. ""I want you to make an album in this room. Like Johnny Cash did with Hurt,"" he said.
""Every corner of this room is Joni. I've been to a lot of places in my life, but this room is one of the most special rooms I've ever been to in my whole life.""
Accepting the compliment with grace, Mitchell declined to speculate on whether she would return to recording music.
""We did some background vocals up in the balcony once,"" she said. ""That's the only time we've recorded in this room.""
full interview can be heard on Sir Elton's radio show on Apple Music from 17:00 GMT on Saturday, 12 November.

technology	Rogers outage: Why a network upgrade pushed millions in Canada offline	"In early July, a massive network outage at Rogers, a Canadian telecoms giant, forced more than 10 million customers - over a quarter of the country's population - off their internet or wireless services. The firm is now under intense pressure from regulators to explain what happened.
quences of the 19-hour nationwide outage ranged from the potentially dangerous, to the frustrating, to the ironic.
Police services reported that 911 services were inaccessible on many mobile phones. Hospitals reported communications problems, and one Ontario hospital had to redirect cancer patients when emergency radiation treatments were affected by the outage.  
Banking services were disrupted, and many businesses could not accept debit payments or could only take cash.
Fans of pop superstar The Weeknd - who hails from Toronto - were turned away after he was forced to cancel a hometown tour stop at the Rogers Centre (yes, the same Rogers) stadium.
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) - the regulatory body that oversees Rogers and other Canadian telecoms  - couldn't receive calls.
mpany, one of Canada's main telecoms firms, is now facing intense scrutiny from the federal government and the CRTC, which has ordered Rogers to explain in detail what caused the ""unacceptable"" shutdown.
Rogers CEO Tony Staffieri blamed the system failure on a maintenance update and has apologised to customers, offering a five days service credit as compensation.
But questions remain about how a seemingly routine process left millions without crucial access to online services - and on Friday, a Parliamentary committee said it would be studying the outage in meetings this month.
Long before the outage, expressing frustration with Canada's telecoms industry has been described as a national pastime, uniting the country much like ice hockey and the ubiquitous Tim Hortons coffee chain.
""Rogers, Bell Canada and Telus are known as the companies that you love to hate,"" said Richard Leblanc, a professor of law, governance and ethics at York University in Toronto.
firms control 90% of the country's telecoms market.
""We're essentially beholden to three companies,"" said Mr Leblanc. ""They've got so much authority and control.""
Experts say it's a symptom of Canada's strict foreign ownership rules for the industry. 
government has, for years, supported industries like the airlines and the telecoms out of fear that foreign countries might take over, said Ben Klass, a PhD candidate at Carleton University's School of Journalism and Communication. 
""As the neighbour of the United States, Canada has got a bit of a complex. We want to ensure we don't just become a branch plant of the US.""
gopoly isn't cheap - Canadians also pay some of the highest mobile phone and roaming rates in the world, according to multiple studies.
Industry analysts say Canada's rather non-competitive telecoms market has allowed its Big Three - Rogers, Bell and Telus - to face few consequences for sometimes shoddy service.
In a statement, Mr Staffieri vowed Rogers ""will make every change and investment needed to help ensure that [a similar outage] will not happen again"" and would work with the industry to ensure certain essential services would not be interrupted by technical issues.
Bell's top executive, Mirko Bibic, said last week the company takes its role in Canadians' communications networks ""very seriously"" and was investing billions in upgrades for a ""robust and resilient"" infrastructure.
And telecoms firms have argued that Canada's large land mass and sparse population make it expensive for telecoms to provide service.
But Rogers in particular has had a rough time in recent months.
July's massive outage was the second in two years.
In April 2021, the company's wireless network crashed in a similar fashion, affecting calls, text messages and data services. At the time, Rogers blamed the failure on a software update by one of its equipment suppliers.
Months later, the company was hit with a public relations crisis as the family-owned business suffered a showdown between siblings, reminiscent of HBO television show Succession.
Edward Rogers - the namesake and only son of the late family patriarch - sought to unilaterally remove then-chief executive Joe Natale, blaming him for the firm's underperformance.
But Mr Rogers was stymied by his mother, Loretta, and two sisters, who closed ranks around Mr Natale, setting the stage for a very public family feud.
ute eventually made its way to court, where a judge sided with Mr Rogers. He went on to hand-pick Mr Staffieri, who is now the current CEO, saying he was among ""the most highly regarded and seasoned"" executives in the industry.
For Rogers, the timing of this outage blunder was particularly bad, as the company is working to close a proposed C$20bn ($15bn; £13bn) takeover of competitor Shaw Communications.
Mr Staffieri said this week that Rogers remains committed to the merger.
But Rogers still needs the approval of the Competition Bureau Canada - the national antitrust authority  - and the federal government.
And the massive outage raised doubts that the relevant authorities will opt to put more power in the hands of a single company.
""It certainly won't help their cause,"" said Mr Klass.
""Just the fact that this outage occurred on such a wide scale and it would have been worse had Rogers already taken Shaw over"", with an even larger customer base knocked offline.
As Canadians saw, the country's outsized reliance on just three telecoms firms make it susceptible to sweeping network crashes.
But experts say this reliance on a few firms also makes Canada vulnerable to cyber-attacks.
""We've put all our eggs in one basket, and that's now a target for threat actors - Russia, China, Iran, North Korea,"" said York University's Mr Leblanc.
""You don't have to attack financial services, or healthcare, or emergency services, you just have to attack the telco because all these industries are contingent on these two or three players,"" he said.
If a system failure could shut down the system for hours, hostile actors could do much more damage.
Rogers has until Friday to comply with the CRTC's demand for a detailed account of last week's failure.
Many industry experts have gone one step further, calling for a public probe into how this most recent outage occurred.
""This cannot happen behind closed doors,"" said Mr Leblanc. ""It needs to be a public inquiry, where the telcos are hauled in front of elected politicians. There needs to be accountability.""
For now Mr Leblanc, a long-time Rogers customer, has done the only thing he can do: call the competition.
""Someone is coming over on Saturday to install my internet,"" he said. ""I went with Bell."""	/news/world-us-canada-62174477
business	Londonderry city deal: Council seeks further funding	"Derry and Strabane councillors have agreed to write to the UK Treasury requesting additional funding for its city deal at a meeting on Tuesday. 
It comes after councillors were informed plans may have to be scaled back in light of inflation. 
uncil will also seek support from the Department of Finance due to ""construction inflation and further financial pressures"".
In the deal, funding of £250m will be invested in the region over 15 years.
It has hopes of creating 7,000 jobs and is the largest single investment made in the region with the potential to add about £210m a year to the area's economy.
major projects are proposed within the deal, with a focus on health and life sciences and digital industries.
At Tuesday night's meeting, Derry City and Strabane District Council chief executive John Kelpie told councillors the difficulties facing the city deal projects mean their benefits ""will be reduced"".
Mr Kelpie said progressing other major projects such as university expansion and infrastructural projects in parallel with the city deal was always deemed as important, but inflationary costs were an issue.
Some of the projects proposed in the deal include:
Speaking at the meeting, DUP cllr Maurice Devenney said costings were now ""a lot greater than expected"" and asked what those involved in Belfast city deal are doing ""to balance their books around budgets"".
SDLP cllr Brian Tierney added that the letter to the Treasury should reflect that the project was always intended to be a partnership and the council were ""never the sole carriers of this"". 
He added: ""It's not fair that because the prices go up, this council and the citizens of this district have to carry the can. If there are difficulties financially, all of the partners have to come together to sort out these issues. 
""The only way we can sort them out is by re-jigging the projects. Any response to the inflationary costs has to be met by the British government."" 
An update report by the council cited the ""growing scale and impact of increasing construction, materials and energy costs and inflation due to current national and global economic circumstances"".
It stated: ""The overall consequence of the above is that, at present, cost estimates for almost all of the projects as envisaged at Strategic Outline Case stage and developed since, are currently projected to be very considerably in excess of the available funding.""
report suggested solutions will include ""a range of considerations such as a reduction in complexity to some of the projects, mitigation of site specific issues highlighted through initial design development which have led to increased cost projections, adjustments to design and specifications etc and application of additional budget if possible by individual project partners""."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-foyle-west-63801500
technology	How India is building a pearl farming industry	"In 2016 Narendra Garwa was facing a desperate financial situation. His small book store in the village of Renwal, Rajasthan, was running at a loss.
With a family to support and little education, he searched the internet for other money-making ideas. He had some success growing vegetables in plastic bottles, but then came across a potentially more profitable crop - pearls.
""Rajasthan is a dry area with water issues. It was a challenge to think of growing pearls with limited water but I decided to try,"" he says.
Pearls are formed when a mollusc reacts to an irritant in its protective membrane. The mollusc deposits layers of aragonite and conchiolin, which together form nacre, also know as mother-of-pearl.
In the wild, pearl formation is rare so most pearls sold these days are from farmed molluscs, usually oysters or freshwater mussels. 
ur the mollusc to form a pearl, an irritant is artificially introduced into the creature. However, it is a delicate process and the mussels or oysters must be carefully handled, as Mr Garwa found.
""My first attempt was a disaster,"" he admits. Of the 500 mussels he purchased, only 35 survived. 
Mr Garwa had travelled to Kerala to buy the mussels - a journey of 1,700 miles involving a 36-hour train journey. He also used his savings and borrowed money to come up with the 16,000 rupees (£170; $200) needed to buy the molluscs.
In addition, Mr Garwa had dug a 10ft by 10ft pond in his back garden to keep the creatures in.
Despite the setback, he did not give up. Instead, he took a five-day course in pearl farming.
""Growing an oyster is like bringing up a baby,"" he says.
""Monitoring the the water throughout the growth period is crucial to achieving high quality and volume of produce.""
Now he has a 40ft by 50ft pond, which he treats with multivitamins and alum which maintains the correct pH level required for growth. 
urvival rate of his mussels has risen from 30% to more than 70% since becoming more familiar with the process. Mr Garwa expects to produce around 3,000 pearls this year, which he can sell for between 400 and 900 rupees (£4-£10; $5-$11).
Indian government has been encouraging pearl fishing as part of its Blue Revolution, a plan to modernise the nation's fishing industry.
Under the scheme the government pays for half the cost of setting up a pond for pearl fishing, and so far the Department for Fisheries has given financial support to 232 pearl farming ponds.
""Pearl farming is one of the most lucrative aquaculture businesses and the government is encouraging farmers to take up this farming,"" says Jujjavarapu Balaji, Joint Secretary of Marine Fisheries.
Not everyone is impressed with this wave of pearl farming activity. Critics include Gunjan Shah, who is the fifth generation of his family to be in the pearl trading business.
""The culture of pearl farming has increased in India but I think the pearls grown in every nook and corner are not of very good quality"" says the owner of Babla Enterprises, based in Mumbai.
More technology of business:
He says India is producing too many of the wrong kind of pearls.
""What India needs at present is people who can grow sea water pearls if we want to compete with China. Indian oysters are small but China has hybrid oysters which produce large pearls.
""Cultured South Sea pearls are the most valuable type of cultured pearl on the market today. These pearls come in a gorgeous variety of sizes, shapes and colours. A strand of South Sea pearls can be as expensive as $10,000 (£8,500) or more. They are very rarely produced in India.""
He says the government should be looking to develop this part of the industry.
In its defence, the government says it will take time to build up a competitive pearl farming sector.
""Pearl family is specialised farming, so this sector will take time to grow. The plan is to see the increase in the next three years,"" says Mr Balaji, from the Department for Fisheries.
""Once we are able to grow enough pearls for local consumption then we can focus on exports,"" he adds.
As for Mr Garwa, as well as farming pearls, he also offers courses for those who want to learn how to do it.
Reena Choudary, 28, was one of his students, and just like her tutor her first effort last year was a failure.
""I lost all the oysters - none of them were able to produce,"" she says.
But this year, she expects to produce around 1,000 pearls. 
Starting an independent business was a big leap for her, particularly as women in her region are often expected to look after the home rather than work. 
""For people like us this smells like freedom,"" she says. ""We have learnt how we can be independent, help towards contributing to the family and have a say in family matters."""	/news/business-62204515
entertainment	Megan Thee Stallion: Jury finds Tory Lanez guilty of shooting rapper	"Rapper Tory Lanez has been found guilty of shooting fellow hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion in 2020.
A jury in Los Angeles convicted the 30-year-old Canadian of felony negligent discharge of a firearm, assault with a semi-automatic firearm, and carrying a loaded and unregistered firearm.
He faces more than 20 years in prison.
Megan Thee Stallion, a 27-year-old Grammy-winning rapper, earlier testified that she was shot in the feet after leaving a pool party.
Lanez showed no reaction as the verdict was read out. He was remanded in custody and is due to be sentenced on 27 January.
It was not immediately known whether he planned to appeal.
Speaking after the case concluded, one of Megan Thee Stallion's lawyers told reporters ""the jury got it right. I am thankful there is justice for Meg"". The rapper was not in court to hear the verdict.
During the trial, Megan Thee Stallion, whose real name is Megan Pete, testified that she was shot and wounded at the party in the Hollywood Hills on 12 July 2020.
rapper argued that Lanez, whose real name is Daystar Peterson, became enraged after she had disparaged his musical talent. She said she had demanded to be let out of a luxury car before he fired five rounds at her.
She told the jury the Canadian had told her to ""dance"" before opening fire.
She also testified that he had offered her $1m (£830,000) to keep quiet about the attack because he claimed to be on probation for a weapons offence. She initially said to police that she had cut her feet on glass.
Lanez denied the charges relating to a dispute with the fellow artist and his lawyer, George Mgdesyan, unsuccessfully argued that the investigation had been botched.
He said it was Megan Thee Stallion's friend Kelsey Harris who had shot her, adding that it was all about ""jealousy"". 
Several bullet fragments were removed from Megan Thee Stallion's feet after the shooting, but some remain.
She also acknowledged in her testimony that she had been ""intimate"" with Lanez.

politics	SNP preparing for general election, says Ian Blackford	"SNP is preparing for a general election as time ""needs to be up"" for the Tory government, the party's Westminster leader has said.
Ian Blackford said people in Scotland would be appalled at the idea of Boris Johnson returning as prime minister.
Speculation has grown over whether the former PM would join the race, although Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy declined to comment on the matter.
Meanwhile, Scottish Labour said a general election was ""inevitable"".
Commons leader Penny Mordaunt is so far the only contender to have officially launched a leadership campaign following the resignation of Liz Truss.
Rishi Sunak has become the first potential Tory candidate to secure backing from the 100 MPs needed to enter the race, while Boris Johnson has flown back to the UK following his Caribbean holiday.
Supporters have publicly rallied behind the ex-prime minister.
However, Ian Blackford said it would be ""beyond the pale"" for him to return given the Partygate scandal, during which Mr Johnson become the first prime minister to receive a criminal penalty while in office.
Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, the Mr Blackford said: ""It is almost beyond belief that the Conservatives would even consider this.
""You really have to question what the Conservatives are thinking if they think it is reasonable and rational to bring this man back into some kind of leadership contest. We don't want Boris Johnson anywhere near power.""
Confirming that the SNP are preparing for a general election, he added: ""It shouldn't just be down to Tory MPs and Tory members to pick the next prime minister.""
ry leadership hopefuls have until 14:00 BST on Monday to find 100 MP backers. If any candidate reaches 158 nominations out of the 357 Tory MPs the race will be reduced to two candidates, as there will not be enough MPs left to support a third candidate.
It will then go to an online ballot of the Conservative party membership, with the result to be announced on Friday.
But if the party's MPs get behind just one candidate, there could be a new prime minister by Monday afternoon.
Scottish Conservative Party chairman Craig Hoy refused to comment on the prospect that Mr Johnson could run in the contest.
Mr Hoy told Good Morning Scotland: ""In relation to myself as party chairman, it would be inappropriate for me to engage in speculation about candidates.""
However, he said a general election would be a ""huge distraction"" at a time when stability was needed.
""What we need now is stability for the good of the country, so that the UK government can help people through the difficult times ahead and start to rebuild our public services,"" he said.
With a new prime minister due to be installed by Friday, Mr Hoy said he hoped ""the party unites behind that candidate and we can move forward"".
But Scottish Labour's Daniel Johnson said a general election ""may be necessitated by events"" as he too decried the possible return of Mr Johnson.
He said: ""With Boris Johnson, I think we're headed for a full-blown crisis.

Speaking about the situation the UK is now in, the Labour MSP added: ""The country's paralysed.

politics	Labour MP Ian Byrne reselected as Liverpool West Derby candidate	"An MP who had faced a battle to be chosen to represent Labour at the next election has been reselected as the party's candidate.
Ian Byrne, who has represented Liverpool West Derby since 2019, was announced as the winner of a ballot on Sunday. 
He had had to compete for the seat after losing a series of votes in local constituency branches.
Mr Byrne and the Labour Party have been approached for a comment by the BBC.
MP had faced competition from Liverpool councillor Anthony Lavelle and Lancashire councillor Kimberley Whitehead.
During the contest, he accused Mr Lavelle's supporters of ""intimidation"", a claim which was strongly denied by the councillor's backers.
Mr Byrne was first selected to replace the previous Labour MP Stephen Twigg in early 2019.
At the time, he was a local ward councillor in Everton and was a vocal supporter of then-party leader Jeremy Corbyn.
He is a member of the Socialist Campaign Group of backbench Labour MPs and is a familiar face on match days on Merseyside, collecting donations for the charity he set up, Fans Supporting Foodbanks.
In Parliament, he has campaigned for a right to food to be established in law and for the Hillsborough disaster to be added to the national curriculum.
Ian Byrne is part of the Socialist Campaign Group parliamentary caucus of Labour MPs - made up of MPs on the left of the Labour party. 
Some Labour left-wingers, including supporters of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn, have claimed in recent months they are being frozen out of standing for the party at the next general election as Sir Keir Starmer seeks to remake the party in his own image. 
But a Labour spokesperson previously said that the party's ""due diligence is about weeding out candidates who could cause electoral damage"".
However, the fact Mr Byrne was not automatically selected prompted criticism by Labour's left - including the group Momentum, who said that despite ""a deeply flawed trigger ballot process which broke with basic principles of fairness"", he had ""roared back to victory"".
""also struck a blow... against an out-of-control Starmer machine willing to break Labour's own rules, disregard trade unions and attack its own MPs in the service of their right-wing purge"".

health	Shrewsbury mother proud of new voice after rare cancer	"A woman who lost her voice box to a rare cancer says she is proud of her new one and urges others with the condition not to hide away.
Loren Stokes, from Shrewsbury, had her larynx, thyroid, saliva glands and part of her oesophagus removed to treat a tumour that had grown in her neck.
She now uses a voice prosthesis.
48-year-old dental nurse has been chosen to launch the fundraising campaign Stand Up To Cancer from Cancer Research UK and Channel 4.
Ms Stokes said had she not had the procedure, she would not be here.
She began treatment after being diagnosed with adenoid cystic carcinoma in 2019.
She said she started to have neck and shoulder pain and then could not swallow properly before feeling a lump in her neck move during a doctor's examination.
She said it was ""shocking"" to see the size of the tumour that had grown inside her.
""When I went for my operation,"" she said, ""the consultant surgeon said we've got you at the right time because a couple more weeks it probably would have closed your windpipe off.""
roat cancer symptoms could manifest as asthma, chest or ear infections so it was not commonly picked up, she said.
After her operation she said she felt depressed and regretted having the procedure, but began to feel more positive.
At first she said she felt self-conscious about her new voice but she was now proud of it and encouraged others to be as well.
Ms Stokes talks by pressing a valve in her throat to control airflow. She had to learn how to take in a breath, push it to the bottom of her stomach and back out again.
In October 2020, a routine scan showed the cancer had returned in her lungs which currently was inoperable, but she said she remained positive.
""I just think whatever they can do, I'm grateful for and the time they can give me - they don't know how long I've got,"" she said.
Her 17-year-old son Kieran, who has autism, has been ""brilliant"", she says, after initially struggling with his mother's change.
She said: ""Cancer can affect anyone's life, at any time, so we really have no choice other than to unite against it and help support the scientists to keep making new discoveries.""

sports	Tokyo Olympics: Laura and Jason Kenny win gold medals as son Albie watches from home	"They were already Great Britain's golden couple but Jason and Laura Kenny cemented their place in Olympic history with a gold medal each at Tokyo 2020.
Yet arguably their proudest moment came a year earlier.
Laura posted a video on Instagram in June 2020 of her running carefully alongside their then two-year-old son Albie as he successfully learned to ride a bike.external-link
re two of the strongest track cyclists in the world and they are also the best parents they can be to Albie, who will be four in August.
And, as for any parent trying to find the sweet spot between chasing their dreams and raising their child, it does not always come easily.
""I have never missed you more little man,"" Laura posted alongside an image of Albie watching her on television when she won team pursuit silver on Tuesday - the first time she has missed out on gold at the Olympics.
ree days later she was back on the top of the podium as Laura and Katie Archibald put on a cycling masterclass to dominate the women's madison to become the first British woman to win a gold medal at three Olympics.
On the final day of action, Jason was re-writing history himself as he won a seventh gold medal in a thrilling keirin race, becoming the most successful British Olympian of all time.
When it was announced that both husband and wife would represent GB in Tokyo, Laura said she ""massively underestimated how hard it would be to juggle both being a parent and us both being athletes"".external-link
As the 29-year-old was making her return to the sport after giving birth, an endeavour in which she was supported by fellow mum and Olympic champion Jess Ennis-Hill, she said she had to build her training around Albie rather than the other way round.
ge was made even more difficult by the coronavirus lockdown, meaning the pair could no longer rely on the support of grandparents to help care for Albie while they trained.
But the Kennys are ""tough"", says six-time Olympic champion Sir Chris Hoy.
ughness is what it took for Laura to return from a broken shoulder and arm sustained 18 months before the Games.
It is how Jason, 33, got back to being one of Britain's best after taking a year away from the sport post-Rio.
And toughness has surely been required to do all of that while raising a toddler.
""Albie came along and it just changed everything,"" Laura told the BBC before the Games.
""I just sort of relaxed a lot more. Every time I go home I just switch off. I always thought I wanted to be a young mum and I didn't want to let it get in the way of my career.
""I wanted to prove to myself that I could do both.""
Albie might make the logistics of finding time to train more complicated, but as both aimed to make their mark in the history books he has also provided vital motivation.
""I'd never been injured before, certainly not to that extent,"" she said of the injuries sustained in two major crashes in early 2020.
""It was the hardest couple of weeks in my career because I thought 'why am I doing this?' I do it all for Albie now. I've not sacrificed all this time with him for no reason.""
Jason now has nine medals in total, adding keirin gold and team sprint silver in Tokyo, to surpass Sir Bradley Wiggins, who also has eight in all.
According to data company Nielsen Gracenote, between them the married couple have won a third of all the gold medals claimed by Great Britain in the history of Olympic track cycling.
Sir Chris knows what it takes to achieve such greatness but he never tried to do it while being a parent, instead waiting until he had retired to have children.
""I've got no idea [what that's like],"" he said.
""It adds another dimension to the stress and difficulty that being a parent can bring.
""It balances it out with the joy you get from it and also the perspective. When you are lining up for an Olympic final, perspective is one of the things that can really help you cope with pressure.
""They complement each other. Jason's calmness can settle Laura when she might get a bit nervous or worry about things too much. She drags Jason up and picks his spirits up. They live for their sport and for their little boy Albie. 
""It just makes you so happy to see nice folk succeeding in life.""
Even their relationship has followed Olympic cycles. Laura took to Twitter to announce they were ""dating"" when they were caught kissing on camera at the London 2012 beach volleyball final.
got married after returning from Rio 2016 and Albie was born a year later.
r are now adding a Tokyo chapter to their Olympic story and both Jason and Hoy believe there will be much more to come from Laura at Paris 2024. And Jason hasn't 100% ruled out a fifth Games appearance.
Jason said before the Games his wife would ""trump"" any medal record he sets, adding it ""would be short-lived"".
""In two or three Games' time we will be looking back and Laura could have 10 gold medals,"" Hoy agreed. ""The best is possibly yet to come from Laura. I firmly expect Laura to be standing alone above Jason and above Bradley.""
And Laura may not even be the most successful Kenny, with Albie apparently well on the way in his cycling education.
""He's got a lot of expectation,"" joked Sir Chris.
""The poor lad has got a lot of pressure. He's got to take up something entirely different."""	/sport/olympics/58069122
entertainment	Her Loss: Drake and 21 Savage sued by Vogue publisher	"Drake and 21 Savage are being sued by Vogue's publisher over claims they used the brand name to promote their new album, Her Loss, without permission.
Condé Nast claims the rappers' promo campaign was built ""entirely"" on the unauthorised use of Vogue trademarks and false representations.
It said the musicians created a counterfeit issue of the magazine which they distributed.
In a complaint, the publisher said it's seeking at least $4m (£3.49m).
Larry Stein, the lawyer representing Drake and 21 Savage, has not yet responded to BBC Newsbeat's request for comment.
Condé Nast claims the rappers falsely suggested having the ""love and support"" of Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour.
r complaint says it resulted in ""unmistakable"" confusion, with Drake and 21 Savage being wrongly touted as ""new cover stars"".
""All of this is false. And none of it has been authorised by Condé Nast,"" the legal paperwork says.
It added the rappers' ""flippant disregard"" for the publisher's rights ""have left it with no choice but to commence this action"".
mas Walters, who founded advertising agency Billion Dollar Boy, said the publisher will need to defend itself because the Vogue brand is ""everything"" to the outlet.
""In an era where journalism is consistently being used for free, people aren't buying magazines anymore, that is their value,"" says Thom.
""From their perspective, 21 Savage and Drake have used that brand without compensating for that investment.""
And if they don't defend it in this instance, Thom says there's a risk ""anyone could start using the Vogue brand"".
Since its release on 4 November, Her Loss has had mixed reviews and has also caused a stir after one track, Circo Loco, appeared to suggest singer Megan Thee Stallion had lied about being shot.
Music publication NME gave the album three stars, saying it was an ""exciting prospect marred by lazy song writing"" and packed with ""cheap misogyny"".
Rolling Stone went a step further, branding the album ""a misfire"".
Condé Nast is seeking at least $4m in damages - or triple Drake and 21 Savage's profits from their album and ""counterfeit"" magazine.
But could this actually work out well for Drake and 21 Savage? Thom thinks so.
""I think Drake and 21 Savage are certainly going to benefit from doing this,"" he says. ""Probably more so than the amount than the lawsuit is claiming.
""When you're a star of the calibre of Drake, you know that you're willing to take the risk. They obviously would have seen a bigger upside here than downside.""

business	Energy companies' customer service hits record low	"Customer service standards at energy companies have fallen to a record low as households are being hit by soaring bills, Citizens Advice has said.
Standards have ""plummeted"" since June 2021 when several suppliers went bust due to high global gas prices, it said.
rage waiting time on the phone to speak to a firm is now about six and a half minutes, compared to just under four minutes the year before.
Citizens Advice called for improvements before bills rise again in the autumn.
rgy price cap, which limits how much suppliers can raise the cost of household bills, went up by an unprecedented £700 a year to £1,971 in April for the typical household. Bills are expected to rise by a further £800 a year in October.
rise in bills is down to wholesale gas prices soaring in recent months. Demand increased as economies reopened following Covid restrictions, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has fuelled fears over supplies, pushing prices up further. 
rease in the wholesale cost of gas - the price at which energy companies buy it - caught many suppliers out and meant they were losing money on price promises to customers. This led to several, mostly smaller, firms going bust and millions of customers being shifted to new suppliers.
Between January and March 2022, Citizens Advice said its consumer service helpline saw more than 70,000 cases related to energy issues - a 63% increase on the same period the previous year.
rity said it was ""particularly worried"" about people on prepayment meters, who it said are at risk of having no gas or electricity if they can't afford to top up.
It warned that ""without swift action"" to tackle poor customer service, standards ""will only worsen when bills are expected to hike again this winter"".
Energy suppliers are obliged to help people who cannot afford their bills.
""At a time when customers need all the support they can get, it's worrying to see service performance is the worst on record,"" said Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice.
""This leaves people frustrated and in the dark at the end of the phone.
""We recognise call centre staff are working incredibly hard to answer as many calls as possible, but energy companies must do better.""
Citizens Advice said companies were also getting slightly slower to respond to emails. On average, suppliers responded to 62% of emails within two working days, compared with 66% during the same period in 2021. 
rity ranked energy suppliers through its ""star rating"" after looking at information from a number of sources, including its complaints to its consumer service and the energy ombudsman.
It ranked Utilita, Ovo Energy, Ecotricity and E.On Energy as the four worst performing suppliers for customer service.
Utilita, which was rated the worst of all, said it had ""issues"" with Citizens Advice's approach to recording complaints, ""regardless of whether we are at fault"".
""Yet again, the Citizens Advice Star Rating fails to reflect neither the unique nature of our business nor the service our customers receive,"" a spokesman said.
It accused Citizens Advice of not adjusting its records to reflect ""where the supplier has done nothing wrong, and we have had no contact with the customer"".
""We acknowledge that we can do better, but we strongly believe Citizens Advice employs a methodology that is unfairly weighted against us as a smart prepay specialist.""
E.On said it had seen an ""unprecedented spike"" in contact from customers during the months ahead of the April price change and apologised to ""any customer who feels our service fell short around this time"".
Ecotricity founder Dale Vince said Citizens Advice's numbers ""do not represent our current performance"".
He said since the statistics were recorded, the company had recruited more staff to cope with higher demand.
Ofgem, the UK's energy regulator, said it was working with suppliers to improve service, adding that ""now is the time for them to up their game"".
""Our top priority is to protect consumers, and as these stats from Citizens Advice show, there are areas where customers are simply not getting the service they desperately need and rightly expect in these very difficult times,"" it said.
""We are clear with suppliers - they must not use the current gas crisis as an excuse for poor performance or sharp practices."""	/news/business-62008383

politics	Wales' education: Teacher pressure sparks staffing fears	"Increasing pressure on teachers could lead to a ""crisis"" in staffing, a teaching union has said.
One head teacher said experienced staff had already quit the profession over long hours, among other issues.
National Headteachers Union Cymru said below-inflation pay awards were compounding the problem.
Education Minister Jeremy Miles told Wales Live he did not ""have the resources"" to increase pay beyond the 5% rise offered in July.
Louise Jones, head teacher at Maes y Morfa Primary Community School in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, said she regularly spoke to colleagues about concerns over the retention of experienced teaching staff.
She said they were concerned about the demands of the new curriculum, speaking Welsh, having the right digital skills and a new code of practice.
""The teachers that are leaving are the best teachers because they've done it for so long,"" she said.
""The salary doesn't compensate them for what they do and the hours are long.
Ms Jones added that teachers were not just learning supporters, but responsible for supporting with health, supporting with counselling and wellbeing, as well as also being obliged to support with healthcare, nursing and brushing teeth.
""Everything that used to be done by other professionals is now being pushed into the direction of teaching.
""We've lost teachers, not necessarily in this school, but in a school a stone's throw away.""
She said prior to Covid she would have had 27 applications for a learning support assistant role and the most recent recruiting round, this has dropped to five.
Laura Doel, head of the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru, said that while recruitment and retention had been an issue in Wales for a while, below-inflation pay awards were compounding it.
""We know from speaking to our own members that below-inflation pay awards continue to compound the recruitment crisis.""
Ms Doel said that, anecdotally, they had also heard that teachers were not staying in the profession after training. 
Gareth Evans, the director of education policy at University of Wales Trinity St Davids, said teacher retention and recruitment is an issue across Wales, and in fact the UK.
Speaking with BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Evans said he believes there is a looming crisis, if not one already.
""Education isn't immune from challenges facing the rest of the public sectors; shrinking budgets, scarcity of resources, fewer staff, the cost of living crisis, pay awards well below inflation, throw in legitimate work flow concerns related to the new curriculum and I think a hangover from Covid with it, and I do think we have something of a challenging situation on our hands.
""It's perhaps little wonder that teachers are in some cases reconsidering their positions and those seeking to become teachers are potentially looking for other jobs, but I don't think it's all doom and gloom by a long stretch and we must remember the positives.""
Mr Evans said the positives included competitive starting salaries, strong career development opportunities and having the power to change a child's life for the better.
""I think really what we need to do in Wales is change the narrative.
""The Welsh government, trade unions, and even teachers themselves on occasion are all guilty of perhaps selling a more negative picture of the profession when I think we could all do a slightly better job of selling the positives.""
Cameron Stewart leads on recruitment and retention for teachers education in partnership with Cardiff Met and said there was a big difference in what is happening at primary schools and secondary schools 
""Primary recruitment is very strong secondary is a different picture altogether unfortunately, we have some subject areas that are recruiting really well like P.E for example, but some of our science or our modern foreign language pathways are numbers are not where we need them and not where our profession needs them.
""And in Welsh medium, this is far lower in both primary and secondary than the demand requires.""
Mr Stewart said it was a positive move for the Welsh government to change the grade from a B to a C.
""It's much needed to tackle the crisis that we are facing in our secondary schools and in our Welsh medium provision and personally I feel there will be no impact on quality.
""I have had to turn away people in the past who didn't have the grade, who would have been great, so thinks it's a positive step forward and actually aligns us with the entry requirements for England.""
Welsh government said official figures showed teacher recruitment and retention remained stable.
It has also announced ""more incentives"" to join the profession, including reducing GCSE grade requirements from a B to a C in English or Welsh and Maths for teacher training.
Welsh government's new incentives include paying eligible student teachers a larger amount after their first term rather than at the end of their induction period.
It said it also recognised there was more to do but added there was a significantly lower ""leaving rate"" among secondary teachers in Wales compared to England."	/news/uk-wales-63800954
technology	Is it goodbye - finally - to the fax machine?	"fax machine is about to be pushed closer to the dustbin of history.
- formally known as a facsimile machine - was once a regular feature of British offices. 
But now the UK's communications regulator Ofcom is consulting on changes to telecoms rules that could formalise its obsolescence.
It would mean telecoms providers would no longer be required to provide fax services under the universal service obligation (USO).
""We're proposing changes to the rules"" Ofcom said.
Currently there are two designated telecoms providers responsible for universal service in the UK - BT and KCOM (in the Hull area only).
In 2003, Ofcom set up the USO, when fax machines were more prevalent and not so many people were connected by email and online messaging services. 
USO required BT and KCOM to provide fax services.
Ofcom said: ""Not only are alternatives to fax machines now more widely available, migration of telephone networks to internet protocol (IP) technology means fax services can no longer be guaranteed to work in the same way.""
regulator consulted widely on this last year: ""We considered it was appropriate for fax to be removed from the USO, given its limited ongoing use."" 
Millions of faxes have been sent and received over the years, some becoming landmarks in our communications history.

f the reasons they were used in big-money transactions with tight deadlines, such as house sales, as they enabled contracts to be exchanged quickly and accurately.
Footballers' agents used faxing to secure the transfer of players, although the method has been retired by the Premier League.
Clubs now have the option of sending desktop faxes and scanned documents via email.
Basketball player Michael Jordan was responsible for one of the most famous faxes in sporting history in 1995, when he sent the message ""I'm back""  to the Chicago Bulls to let them know he was coming out of retirement. 
In recent years faxes have become more limited in use although are still working in some professions like medical administration, law enforcement and conveyancing. 
According to reports a few hundred fax machines are still in use within the NHS. 
In 2018 there was an immediate ban on the health service buying them, with the aim of phasing them out by 2020. 
At the time it was reported that many hospitals were still reliant on the machines, with thousands still in use.
Ofcom expects to publish a statement about the changes in early 2023."	/news/technology-63472371
business	Kingfisher tycoon Vijay Mallya sentenced to jail in India	"India's top court has sentenced tycoon Vijay Mallya to four months in jail for disobeying an earlier court judgement linked to the collapse of his airline.
India has previously made efforts to extradite the former billionaire, who is believed to still be in London.
He made his fortune selling beer under the Kingfisher brand before branching out into aviation and Formula 1 racing.
Kingfisher Airlines was India's second largest domestic carrier before it collapsed a decade ago.
On Monday, India's Supreme Court found Mr Mallya guilty of contempt, as it said he failed to disclose his assets after defaulting on a loan.
He was found guilty of the same offence in 2017 for allegedly transferring $40m to his children, even as loans to Kingfisher Airlines remained unpaid, the court said at that time.
Known as the ""king of good times"", in a reference to his lavish lifestyle, Mr Mallya has fought extradition from the UK to India, where he faces charges including fraud.
Mr Mallya who left India in 2016 after defaulting on debts of more than $1bn (£842m), has denied fleeing the country.
Late in 2018, a court in London ruled that he could be extradited from the UK to India to face charges there.
In 2020, Mr Mallya lost his final appeal against his extradition at the High Court in London. However, he is still believed to be living in London.
Mr Mallya faces a number of charges related to alleged financial irregularities at Kingfisher Airlines.

business	First-time buyers hit by drop in mortgage deals	"First-time house buyers could find it more difficult to get onto the property ladder due to fewer mortgage deals with smaller deposits being on offer.
Figures from research body Moneyfacts show there were 137 mortgage offers at 95% loan-to-value on Monday, compared to 347 at the start of 2022.
wnward trend of such deals was accelerated after the mini-budget sparked turmoil on the markets.
Mortgage interest rates hit 14-year highs, but have since begun to fall.
Eleanor Williams , a finance expert at research body Moneyfacts, said first-time buyers were likely to feel the impact of the current climate ""keenly"" due to them often having smaller deposits and therefore  favouring 95% loan-to-value mortgages.
On Monday, Moneyfacts said there were 137 95% loan-to-value mortgage products, compared to 283 on the day of the government's mini-budget.
""The mortgage sector is changeable at the moment, with the level of product choice fluctuating as lenders review their offerings and try to keep up with a changing economic outlook, which has meant that there are fewer products to choose from than there were prior to the recent fiscal announcement,"" Ms Williams added.
She said that with the cost of living biting into household budgets, buyers looking for a low-deposit mortgage deal would also have concerns about meeting affordability requirements.
Mortgage rates in general have been rising for months as central banks across the world try to tackle rising inflation, which is currently at 10.1% in the UK.
But when the financial markets reacted badly to government's mini-budget last month, which promised billions of pounds of unfunded tax cuts, UK rates rose even higher.
Lenders also suspended hundreds of mortgage products amid uncertainty over how to price these long term loans.
Moneyfacts said the number of all types of mortgage deals available in the UK had recovered slightly to 3,067 - down from 3,961 on the morning of then Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's statement.
On Monday, the largest number of deals from lenders was for 75% loan-to-value mortgages (583), the research said.
ure could change again, with the Bank of England expected to raise interest rates again in November in an attempt to bring down the current rate of inflation.
Average two-and five-year fixed rates are currently at 6.55% and 6.43% respectively, levels not seen since the financial crisis of 2008. 
At least 100,000 mortgage holders a month are coming to the end of fixed-rate deals, and face steep rises in monthly repayments.

technology	EE to block pirate music mobile sites and apps	"EE is to become the first UK mobile network to block access to pirate music websites.
Industry body the British Phonographic Institute (BPI) successfully petitioned the courts to block file-sharing site The Pirate Bay in 2012.
High Court subsequently ordered broadband providers, including EE, to block more than 70 websites which allow people to download music illegally.
EE now plans to extend this ban to its mobile network.
An EE spokesperson said: ""Historically the majority of piracy took place on fixed line networks, but as network speeds increase and content file sizes for music decreases, mobile networks are seeing a rise in piracy. EE believe in supporting content creators by combatting piracy across both our mobile and fixed networks.""
Vodafone, Three, and O2 have been approached for comment.
Online piracy costs the record industry £200m a year, the BPI says.
Kiaron Whitehead, a lawyer for the BPI, said: ""A quarter of people now connect to the internet over 3G, 4G and 5G rather than broadband and wi-fi.
""That growth brings with it the risk of increased music piracy.
""The operators of these pirate sites make millions of pounds a year, without a penny going to the creators of the music they exploit. 
""We are therefore pleased that EE - which was the first mobile network to launch 5G to the UK population - has now become the first mobile network to block pirate sites.""
But Chris Elkins, co-founder and chief business development officer at Muso, a data company measuring unlicensed demand for digital content, told BBC News combating piracy was about more than simply blocking websites. 
""One of the things we've found is there needs to be a combination of legal effort and site blocking,"" he said. 
""Website blocking is really important... it needs to become routine and more cost-effective, and part of the arsenal that all media companies can utilise.
""And the legal offer - such as Spotify - is an example of a really positive service that has engaged consumers.
""It's about enforcing, making sure the piracy is harder to find, and creating stronger and stronger legal offers that the audience can engage with."""	/news/technology-62123815
health	Midwives in Scotland reject latest NHS pay offer	"Members of the union representing midwives in Scotland have rejected the latest NHS pay offer. 
Royal College of Midwives (RCM) said 65% of members voted against it. The union will now consider next steps including possible industrial action. 
NHS offered an average pay increase of 7.5%. It was accepted by Unison and Unite members but rejected by the GMB.
Scottish government has said the proposal was unprecedented at a time of ""extraordinary financial challenges"".
Royal College of Nursing has also rejected the pay offer and said it would soon announce dates for strikes. 
Jaki Lambert, RCM director for Scotland, said: ""Our members have spoken loud and clear - the latest pay offer by the Scottish government is simply not good enough. It goes nowhere near addressing the rising cost of living and would see many midwives actually worse off in real terms.
""Our members have been consistent throughout this process - they want a decent deal, and they are prepared to take industrial action to get one. 
""No midwife wants to do this and it is for the Scottish government to make sure that they do not feel that they are left with no other option. 
""While we acknowledge that the Scottish government has listened to some of the concerns regarding career opportunities and development, it has failed to meet our members' needs on pay.""
Last month, Holyrood ministers tabled an improved pay offer averaging 7.5% to health workers threatening industrial action.
Annual salary rises under the proposal would range from a flat rate payment of £2,205 for staff in Bands 1 to 4 and up to £2,660 for staff in Bands 5 to 7, backdated to April. 
represents an increase of 11.3% for the lowest paid workers and delivers an average uplift of 7.5%.
Unite and Unison chose to accept the deal, however, the GMB union became the first to reject it last week.
Scottish government said previously that the pay offer was unprecedented for front-line employees and would ensure NHS workers in Scotland remain the best paid in the UK.
RCM is part of the Scottish Terms and Conditions Committee (STAC), which negotiates pay deals with the Scottish government. STAC staff will meet with ministers on Thursday to share the outcomes of their respective consultations, the RCM said. "	/news/uk-scotland-64050826
technology	Meta, Amazon, Twitter layoffs: 'Tech layoffs won't destroy American dreams of Indians’	"Many Indians who work on temporary visas in the US are facing an uncertain future after mass layoffs at big tech firms. Surbhi Gupta, who lost her job at Meta, tells her story of in her own words.
It was my mum's birthday. I was staying up late to wish her and that's when I started getting messages from my friends about layoff announcements. They were all anxious.
At around 6am here, I received an email that I'd been let go. I had joined Meta earlier this year as a product manager. My team was shocked because I'd been performing really well.
It went against my motto, work is worship, instilled early by my favourite teacher at school. Initially, it felt like the Titanic sinking because I was losing access to things one by one - workplace, then email, then laptop. But I was pleasantly overwhelmed and surprised in a positive way by my network on LinkedIn. Many colleagues, ex-colleagues and friends reached out in a very supportive way, making introductions and referrals. It made me feel like I have so many people in this country who care for me, made me feel like I belong to this country.
My last day at Meta is in January and my H1-B visa [a non-immigrant visa that allows firms in the US to hire foreigners for up to six years] allows me to stay in the US for another 60 days, so early March is the deadline for me to find another job. 
job search is going to be difficult now as hiring will be slow in December because of the holidays. But I'm very focused. I am in touch with multiple companies and exploring options.
What I'll miss most about Meta is the workplace and my colleagues. Being at Meta meant not only being able to build an amazing product for millions of people, but also being able to participate in fireside chats and growth and learning opportunities. As a product manager, it would have been rewarding to see the project I was working on go further.
My parents taught me to never give up in life. They tell me to stay strong because I'm a person who can convert problems into opportunities. They tell me 'aur kuch accha mil jayega' [you'll find something better].
But my ability to work and stay in the US depends on my H1-B visa. I moved to the US in 2009 and I have worked very hard to build my career on my own strength and intellect. I have worked in prominent companies like Tesla, Intuit, etc., built great products, got top ratings, paid taxes, and contributed to the US economy for more than 15 years, but I feel that I am in the same place as far as permanent residency goes because of the limitations of the H1-B. I was crowned Miss Bharat California [a beauty pageant] by my idol, Bollywood actress Sushmita Sen. I have walked the ramp at New York Fashion Week. I have my own podcast. 
We face unnecessary stress because the US has a country cap which takes forever for Indian H1-B holders to get a green card (permanent residency). Even though I am in the green card queue, when I track my status, I sometimes get a wait-time of two decades, and at other times, 60 years.
Our personal life suffers because of the uncertainty. Buying a home has been a question mark in my mind - do I invest in a home and then what if I have to leave. In spite of having gone ahead with the YC [Y Combinator is an American technology start-up accelerator], I can't start a company even though I have a great idea because I don't have a green card.
I travelled to 30 countries before turning 30 years old, but now I'm unable to travel much, even though it's my dream to travel the world, because I'm nervous about facing problems while trying to get my H1-B visa re-stamped. I have heard from my friends who work at great companies like Google and PayPal about getting stuck abroad.
I have even curtailed my travels home to India. A few years back, I got stuck in India. I had gone to attend a wedding and I had to get my H1-B visa stamped. But that took several months as it went into random administrative processing and I wasn't even sure when it would come through. The uncertainty and the wait caused problems in my marriage. The visa issues had a very big role in my marriage. It was not the only reason, but it became one of the major reasons for the break-up of my marriage. I also had to drop out of a semester at New York University, where I was studying at the time, because I didn't know when I would be able to return to the US. Why do people on H1-Bs have to deal with this?
I have not met my parents since the Covid-19 pandemic because they haven't been able to come to visit me for three-and-a-half years. They are elderly, and don't keep too well. I constantly think - if my parents need support, will I be able to go to help them? Nobody realises how it impacts our life.
But despite whatever has happened, I believe this experience too has a silver lining. Spirituality is a significant part of my life. I am a believer and follower of Sadhguru ji [as followers refer to Indian yoga guru Jaggi Vasudev]. He says that we should not be identified only by or limit our identity to our professional role. In Silicon Valley, the most frequently asked question is - Which company do you work for? But I am still me, not just a product manager. Everyone should realise that they are more than just the company they work for.

business	Average two-year mortgage rate highest for 14 years	"rest rate on a typical two-year fixed rate mortgage has breached 6% for the first time in 14 years.
rate of 6.07%, the financial information service Moneyfacts says, a level not seen since the financial crisis in November 2008. 
Mortgage rates have been going up for months, but recorded a sharp increase in response to the fall-out from the mini-budget nearly two weeks ago.
First-time buyers and those looking to remortgage are affected.
An average of at least 100,000 people a month are coming to the end of their current mortgage, and face a significant rise in their monthly repayments.
""Borrowers may well be concerned about the rise to fixed mortgage rates but it is essential they seek advice to assess the deals that are available to them right now,"" said Rachel Springall from Moneyfacts.
""Fixing for longer may seem more appealing, particularly as both the average two- and five-year fixed rates rise to levels not seen in over a decade. Consumers must carefully consider whether now is the right time to buy a home or to wait and see how things change in the coming weeks.""
Brokers say lenders are ""playing safe"" with rates amid current economic uncertainty, but costs could eventually start to dip.
Uncertainty over future interest rates after the mini-budget led lenders to pull more than a thousand deals from the market. 
re slowly starting to return - there were 3,961 products a fortnight ago, now there are 2,371 - but have become more expensive on average.
Representatives from High Street banks and mortgage lenders are meeting Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng on Thursday, with the current situation facing borrowers on the agenda. It is understood that this is the latest in a regular series of discussions.
Bosses from Barclays, Natwest and Lloyds Banking Group are expected to attend.
rest rate on a new, average two-year fixed deal on the morning of the speech was 4.74%, compared with 6.07% now. That is a difference of about £170 a month on repayments for somebody borrowing £200,000 on a 30-year mortgage.
A five-year fixed deal has typically risen from 4.75% to 5.97% over the same period.
will be much greater when compared to a borrower's previous deal taken out two or five years ago.
Some more specialist lenders, whose customers may include those with a chequered credit history or the recently self-employed, have been raising rates to 6.5-7% or more.
In the meantime, the average standards variable rate - which by nature are changeable and are paid by 900,000 homeowners - has gone up from 4.41% at the start of the year to 5.63% at the start of October.
During her speech at the Conservative Party conference, Prime Minister Liz Truss said that the government ""will do what we can"" to support homeowners. However, she said that the benchmark interest rate was set independently by the Bank of England."	/news/business-63144506

health	East Midlands Ambulance Service faces unprecedented demand - director	"An ambulance service has experienced ""unprecedented"" demand this year, a director said.
East Midlands Ambulance Service has been preparing for winter by hiring additional call handlers and bringing in new ambulances.
Divisional director for Northamptonshire, Mick Jones, said he had ""never seen such demand"" in his 35 years at the service.
He said the past year had been ""exceptionally busy"".
rvice, which covers Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Nottinghamshire and Rutland, would usually see a reduction in demand in the summer, but that had not been the case this year, Mr Jones said.
""Staff have shown their resilience,"" he said.
""This winter really is more important than ever.""
rough the busier winter months, the service is receiving 110 new ambulances to replace older vehicles, with 24 of those based in Northamptonshire.
Mr Jones said the service was aiming for its fleet to have an average age of three years.
""It means it's a nicer place to work in for our staff, more comfortable for our patients and more reliable,"" he said.
In Northamptonshire, there would also be two welfare vehicles for staff which would provide hot drinks and a place to have a break during their shifts.
Mr Jones said in the past few weeks there had been a ""large improvement"" in the time it takes for crews to be released when handing patients over to hospitals.
""We don't have an infinite supply of resources so it's really important our crews are released so they can respond to other calls,"" he said.
Mr Jones said the service spends a lot of time preparing for the increased demand during the winter months.
""With the plans we have put in place and with the excellent staff we have, I think we should be OK,"" he said.

ms from the Portland Collection include rare Tudor and Jacobean portraits, jewellery and tapestries.
will make up an exhibition which is to open at Welbeck Abbey, in Nottinghamshire, next year.
ried collection was acquired over centuries by the Cavendish family which has owned the Welbeck Estate since the 17th Century.
Highlights of the exhibition, set up by the Harley Foundation, include a Michelangelo painting - Madonna of Silence - and the pearl earring worn by King Charles I at his execution after the English Civil War.
Parts of the collection are being recalled from loans to museums around the country to make up the exhibition but organisers said many items had never been on display before.
Director of The Harley Foundation Lisa Gee described the collection as ""world class"" - particularly the portraits.
She said: ""Historic portraits were almost always flattering, filtered images which are like the social media of their day but behind the gleaming fabrics and jewels were fully rounded individuals.
""Despite their starched clothing, they were as human as we are.""
Also going on display are 17th Century silver wine fountains made for William of Orange before he became King of England and a series of tapestries.
Unseen Treasures of The Portland Collection will open on 25 March, 2023 and will run for three years.
