politics	UK faces tougher austerity era - ex-Bank chief	"UK faces a ""more difficult"" era of austerity than the one after the 2008 financial crisis in order to stabilise the economy, a former governor of the Bank of England has warned.
Lord Mervyn King said the average person could face ""significantly higher taxes"" to fund public spending.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt is scheduled to set out his economic plans on 31 October.
He has already scrapped almost all the tax cuts announced under Liz Truss.
Mr Hunt has said: ""This government will take the difficult decisions necessary to ensure there is trust and confidence in our national finances.
""That means decisions of eye-watering difficulty.""
Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Lord King said that ""it is time to front up"" with the public about the difficulties the country is facing.
He said ""public expenditure isn't going down, if anything it will go up therefore taxes will have to rise to fill the gap which is there at present"".
""That doesn't make a very happy picture for the next few years,"" said Lord King. 
""But what we need is a government that will actually tell us honestly there is a reduction in our national standard of living because we've decided to help Ukraine and confront Russia and that means that all of us are going to have to share the burden, we can't just put all of it on our children and grandchildren.""
After the 2007-2008 financial crisis, when the banking sector came close to collapse, the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government announced the sharpest cuts in public spending since the end of World War Two. 
Asked if the UK could be facing a similar period of austerity, Lord King, who was governor at the time, said: ""In some ways it could be more difficult.""
He said: ""The challenge is if we want European levels of welfare payments and public spending, you cannot finance that with American levels of tax rates, so we may need to confront the need to have significantly higher taxes on the average person.
""There isn't enough money there among the rich to get it back."" 
Mr Hunt has reversed nearly all the tax cuts set out in September's mini-budget. This included a 1p cut in income tax which was due in April. A decision to cut the top rate of tax for people earning £150,000 or more had already been scrapped. 
Uncertainty remains, however, about public spending, as the Conservative Party undertakes another leadership race to choose a leader and prime minister to replace Ms Truss.  
Last week, Ms Truss said she was committed to a Tory manifesto pledge in 2019, made by the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson,  to raise pensions in line with prices.   
riple lock means state pension payments rise by whatever is higher - inflation, average earnings or 2.5%.
On Sunday, Rishi Sunak declared he was in the running to take over as Tory leader and prime minister and said he would ""deliver on the promise of the 2019 manifesto"". 
Leadership rival Penny Mordaunt said: ""We have a majority and a mandate to deliver a true 2019 manifesto."" Mr Johnson is also expected to announce his candidacy, according to Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg but is yet to make a formal statement.
On Sunday, Lord King also reiterated criticism of central banks for failing to curb inflation which is now running at a 40-year high of 10.1%. 
He said major central banks, including the Bank of England, had continued to ""print money"" - through a measure known as quantitative easing - to support their economies during Covid lockdowns. This, he said, had contributed to rising inflation.
Lord King was governor of the Bank of England between 2003 and 2013 during which time it launched quantitative easing. But he said there was a difference between that period when major economies were dealing with the global financial crisis and the impact of Covid lockdowns. 
""Engaging in quantitative easing in 2009 was to stop the economy from going into another recession because the amount of money in the economy was going down,"" he said.
""Here in the last couple of years the amount of money in the economy has grown very rapidly and at a pace that was bound to lead to higher inflation."""	/news/business-63364240
business	Newport plant critical to easing microchip shortage, says boss	"A south Wales factory could prove ""critical"" to addressing the global shortage of semiconductors.
Welsh company IQE produces wafers for a range of electronic devices around the world.
Apple iPhones are understood to be among the devices that use parts made at the plant in Newport.
mpany's new chief executive, Americo Lemos, said ""time is of the essence"" to expand capacity once funding is in place.
He has begun discussions with Welsh and UK governments about funding its expansion, while private backing is also being pursued.
""Newport is critical. We are building products here that go all around the globe [for] different types of technologies, different types of end-product that really enhance people's lives,"" said Mr Lemos.
""And this is what I'm excited about. As we grow the site here, with the right investment level, we will be able to proliferate our product all around the world.""
Semiconductors, also known as microchips or chips, allow electricity to flow through devices and are the fundamental components of everything from smart phones to the vast data centres powering the internet.
However, supplies have been restricted since the Covid pandemic, with some manufacturers cancelling or delaying products as they wait for the vital components to be produced.
IQE's Newport site, based at the former LG factory in Duffryn, has vast unoccupied areas which the company says can be quickly utilised to expand production.
Mr Lemos said he hoped government funding would come quickly.
""The semiconductor shortage has impacted a very large part of the economy, like the automotive [sector] and all those areas of our daily lives,"" he said.
""Therefore, the cost of not having those products is much higher than the investment needed to make it happen.""
Welsh government welcomed IQE's plans to expand, adding: ""There needs to be a clear and coherent approach to the semiconductor industry in the UK, this will need governments to work together and with the sector.""
Newport is home to several companies that are collectively known as the semiconductor cluster.
IQE, established in the 1980s, produces a type of epitaxy wafer in Newport which is a vital component of compound semiconductors.
""The stuff that we make here we will be impacting your life on a daily basis,"" said Mr Lemos.
UK government has ordered a security review into Chinese influence on the semiconductor sector following the takeover of Newport Wafer Fab by Nexperia, a Dutch company owned by Shanghai firm Wingtech.
""We all understand the geopolitical tensions we live in,"" Mr Lemos said.
""But we are a global company and we intend to work in every market possible where there is business, within the framework that exists today. 
""So I'm more excited than nervous, actually, for the future of the company here and the site we are in."""	/news/uk-wales-61587091
technology	London Underground: Five Tube stations to get 4G coverage	"London Underground passengers at five major Tube stations will have access to 4G within six months, Transport for London (TfL) has said.
Bank, Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Euston and Camden Town will gain coverage following a pilot scheme on the eastern end of the Jubilee line.
All major mobile phone networks have signed up to provide coverage across the Tube network, TfL said. 
Sadiq Khan said the scheme was ""central to London's economic recovery"".
London's mayor added: ""I committed to Londoners that I would deliver 4G throughout the Tube network as part of my determination to build a better London for everyone - and I have no doubt that this will transform journeys for millions of passengers.""
fL has awarded a 20-year deal to 4G and 5G infrastructure company BAI Communications to counter the so called ""not-spots"" on the Tube.
work will eventually support a 4G and 5G rollout and will be the most advanced of its kind in the world, TfL said.
Once complete, customers will be able to make calls and access the internet wherever they are in the five stations.
Mobile phone reception has been available on the eastern half of the Jubilee line since March 2021.
month Vodafone and Virgin Media O2 joined Three and EE as part of the BAI Communications scheme, meaning the four major phone networks have signed up. 
Mobile coverage on underground sections of the Tube had only previously been available while a short trial was taking place on the Waterloo and City line during summer in 2017.
BAI has pledged to invest more than £1bn on establishing a backbone of mobile and digital connectivity for London. 
Further sections of Tube network, including stations across the City and West End on the Central line, will go live by summer 2023, TfL said.

politics	Security minister Tom Tugendhat denies using phone while driving	"Security minister and Tory MP Tom Tugendhat has denied using his phone while driving his car.
He was spotted in Wandsworth High Street on 4 April by Met Police officer PC Joseph Robson, who pulled him over.
In a written guilty plea, the Tonbridge and Malling MP said he was holding the phone but not using it and had later taken a driving course.
His case has been sent for a full hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court to consider disqualification.
Met had sent the MP a conditional offer of a fixed penalty notice and Mr Tugendhat agreed to pay the fine and surrender his licence, court papers showed.
ffence was sent to court because the politician already had six points on his record.
Bromley Magistrates' Court heard the case in private under the single justice procedure.
In his guilty plea, Mr Tugendhat wrote: ""I was holding my phone - not using it. After the incident I took a course to refresh and correct my driving.
""I accept my responsibility and recognise my culpability.""
report assessed the MP as low risk and said: ""Thomas does not come across as a fast driver who likes to rush, in fact, Thomas is very calm and handles situations accordingly.
""Thomas is a well-balanced driver and is interested in reaching his destination safely.""
Mr Tugendhat stood for Conservative Party leadership after Boris Johnson stepped down as prime minister. He became a minister in September.
In a statement, PC Robson said he had noticed a driver using a handheld device and said: ""I stopped the vehicle and spoke with the driver. I confirmed they weren't making emergency contact to the 999 service. I pointed out the offence where they confirmed the communication was using maps.""
A spokesman for Mr Tugendhat said: ""He apologises unreservedly and will accept the outcome of the case.""
It is understood Mr Tugendhat informed the Home Office permanent secretary about the offence after he became a minister.

politics	Energy payments: Rishi Sunak promises NI £600 update shortly	"Rishi Sunak says the £600 energy support payments will be made this winter
Households in Northern Ireland will receive their £600 energy support payment this winter, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has insisted.
His comment comes after Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said energy firms had suggested it could take until June for all households to receive the payment.
Mr Sunak did not say when the discount would be applied to bills but said an announcement would come ""very shortly"".
He was speaking during his first visit to Northern Ireland since becoming PM.
re has been continued uncertainty about a due date the energy support payments in Northern Ireland, the first of which was announced in May.
A £400 payment was initially promised by the UK government for all households to help them to deal with rising prices for gas and electricity.
A further £200 payment was announced last month because of the proportion of homes in Northern Ireland that use home heating oil.
People in Great Britain started benefitting from the support in October.
But last month the UK government said households in Northern Ireland would have to wait until after Christmas to receive the help.
Speaking on Friday morning, Mr Sunak said: ""Everyone in Northern Ireland will receive £600.
""That's more than everyone else in Great Britain because we recognise that many people in Northern Ireland are reliant on heating oil.
""That money will be delivered this winter.""
But Ms Long said energy firms had suggested that the UK government's plan to allow people to ""cash out"" the support they were entitled to would mean the rollout would take much longer than planned.
""[Energy companies] have said they could start to deliver it in January but realistically it would still be being rolled out in June,"" she said.
""It's a shocking admission of the lack of preparation that's gone in to any scheme and it leaves a major gap that I think needs to be filled in terms of crisis payments to get people through the winter.
""Frankly having more money for energy in June isn't really what people need - they need it now when there's snow and frost on the ground.""
Ms Long said Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris had ""pushed back hard"" against that suggestion when she raised it with him on Thursday.
""He felt that wasn't the case, that it would be done more quickly,"" she said.
""But irrespective, we're probably talking at least three to four months until the entire package has been delivered.
""For a lot of people that is going to leave them in a really difficult situation, given that they were told it would be in their account by the end of November at one stage.
""A lot of people have spent money on the strength of thinking that was going to come and it hasn't.""
Asked why the energy payment scheme was so taking so long to resolve, Mr Sunak said the delay demonstrated why it was important to have devolved government at Stormont in place.
""This is one of the things where this is why we need to have an executive back up and running, to deliver on these types of challenges for people,"" he said.
""But we are committed to doing it and it will be done this winter.""
g problem with the £600 energy support scheme is that it is bogged down in logistics.
It's straightforward when it comes to getting the money out to people who pay their electricity bill by direct debit.
But the difficulty seems to be finding a way to provide the financial help to those people who use pre-paid meters.
government does not want to open a scheme that gets money to some people but not to others.
Other options are being considered.
It would not be a surprise if we see a voucher-style scheme, similar to the High Street Voucher that was rolled out by Stormont during the Covid pandemic.
Gordon Lyons of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said he was worried the scheme would be ""far more complex than the government thinks it is"".
""It could be a real mess - Naomi Long could be right,"" he said.
""My fear is that this actually could take months and months before something like this can be delivered and people need support now.""
Sinn Féin MP John Finucane said people in Northern Ireland would have had the £600 ""in our pockets already had there been an executive in place"".
""As temperatures plummet, as the cost of living gets worse on a weekly basis, we need certainty now from the British government on when we are going to get that payment.""
On Thursday night Mr Sunak met the leaders of Stormont's five main parties.
Political leaders said their meetings with Mr Sunak focused on restoring power-sharing, the stalled energy payment scheme and the nurses' strike.
rime minister continued his first visit to Northern Ireland on Friday by visiting the Harland and Wolff shipyard to promote what Downing Street described as the return of naval shipbuilding to Belfast.
A consortium, including Belfast's Harland and Wolff, was chosen for a £1.6bn Ministry of Defence contract to build three new Royal Navy ships."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63995488

""Gordon kindly lent me two of his jumpers for the piece and at that point I knew it was in the can.
""It's a great honour and I am reeling with delight to win this prestigious award - I can now feed my five children this Christmas.""
r's Turnip Prize attracted 69 entries.

Mr Prideaux added: ""All entries still at the pub after Friday 9 December will be thrown in the skip.""

politics	Asylum hotel cancels couple's wedding with five weeks notice	"A couple's wedding has been cancelled by a hotel that is being used to house asylum seekers.
Lucie Campbell and Simon Pritchard booked their wedding for 10 December more than a year ago.
But they were left with just days to find a new venue after discovering the Aberconwy hotel is being used to ease overcrowding at Kent detention centres.
Ms Campbell, 28, of Towyn, Conwy, said she was in ""disbelief"" but has managed to reorganise their special day.
, which the BBC is not naming for safeguarding reasons, is providing short-term accommodation as part of a project that began last week. 
However, it has sparked ""anguish and anger"" among residents living nearby, according to politicians.
Ms Campbell and Mr Pritchard, 33, were told at the weekend that their wedding had been cancelled.
""The hotel manager and wedding coordinator said it was out of their hands. We were just in shock. We didn't really have a response,"" said Ms Campbell.
""I felt awful for them, especially the wedding coordinator as she had to break the news.""
uple, who have three children, had only days to find a new venue due to the 28 days' notice required by the registry office for wedding ceremonies.
""We had to get our heads around it. We had been on countdown and everything was done, all the suppliers booked, hair, make-up, flowers, everything,"" said Ms Campbell.
Despite the shock and a ""few tweaks"" to their plans, the couple will still marry on the same date in Llanrwst, and said they have sympathy for the asylum seekers being housed in the hotel.
Ms Campbell, a support worker, said: ""We are not worse off. We are still getting married and it's an absolutely lovely venue and the staff have been so kind.
""Since it happened, local businesses have reached out offering help, even strangers, telling us to try this place and that. It has proved there are lovely people out there.""
rators of the hotel housing the asylum seekers declined to comment.
Politicians in the area have urged the Home Office to reverse the decision due to the rural location being ""unsuitable"".
Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt said it was ""unacceptable"" the Home Office contracted the hotel without first informing the Welsh government, local council or police.

sports	Nekoda Smythe-Davis on concussion, pregnancy and the mother of all comebacks	"""I didn't know if I'd make it back,"" admits Nekoda Smythe-Davis as a smile breaks across her face. ""After a concussion and having my baby girl, I just wasn't sure, but I don't feel I'm special. I'm just a hard worker.""
Smythe-Davis is proud, but humble, as she reflects on a gold medal-winning performance at the Riccione European Open - just her second international competition after an absence of nearly three years.
As she begins to reveal exactly what her journey has entailed, and the anxiety-driven ""dark times"" she endured, the extent of her modesty becomes even more apparent.
Smythe-Davis first shot to prominence at Glasgow 2014 by claiming -57kg Commonwealth Games gold, but it was her World Championship podium places - bronze in 2017, and silver a year later - which marked her out as a potential Olympic star come Tokyo 2020.
, though, brought a new level of attention - and pressure. 
""It was hard because people are not just hoping that I'll go and do my best - they're seeing my second Olympic Games as an opportunity to win a medal,"" she recalls.  
""That's what they wanted, that's what I wanted, and that's why British Judo and UK Sport put so much money into me.""
A multiple Grand Slam medallist, Smythe-Davis had confidence in her ability to match those targets, but in late 2019 her world changed after taking a ""bad knock"" in training. 
Concussions vary in severity, and although awareness of their long-term impact is improving, treatment is still largely in its infancy.
Smythe-Davis had access to leading medical professionals including neurologists, but it was near impossible for them to predict how long recovery could, or should, take.
""Anyone who's been through long post-concussion syndrome will know how important treatment is for recovery and I had a whiplash with it as well, so there were a lot of issues with my neck and spine,"" she says.
""The pandemic meant [rehabilitation] ground to a halt and just completely sent me into regression.
""I had a two-to-three-month period where things were really bad with migraines and then there were days where genuinely an accomplishment would be getting up and having a shower or taking the dog for a walk.""
As the Covid pandemic restrictions eased and training opportunities - as well as full medical support - returned, Smythe-Davis made tentative steps towards a return.
She still retained the dream of competing at the 2020 Olympics, which had been postponed by 12 months, but in January 2021 the judoka ""reluctantly"" came to the conclusion she needed to take time away to ensure a full recovery.
""I was in a really dark place and there was a lot of turmoil because I was scared to make the decision and didn't want to let anyone down,"" Smythe-Davis admits. ""But at the end of the day, no-one was going to be as disappointed as myself.""
In August of that year, her life changed forever and ""for the better"" as she became a mother for the first time with the arrival of daughter Ryia.
""I'm very strategic in the way I've always viewed my sporting goals and when would be the right time to become a mother,"" she says.
""I had a plan for after the Tokyo Olympics and making that decision at the time about not to push on after the concussion, that opened the door for me. I'm very fortunate that it happened quite quickly, I had a really health pregnancy and birth of my baby was good.
""It just gave me something else to focus on and she brings a whole new energy to our lives really, and to be honest I don't think I'd want to continue in my sporting journey without her.
""The fact I have her now is almost what spurs me on."" 
Just over a year after giving birth, the Rio Olympian made her competitive international return with a fifth-place finish in an unfamiliar -63kg division at the Oberwart European Open in early September.  
A week later she went on to claim gold - in her traditional -57kg category - in Italy.
29-year-old did not compete at the World Championships earlier this month as she takes ""baby steps"" in her comeback, but will next target the Abu Dhabi Grand Slam on 21 October.  
""Although [taking so long out] wasn't my initial plan, it was the plan that needed to happen to ensure my longevity in the sport and also my happiness,"" says Smythe-Davis.
""I'm trying to now look forward to the Paris Olympics in 2024, but to look back at where I was to where I am now, I'm really proud with my journey and myself."""	/sport/judo/63300639

And Twitter is also stopping users from adding links to their Mastodon account in their bios - calling them ""malware"".

business	Peru to sue Repsol for $4.5bn over oil spill	"Peru's consumer protection agency is suing Spanish oil firm Repsol over a huge oil spill which blackened beaches off the coast of Lima in January. 
, which Peru called the worst ecological disaster around Lima in recent memory, leaked more than 10,000 barrels into the Pacific Ocean.
wsuit seeks $3bn (£2.54bn) for environmental damage and $1.5bn (£1.27bn) for damages to locals. 
Repsol has denied responsibility.
mpany initially said the spill was caused by ""sudden and extraordinary anomalous waves produced by the volcanic eruption in Tonga"". However, it later blamed the oil tanker.  
On Tuesday, a Peruvian judge admitted the $4.5bn lawsuit by Indecopi against Repsol, meaning the case will go to court. 
An underwater oil pipeline owned by the company caused a spill on 15 January. It happened when an Italian-flagged tanker, Mare Doricum, was unloading at Repsol's La Pampilla refinery. 
Repsol has denied responsibility for the spill and said that it sees the claim as ""baseless, inadmissible, and inconsistent"". 
""We have not yet been notified of the court's acceptance of the complaint, and we do not know the details of the acceptance,"" a spokesperson for the firm told the BBC. 
""We reiterate that the causes are still under investigation, but that the preliminary findings indicate that it was caused by an uncontrolled movement by the Mare Doricum vessel while it was unloading crude at the terminal.""
""Even so, Repsol has used all means at its disposal to contain, clean, and remediate the coastline, assist the communities in the area, and rescue and attend to the fauna affected by the oil spill,"" the spokesperson added. 
Earlier this year, President Pedro Castillo described the spill as ""one of the biggest ecocides ever on our coasts and seas"".
Hundreds of fishermen and hospitality workers also lost income due to the disaster, according to the Peruvian environment ministry. 
Local fisherman staged protests because they were unable to go out to sea and work because of the spill. 
Indecopi has alleged that the ecological damage is continuing to affect fishermen and the environment. 
""We are looking to get compensation for the affected population... that lives within 150km of contaminated coast,"" said Julian Palacin, the head of Indecopi, in a statement.
In January, prosecutors also opened a criminal investigation into Repsol's role in the incident. Four executives from the firm were barred from leaving the country for 18 months amid the ongoing probe.  
In May, Repsol said the clean-up would cost the firm $150m (£127m). 
Repsol posted a net income of  €2.499bn (£2.11bn) last year -  sixteen times the clean-up cost.  
Professor in geosciences at the University of Edinburgh, Stuart Haszeldine said that communities and countries ""have a right to expect safe transport of oil and gas"".
""There is no established market to buy a clean beach or a seabird colony - inevitably large and financially well-resourced oil companies can deploy cash, lobbyists and legal teams to delay and defocus the blame game away from their responsibility,"" he said. 
""This will be a contest on the strength of Peru's legal system to enforce environmental justice onto an unwilling and well-resourced multinational."" 
""The final settlement may be influenced as much by Repsol's valuation of its own reputation and future permissions to operate globally,"" he added. 
Melissa Moore, head of UK policy at Oceana, a charity campaigning for ocean protection, said she was pleased to hear the case would go to court.  
""This damaging oil spill wreaked havoc on two protected biodiversity areas: the Ancón Reserved Zone and the Pescadores Islets - home to iconic and legally protected species such as the Humboldt penguin and sea otter,"" she said. 
""Countries globally such as Peru, as well as the UK, need to end our reliance on offshore oil drilling, which has destructive impacts on the ocean, including accelerating climate change."""	/news/business-62659241
business	Meta being sued by ex-Facebook content moderator	"Meta and its contractor Sama are being sued by a former content moderator, who alleges human trafficking and poor mental health support.
Daniel Motaung says he was paid about $2.20 (£1.80) per hour to review posts including beheadings and child abuse.
, brought in Nairobi, claims job adverts failed to warn of the extreme content moderators like Mr Motaung would see.
Sama has called the allegations ""disappointing and inaccurate"".
Meta declined to comment directly on the lawsuit, but in the past has said that it takes its responsibility to the people who review content ""seriously"" and that it requires its partners ""to provide industry-leading pay, benefits and support"". 
Facebook employs thousands of moderators to review content flagged by users or artificial intelligence systems to see if it violates the platform's community standards, and to remove it if necessary.
Mr Motaung said the first graphic video he saw was ""a live video of someone being beheaded"".
Regularly seeing such extreme content ""ends up taking you to a place that you never imagined"", he said. 
Describing the impact it had, he added: ""My life is like a horror movie.""
He told the BBC that he suffers flashbacks where he imagines he is the victim. 
Mr Motaung, who says he has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, believes that his co-workers also struggled with the content they had to view.
""I would see people walking off the production floor to cry, you know, that type of thing,"" he said.
Mr Motaung was recruited from South Africa to work for Sama in Nairobi, where much of the moderation for East and South Africa is handled.
Legal filings claim that job advertisements for the moderation work were misleading and say that Sama used a variety of terms such as ""call centre agents, agent and content moderator"" to describe the roles. 
ffering descriptions, it is alleged, were designed  to ""trick unsuspecting  applicants"" into applying for jobs as Facebook content moderators.
rts did not warn, the filings say, that the work was likely to involve viewing extreme content, and that ""very little detail is given on the actual nature of the job"".
Once employed, the suit alleges, it would have been difficult for workers from disadvantaged backgrounds to leave their roles.
wsuit claims that for Sama to fly workers to Kenya from other parts of Africa amounted to human trafficking.
ry originally broke in Time, and in response to that at the time, Sama said: ""It is completely inaccurate to suggest that Sama employees were hired under false pretences or were provided inaccurate information regarding content moderation work.""
Meta and Sama are also accused in this case of failing to provide the moderators with adequate psychosocial support, of subjecting moderators to unfair labour relations, and of union-busting.
Sama, previously called Samasource Kenya, told the BBC: ""We take this litigation seriously, but the allegations against Sama are both disappointing and inaccurate."" 
firm added that it provided all members of its workforce with a competitive wage, benefits, upward mobility, and a robust mental health and wellness programme.
mpany has also previously said it:
Meta has said it encourages content reviewers to raise issues, and conducts audits of its contractors to ensure standards are maintained.
mpany has also claimed it was not responsible for Mr Motaung's working conditions.
In a letter sent to his lawyers in April, Meta said that he was not an employee of theirs but was at all time employed by Sama, and no action could therefore be brought against the tech giant.
ks financial compensation for former and current moderators at Sama, an order that outsourced moderators get the same healthcare and pay as Meta employees, and orders granting rights to speak out about working conditions and to form a union.
In 2020 Meta paid $52m to settle a case brought by US content moderators over mental health issues developed on the job.
Cori Crider, director of campaign group Foxglove who are working with Mr Motaung's Kenyan lawyers, said she hoped the case would make people think about the daily working conditions faced by content moderators.
""Every single day, when millions of us sit there and scroll through our Facebook, we're not stopping and thinking, we're not realising that sitting behind the screen are thousands of people just like Daniel,"" she said. "	/news/technology-61409556
technology	Second-hand tech booms as shoppers look for bargains	"""We're lucky, to be a family with two full-time working adults. Still, we're turning the thermostat down and putting extra jumpers on. We've switched to budget supermarkets to save money.""
Anna Cargan, 35, lives with her husband and three young children in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. She started saving for Christmas in January. 
""We've really noticed how expensive things have got this year. We're having to think about what we're spending more than ever before.""
Cargans are not alone.
According to research by consultancy firm PWC, 86% of UK adults are concerned about affording the necessities of day-to-day life. 
Meanwhile, 70% of UK adults are planning to spend less this festive period, with almost half planning to cut back on Christmas presents, according to a survey by Accenture.
One tactic Ms Cargan will use to save money this Christmas, is to buy second-hand tech.
""I've saved about £600 buying second-hand phones,"" she says. ""I don't want the latest model - as long as it's functional, I'm happy.""
She bought the phones from Music Magpie, which was founded in a garage in Stockport in 2007. Back then it sold second-hand CDs and DVDs. 
Five years later, it expanded into electronics. Now Music Magpie has two workshops in the UK and one in the US, where it refurbishes all sorts of unwanted electronics.
Sam Vesey, Music Magpie's chief sustainability officer, suggests not only buying second-hand to save money, but also selling old tech too, to fund this year's present buying.
""There are estimates that people have about £600 of unused tech,"" says Ms Vesey. ""That's about £16bn sitting in drawers nationwide.""
Now, with a growing number of companies offering pre-owned tech, buying second-hand, says Ms Vesey, no longer has the stigma it once had.
""We've seen an increase in demand for refurbished tech,"" she says. ""In the same way that we've always been happy to have a second-hand house or a second-hand car, that's now passing through to our technology. People are quite happy to say 'mine's refurbed'.""
According to the UN, e-waste, that's anything with a plug or a battery, is the world's fastest-growing domestic waste stream - fuelled by soaring consumption rates, short life cycles and limited options for repair. 
Its report says that in 2019 only about 17% of e-waste was collected and recycled.
Meanwhile, the International Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Forum estimates that in 2022, more than 5.3 billion mobile phones alone will be discarded.
Gold, silver, copper, platinum and other high-value, recoverable materials, valued at about £47bn, are dumped or burned year after year, rather than being collected for treatment and reuse.
More technology of business:
However, Ms Vesey believes it's a problem with a simple solution.
""The circular economy is at the heart of what we do - reducing e-waste while saving consumers money.""
Music Magpie refurbishes about 400,000 tech items every year.
""If you want to get tech as a Christmas present, think about refurbished. It's a good thing. It's sustainable - and you will save money.""
And from ice cream makers to headphones, there is a huge range of second-hand tech looking for a new home.
In 2014, Matt Gale established UK Gym Equipment with the sole aim of refurbishing commercial exercise machines.
""At the time, most of the large gym chains and council facilities would order brand new equipment, keeping it for just four to five years before upgrading. A huge amount was scrapped.""
UK Gym Equipment refurbishes and sells anything that you can find in a gym - treadmills, cross trainers, bikes, rowers and strength machines. 
Ultimately, says Mr Gale, refurbished means you're getting more for your money.
""One of the biggest selling points is longevity,"" he says. ""Refurbished commercial machines are often still in the market 15 to 20 years after manufacture. There's a consistent level of parts and service support that rarely exists with some of the cheaper high street machines.""
Many electronic devices are not designed with the intention of keeping them in use for a long time.
""The linear economy has been the dominant way since the industrial revolution,"" says Joe Isles, circle of design programme lead at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.
""Take phones, we have them on a contract for 18 months or two years. Then we're encouraged to move on to the next one.""
Unbelievable efforts, he says, are made to source materials, to put those materials together, to design the products and turn them into a device - but often very little thought is put into what happens next.
""Most of the materials we use we lose - after just one relatively short usage period. The economic loss of relinquishing all that, letting it end up in landfill, is eye-watering.""
And, it seems, the big tech companies are starting to realise this.
Vodafone has recently launched a refurbished phone range, offering a two-year warranty on  every pay-monthly  refurbished phone. 
Research carried out for Vodafone by OnePoll found, of the 2,000 people surveyed, 73% would consider buying a refurbished phone to save money. 
However, the research also highlighted peoples' concerns about buying second-hand tech, including worries about limited battery life, device longevity and data security - as well as a reluctance to use ""someone else's"" device.  
give customers peace of mind, Vodafone only offers handsets in ""great"" or ""pristine"" condition. 
Every phone has a 32-point visual and diagnostic check to ensure components, such as the screen, battery and camera, are fully functional. Each device is deep cleaned and securely data wiped. 
So, this year, while money is tight for so many families, perhaps buying and selling old tech is a way to help fund Christmas.
Back in Barrow-in-Furness, Anna Cargan says: ""It's more important than ever in a cost-of-living and climate crisis to reuse things as much as we can.
""I'd love to see a world where we all see second-hand as first choice."""	/news/business-63779342

See Monster in Weston-super-Mare features four levels which host a wild garden of plants, grasses and trees.
It also includes an amphitheatre, a kinetic installation that forms the monster's ""scales"" and a waterfall.
Local residents were given first access to the site from 11:10 BST and it is due to open to the wider public from 09:00 on Saturday.

Unboxed, a national collection of 10 large-scale public art engagement projects, has received recent criticism about the £120m cost to the taxpayer, but chief creative officer Martin Green said it was ""absolutely value for money"".
See Monster has also been delayed by more than two months, and was originally expected to open from July.
It was delivered to the North Somerset town's beach on 13 July and was lifted on to a base at the Tropicana venue where it has dominated the skyline ever since.  
Executive member for placemaking and growth at North Somerset Council Mark Canniford said: ""See Monster continues to offer a huge boost for our local economy, and the final stage of people climbing the rig will bring additional visitors to North Somerset during the autumns months, out of the usual tourist season.""
Patrick O'Mahony, creative director and founder of Newsubstance, said: ""We are thrilled the public can now board See Monster, after witnessing its transformation over the past few months.
""We hope this once-in-a-lifetime experience, that started as an experiment in education and creativity in Weston-super-Mare, will go on to have a much greater and long-lasting legacy.""
Dr Ella Gilbert, climate science adviser to the project, said: ""See Monster reminds us how our industrial history has shaped our climate, and how we can transform our future by repurposing infrastructure like oil and gas platforms.
""See Monster is an opportunity to see and hear about the kind of solutions and possible futures we can create together and to be awed and amazed by the spectacular sights and sounds of the weather, to be excited by the science behind it and to learn how it helps us understand our planet.""

Factory International, which is due to open in 2023, is understood to be in ""advanced"" talks with a number of firms on a branding deal. 
move comes after the project was estimated to be about £100m over budget. 
Inflation, workforce shortages and supply-chain disruption have all been blamed for the rising costs.

He said: ""We've already had really advanced conversations with that have been in excess of the £24m mark.

business	Cost of living: Renters search for tenancies with bills included	"Demand among tenants has jumped for properties where all the bills are included in the rent, according to Rightmove.
roperty website said inquiries for build-to-rent homes with bills included had risen by 36% over the past year.
Millions of people are facing rising domestic gas and electricity bills as the cost of living soars.
rospect of further rises will have increased demand for all-in rent.
Existing pressure on tenants' finances comes as the average monthly rent being advertised across Britain (excluding London) was a record £1,088 in the first three months of the year. That was an 11% annual increase, Rightmove said.
In London, average asking rents have increased by 14% annually to £2,195 per calendar month.
re are also more than triple the number of tenants inquiring as there are rental properties available, making the market highly competitive, according to the website.
Homes with balconies, communal gardens, properties allowing pets and those offering zero deposits were all popular, it said.
Nearly two-thirds (63%) of landlords told Rightmove they have kept rents the same for their tenants over the past year, with the remaining 37% saying they have increased their rents.
m Bannister, Rightmove's director of property data, said: ""A shortage of rental homes and strong demand for the properties available has led to a greater number of tenants choosing to renew their leases and stay put, rather than re-enter a competitive rental market.
""People who had been waiting to see what happened last year are now being faced with record rents and so are seeking out properties where they can have more certainty over their outgoings, with all bills included becoming increasingly sought after.
""Landlords may have been tempted to put their rents up given the high demand from new tenants, but many understand the affordability challenges of rising rents and bills, as our study shows that the majority are charging their tenants the same as a year ago.""

health	Empty Southend care beds are criminal says health boss	"A care home manager said it was ""criminal"" that more hospital patients were not being discharged into empty beds within the community.
Michael Daley, who is also chair of the South Essex Care and Health Association, said he did not understand why some homes were not being used.
's records showed there were 45 empty beds across 17 care homes in the area.
Southend Hospital said it worked ""closely with partners"".
""If you are in hospital for weeks on end, I think it's pretty criminal to be honest,"" said Mr Daley, resident manager at Cavell Lodge in Leigh-on-Sea, speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.
""I don't understand why they are not being placed in some of these [care homes].
""We're in a crisis situation. Surely it would be better to move somebody elderly into a warm home, which is more homely than keeping them in an acute area blocking the bed for somebody that needs it.""
Southend-on-Sea City Council is reluctant to place patients in care homes rated inadequate or requires improvement by the Care Quality Commission (CQC).
's register showed that Melrose House in Southend, rated requires improvement, had 15 unoccupied beds. Abbeyfield care home in Westcliff is rated good but has nine empty beds. 
Latest figures from the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust showed that Southend, Basildon and Broomfield hospitals had an average of 93 patients at the end of each day, during October, who ""no longer met the criteria to reside"".
Southend Hospital CQC inspection, however, concluded that the discharge of surgery and medical care patients was ""in line with good practice"".
Kay Mitchell, the council's Labour cabinet member for adult social care and health integration, said homes rated requires improvement, or below, were found ""to not be delivering good quality care"".
She added that the council kept in contact with homes to find beds for the ""small number"" who needed them.
A spokeswoman for the Mid and South Essex Integrated Care System, on behalf of the Trust, said it ""continues to work closely with partners across the wider health and care system to ensure our patients are discharged safely and when they are clinically ready"".

entertainment	Londonderry protest over proposed BBC Radio Foyle cuts	"Politicians, senior clergy and community leaders have called on the BBC to reverse its proposed cuts at Radio Foyle.
Protestors gathered outside the station in Londonderry on Wednesday afternoon.
Eight news staff are at risk of redundancy and output, including the Breakfast Show as well as local news bulletins, is being cut.
It is part of a wider plan announced on Tuesday to close 36 posts across BBC Northern Ireland to make savings.
rim director of BBC NI said the corporation faced ""some difficult choices, none of which are easy"".
""We have to find monies to maintain and develop our local presence on BBC iPlayer and to absorb cost pressures across different aspects of our work,"" Adam Smyth said.
""Our concern in all of this will be to safeguard audience value and benefit and to remain mindful of the impact that this announcement will have on BBC staff in Northern Ireland.""
Davey McCauley, who organised Wednesday's rally, said he has been listening to Radio Foyle for about 40 years and said it was so important to everyone in the city and beyond.
""This station is the heartbeat of this community,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle's News At One.
""Radio Foyle highlights and challenges issues that wouldn't be done anywhere else.
""If they take it away we don't think other broadcasters will cover them; if we lose it then we will lose an integral part of ourselves.""
Mr McCauley said the move by the BBC was ""a death by a thousand cuts"" and believes this was the first step in the potential closure of the station.
Marie Lindsay, former principal of St Mary's school in Derry, attended the protest because she felt she had to be there.
""I thought my protesting days were over, but you're never too old to protest for what is right,"" she told BBC Radio Foyle.
""It is right that BBC Radio Foyle is here and remains here in its full capacity.
""The turnout and the spectrum of people who have gathered here is quite unique.
""BBC Northern Ireland needs to understand the swell of feeling and swell of support for the staff and the work they do.""
However Alice Enders, who is an expert in the creative industries, told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that the BBC was in a ""squeeze in terms of its revenue"".
""The BBC has to keep pace with the development of the internet,"" she said.
""There is no doubt these cuts were made with a heavy heart because local radio is a popular with audiences,"" she said.
However she added that there has been a ""major migration to online services"" with audiences.
She said the BBC was facing alot of competition from streaming services.
""This is old media versus new media,"" she added.
""Everyone would like to have online services and at the same time maintain and keep all the local radio services - I'm very attached to local radio.
""But at the same time we are talking about a frozen licence fee and inflation,"" she said.
""None of these cuts are made with the stroke of a pen,"" she added.
Media commentator Stephen Price said the BBC was in the position where ""its licence fee has been frozen therefore it is having to find cuts somewhere.""
""News is the most expensive thing that the BBC does and it's probably not surprising that news is being cut,"" he added.
Under the proposals for BBC Radio Foyle, a daily 30-minute news programme will remain on BBC Radio Foyle along with the Mark Patterson Show and the Sean Coyle Show.
BBC Northern Ireland is planning to close 36 posts in an attempt to make £2.3m of savings and invest more money in online services.
According to the most recent BBC annual report, BBC NI has a workforce of about 600, with the majority of those employees based in Belfast at Broadcasting House and Blackstaff.

72-year-old helped her country win the Para women's pairs bowls.
Lenton was making her debut at the Games.
""I think I am dreaming, to be be perfectly honest,"" Lenton told BBC Sport after linking up with Pauline Wilson to defeat Australia's Cheryl Lindfield and Serena Bonnell 17-5 in the gold-medal match at Leamington Spa's Victoria Park on Wednesday.
""It hasn't quite sunk in yet but this is absolutely fantastic. I never thought I would ever get to a Commonwealth Games and if I did, it would be as a spectator.""
Lenton and Wilson, 58, have a combined age of 130 but the pair proved age is no barrier, and there were joyous scenes on a day Lenton never thought she would experience.
Lenton is part of Team Scotland's Para-bowls team after reinventing her life when routine surgery led to an infection and a series of other operations.
She had been due to go and watch the Games in Manchester in 2002 as a spectator before health problems thwarted her.
Formerly a competitive sailor and cyclist who had gone on charity rides to China and Russia, she took up bowls in 2005 and has competed in three world championships, winning a silver medal in one. 
She went on to take up wheelchair curling and has competed in nine world championships.
""I hadn't played the sport [bowls] until I ended up in a wheelchair in 2002,"" Lenton said in an interview before the Games.
""I went into hospital for what was meant to be a straightforward operation but I got an infection and had to have nine operations and was in hospital for three months.
""I struggled going back to work for three years before I had to give it up in 2005. I took up bowls, really as a social thing, to get myself out of the house and mix with people. 
""When I was at bowls, someone suggested wheelchair curling too. You can't sit at home and wait for the world to come to you, you have to make the effort and go out and meet others.""
Lenton was forced to appeal for sponsors to help with the cost of equipment for the Games.
""We have to use specifically coloured balls for television purposes,"" she said before the event. ""We still need to get one more set which can cost between £250 and £380.""
Wilson said Wednesday's gold medal triumph with Lenton had left her lost for words.
""It is absolutely phenomenal,"" she added. ""It's been a great experience and one that I will never forget. We were confident, we believed in ourselves and we did it.""
Lenton said: ""When it mattered we did the business. We always knew we could do it."""	/sport/commonwealth-games/62410956

business	Four areas added to banking hubs waiting list	"Four more communities have been earmarked for shared banking hubs - becoming the latest on a list of 27 areas waiting for services to begin.
At these hubs, customers of any bank will be able to access their accounts, deposit cash and cheques, and withdraw money at any time.
Only two have opened so far, while hundreds of bank branches have closed.
Fears have been raised that local businesses and vulnerable residents would struggle without cash services.
four new locations which will receive hubs are: Bury Park in Bedfordshire, Haslemere in Surrey, Prestatyn in Denbighshire, and Welling in south east London. 
Residents and local politicians requested the hubs come to their areas owing to previous closures of bank premises.
resa O'Neill, leader of Bexley Council, said she was thrilled a hub was coming to Welling.
""Since losing our last banks almost a year ago, the community has not had convenient access to cash, meaning that residents have had to travel for basic banking needs. 
""This is also damaging to businesses who rely on banks to cash their takings too. We look forward to the change it will make within the town.""
BBC visited a prototype shared banking hub in Rochford, Essex, and was told it had been ""a lifeline"" for many people living in the area after the last branch in town closed.
Running costs are the same as a small branch, but are shared between different banking groups that use it.
However, there is concern that regular bank branches are closing at a rapid rate. Consumer group Which? said that 587 branches have closed this year, with another 75 scheduled to shut by the end of 2022, on top of hundreds in previous years.
re is little chance of these new hubs replacing many of these closed banks at the moment.
Difficulties in opening the new hubs have included finding suitable premises, and making it fully accessible and secure enough for banking services.
Natalie Ceeney, who chairs the Cash Action Group and Banking Hub Company, said: ""We are expecting a couple more to be live before Christmas. We are making good progress with all hubs and expect a significant number to open in early 2023. 
""When we are visiting locations that will get a hub, we are looking for buildings that are the right size, located in an appropriate location and have the facilities to support all customers. We then often need to make changes to the building to make them suitable for a banking hub, some of which need us to get planning permission. This process has not always been easy, but we are making good progress. 
""What is important is this time last year, if a community lost their last branch, there was no solution. Over the next couple of years, we expect to be supporting hundreds of communities across the UK.""
Jenny Ross, money editor at Which?, said: ""Banking hubs could play an important role in ensuring the cash needs of local communities are met. However, the rollout is taking far too long and the hubs must open as soon as possible so consumers can benefit.""
In addition to the hubs, more withdrawal and deposit machines - which are unstaffed but can allow businesses to cash in their takings - will be placed in premises such as libraries and community centres and available during their opening hours.
will be located in Bingley in West Yorkshire, Finchley in north London, Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, Melksham in Wiltshire, Plympton in Devon, and Sandbach in Cheshire."	/news/business-63471272
health	Man Up: Yeovil player opens up about mental health for film	"A footballer has released a documentary about mental health in football to encourage others to open up about the difficulties they might be facing. 
Man Up, a film by Yeovil Town midfielder Charlie Wakefield, was inspired by the loss of his uncle Lee who took his own life in March 2020.
""There's a pressure in football. I think boys don't want to show weakness,"" said Mr Wakefield. 
""The first thing people can do is talk, I want this to be the start,"" he added.
Mr Wakefield's uncle Lee was 50-years-old when he died, and in the documentary the footballer also interviewed team-mates about the death of former Yeovil Town captain Lee Collins, who took his life in March 2021. at the age of 32.
""More needs to be done, and it's hard to see when people are going through a tough time. 
""I spoke to a counsellor after Lee, and I've said to the lads here that it helped me massively,"" said former defender Luke Wilkinson in the film.
Mr Wakefield said he realised his documentary could ""be a voice"" for footballers.
""Football can be mentally draining, I've experienced so many highs and so many lows.
""There's a lot of emotion involved and a lot of setbacks which people don't see that in the outside world.""
He has since been contacted by people who admitted they were struggling. 
""That was the aim for me, I'm pleased that people have reached out to me. 
""Just chatting to your mate and getting things off your chest is important,"" he said.

business	Elon Musk no longer world's richest man	"Elon Musk is no longer the world's richest man after a sharp drop in the value of his shares in electric car company Tesla this year.
According to both Forbes and Bloomberg, Mr Musk has been overtaken at the top spot by Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of luxury goods group LVMH.
Mr Musk is chief executive and the largest shareholder in Tesla, with a reported stake of about 14%.
He completed a $44bn takeover of social network Twitter in October.
According to Forbes, Mr Musk is now worth about $178bn (£152bn).
Meanwhile, Bernard Arnault has a value of $188bn.
Mr Musk's Twitter deal was only completed after months of legal wrangling, and some have cited the distraction of the takeover as one of the factors behind Tesla's share price fall.
After building a stake in Twitter at the start of the year, Mr Musk made his $44bn offer in April, although many considered this offer to be too high.
In July, he pulled out of the deal, citing concerns over the number of fake accounts on the platform.
Eventually Twitter executives took legal action to hold Mr Musk to his offer.
Dan Ives from investment firm Wedbush Securities said the ""circus"" surrounding the Twitter deal has weighed on Tesla's share price.
""Musk has gone from a superhero to Tesla's stock, to a villain in the eyes of the Street, as the overhang grows with each tweet,"" he told the BBC.
""The Twitter circus show has hurt the Musk brand and it's a major overhang on Tesla's stock. Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk.""
Mr Musk sold billions of dollars worth of Tesla shares to help fund his purchase, which helped to push the shares down. 
Investors have also been concerned that demand for the company's electric cars may slow, as the economy weakens, higher borrowing costs discourage buyers and other companies boost their electric vehicle offerings.

business	Buy now, pay later: Warning over use of credit cards to cover payments	"Young shoppers risk building up debts by borrowing money to make buy now pay later repayments, Citizens Advice says.
Half of 18 to 34-year-olds used different types of credit - such as credit cards or borrowing from family - to make the payments, it said.
Although the results were drawn from a survey, the charity said the answers highlighted the issue of people relying on one debt to cover another.
Changes are being made that make some of these debts clearer to lenders.
Buy now pay later has become a commonplace method of payment and credit for UK shoppers in recent years. It allows people to pay for purchases in instalments over a short-term fixed-payment schedule, and interest-free.
Some 17 million people in the UK, including 30% of those aged in their 20s, have used it. While popular, it has led to concerns over levels and visibility of debt - particularly as budgets are squeezed by the rising cost of living.
Citizens Advice surveyed 2,288 people who had used buy now pay later during the past 12 months.
It found that most (52%) made repayments from their current account, but 23% used a credit card, 9% used a bank overdraft, and 7% borrowed from friends and family.
Millie Harris, a debt adviser at Citizens Advice in East Devon, said: ""Most of the people I speak to who are using buy now pay later live off overdrafts and credit cards, so are using these for repayments. It is just relying on one debt to pay off another debt. 
""What scares me most is how easily people can slip into using it. They come to rely on it much more quickly than other forms of credit. It's just a few clicks at a checkout. Too often that means people don't realise how serious it is - that it is credit and there are consequences if they don't repay it.""
One in 10 people in the survey said they did not fully understand how repayments would be set up.
Chloe Porter, from Birmingham, used to use buy now pay later and admitted she was uneducated about credit.
""When I moved out [from her parents' home], I was struggling to keep the repayments up and I ended up having to use credit cards to make the repayments. I just dug myself a hole,"" she said.
Since the start of June, banks and credit companies have been able to see whether shoppers use services from Klarna - the biggest buy now pay later company in the UK.
firm said this could help or hinder its customers' ability to get credit for loans such as mortgages, but did offer more clarity to potential lenders.
Buy now pay later firms have been under pressure from watchdogs over contract terms and conditions and they information they give to credit agencies. Stricter regulation is expected soon.
ggest operators in the UK are Klarna, Laybuy and Clearpay.
A spokeswoman for Clearpay said: ""Globally, 90% of Clearpay transactions are made with a debit card and 95% of instalments are paid on time, demonstrating that our customers use their own money to pay for purchases and that they understand how our repayments are set up.""
She said the company was supportive of good regulation.
Earlier in the week, technology giant Apple said it was planning to launch a buy now pay later option for users of Apple Pay, initially in the US."	/news/business-61719592

He said the UK was in a ""time of political change and some uncertainty"" as it prepared to appoint a new prime minister - its third within two months.
On Monday, it was confirmed Rishi Sunak would succeed Liz Truss in Number 10.
""A stable and prosperous Britain is in all our interests,"" Mr Martin said.
He was addressing UK and Irish politicians at a meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly.
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the new prime minister will face a challenge of ensuring Northern Ireland ""does not remain endlessly in limbo"" without government.
Speaking in Belfast, she accused the DUP of ""inertia and inaction, and do-nothing politics"".
Ms McDonald said Downing Street should quickly demonstrate a willingness to get Stormont restored. 
""There certainly can't be any further delay,"" Ms McDonald said.
""We need to see an end to the brinkmanship, to the bad faith and we need to see now a good faith engagement and the making of a deal, which by the way and we have said this repeatedly, can be done very, very quickly.""
In Mr Martin's speech on Monday morning, he called for better cooperation between the UK and Irish governments on the issue of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
rotocol - the post-Brexit trade arrangement for Northern Ireland - has been a source of tension since it came into force at the start of 2021.
ks between the UK and the EU have resumed in an attempt to resolve the issue but there is no sign of an imminent deal.
""To the incoming British prime minister I want to stress the importance of the two governments working in partnership to support the gains of the Good Friday Agreement,"" said the taoiseach.
""I urge the new British prime minister to move quickly to genuine and substantive engagement with European Union.""
British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly - made up of politicians from both jurisdictions - meets twice a year, with this event focussing on trade and the economic effect of Brexit.
g the event also heard from Northern Ireland Office Minister Steve Baker.
He said that regardless of who became the UK's new prime minister, the government would stick to its existing policy on the Northern Ireland Protocol.

politics	Pat Finucane: UK government in legal breach over investigation	"UK government remains in breach of its legal obligation to carry out an investigation into the murder of Pat Finucane, the High Court has ruled.
39-year-old Belfast solicitor was shot by loyalist gunmen in front of his wife and children in his home in 1989.
His family has campaigned for a public inquiry into his murder after several examinations of the case found state forces colluded in the attack.
His widow legally challenged the government over the lack of an inquiry.
In his ruling on Wednesday, the judge Mr Justice Scoffield quashed the government's decision not to establish a public inquiry.
He also said that former Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis had unlawfully failed to reconsider calling an inquiry after a police review process had ended.
judge said the government must make a new decision to address investigative deficiencies over the murder.
He said that Mr Finucane's widow Geraldine found herself ""in a sorry situation"" nearly four years after the UK Supreme Court declared that previous investigation into the killing failed to meet the standards required by Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
judge said: ""I have no hesitation in concluding that the United Kingdom government... remains in breach of Article 2 on the basis of the ongoing delay in completing an investigation which satisfies the requirements of that provision.""
Mr Finucane was described in court as the victim of a scheme in which loyalist paramilitaries were infiltrated, resourced and manipulated to target those identified for assassination.
A barrister for his widow argued that only a public inquiry would uncover the full extent of a state-operated policy of ""extrajudicial executions"".
In February 2019 the Supreme Court identified a continued breach of the requirement to hold an Article 2-compliant investigation.
Since then Mrs Finucane has mounted further legal battles against the government's response to that ruling.
In November 2020 Mr Lewis announced there would not be a public inquiry at that stage because he wanted other police reviews of the case to run their course.
He was ordered to pay £7,500 damages to Mrs Finucane for the excessive delay in reaching his position.
ge centred on the legality of his decision to await the outcome of reviews by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.
Mrs Finucane's legal team argued that the PSNI had now finished its work, while the ombudsman's process would not be completed until at least 2025.
It was argued that the decision taken by Mr Lewis was irrational, unlawful and a breach of human rights.
Although then Prime Minister David Cameron apologised in 2012 for the ""shocking"" levels of collusion in the case, the court heard that no members of the security forces had been held accountable for the killing.
A barrister representing the Northern Ireland secretary said there was no suggestion that the Supreme Court's findings against the government had not been accepted.
But he argued that Mr Lewis had been legally entitled to await the outcome of other police reviews.
judge rejected that those reviews would be ""capable of discharging"" the government's obligations in terms of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
He decided against compelling the government to establish a public inquiry, saying that it should be given an opportunity to consider its next step.
judge ordered current Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris to reconsider the government's response to the Supreme Court's findings.
He said he understood Mrs Finucane's concerns that the government had simply postponed ""a difficult choice in favour of buying further time"".
He added: ""If the secretary of state wishes to make a new case that an Article 2-compliant investigation is no longer feasible or would now be futile, he should do so.
""If… he does not make any such case but is nonetheless not prepared to establish a public inquiry or some other mechanism in order to remedy the Article 2 deficiencies identified by the Supreme Court... he should state that clearly and give his reasons."""	/news/uk-northern-ireland-64053473
business	Faisal Islam: Veiled concern about Trussonomics at IMF	"British economic policy faced some thinly-veiled criticism by other G7 finance ministers at the crucial meeting of major economies at the IMF yesterday, the BBC understands.
While the UK was not identified by name, multiple participants at the round table, the debut of UK Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng, raised their concerns about countries making unfunded tax cuts that threatened financial stability, at a delicate time, a clear reference to Britain.
One G7 minister said privately that the concern was really about how the UK had ""doubled down"" even after the clear financial stability implication, and that explanations would be sought.
US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had already said publicly on the sidelines of the IMF conference that she was ""watching UK developments closely"".
While she didn't want to comment on UK policy, she said: ""I am going to try to understand what the impact of those policies and their rationale is.""
Secretary Yellen, a former Federal Reserve Chair told CNBC when asked if UK fiscal credibility problems were making global markets more volatile said ""at a time when monetary policy is tightening, fiscal policy should have a stance that complements that that central banks play the lead, but fiscal policy should be complementary. We've tried to do that in the United States.""
President of the Eurogroup, which represents the Eurozone, the Irish Finance minister Paschal Donohoe, told the BBC: ""The United Kingdom is a G7 economy with their own currency. 
""And it's absolutely obvious in all of the public statements that have been made by the Bank of England and by the government of the United Kingdom, that they're aware of developments that are taking place and have every confidence in their ability to be able to manage these kinds of developments.""
But he stressed that Ireland had taken a ""different approach"" by deciding ""not to borrow"" to fund energy crisis help, because he wanted to make sure it was affordable and ""the need to ensure financial market confidence"".
former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, when asked about the message being sent by markets to the UK, said, ""whether it's in monetary policy or fiscal policy, or climate policy, credibility comes from commitment, clear commitment, it comes from transparency, and it's buttressed by institutions"". 
Mr Carney said he had ""full confidence in the Bank of England"" to get inflation back down and to safeguard the financial system and ""as a consequence of both of those, markets will settle and they will price risk accordingly. And I'm sure the government is aware of that and working to ensure that it has the right budget policy""."	/news/business-63238028

25-year-old beat Canada's Hollie Naughton 11-7 11-5 12-14 11-5 to become the first Englishwoman to win a Commonwealth squash singles title.
Kennedy, a Harvard graduate, rose from a world ranking of 185th to the top 10 in less than a year and reached her highest ranking of eighth in July.
""I wish I could put into words what this means to me,"" she said.
""But I honestly can't. It's a dream and this dream has become reality and I've been thinking about how it would feel for so long.

Kennedy, who trains at the same club as tennis star Emma Raducanu, previously said winning Commonwealth gold would be the ""absolute pinnacle achievement"".
She will be joined on the podium by England team-mate Sarah-Jane Perry, who won bronze in an astonishing 3-2 comeback against New Zealand's Joelle King.

health	Scottish Ambulance Service staff set date for industrial action	"Scottish ambulance staff are set to take industrial action on 25 November over a pay dispute.
Around 1,500 Unite members – including paramedics, advanced practitioners, planners and administrative workers – will take part.
union says it is also considering co-ordinated strike action with other NHS staff unless the Scottish government submits a new pay offer.
Ministers have warned there is no more money to fund public sector pay rises.
Unite said all of its Scottish Ambulance Service workers would take ""continuous action short of strike"" from 00.01 on 25 November.  
will include an overtime ban and work to rule. This means staff will adhere strictly to contractual terms on working hours and scheduled breaks.
Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said he was disappointed by the move and he was ""committed to ongoing discussions to avoid strikes"". 
Unite's general secretary Sharon Graham said: ""Unite is determined to encourage the Scottish government to return to the negotiating table. 
""The action short of strike we have announced is designed to prevent all out strike action but make no mistake about this, if there is no new improved offer then this is exactly what will happen and the Scottish government will be to blame.""
It comes after the union's NHS members including paramedics, theatre assistants and laboratory workers voted against a flat pay offer from the government earlier this month. 
Scottish ministers had proposed a pay rise of £2,205 for all staff - an average 7% pay uplift, or more than 11% for the lowest paid. 
Unite said it was considering co-ordinated strike action with the other NHS trade unions if its industrial action does not prompt an improved offer.
Members of the Royal College of Nursing, the GMB union and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy have backed strike action. 
But Unison, Scotland's largest health union, has suspended its strike ballot of NHS staff and is consulting its members on a revised pay offer until 14 November.
Jamie McNamee, Unite Scottish Ambulance Service convenor, said: ""The offer currently on the table is insufficient and unacceptable. In real terms it represents a significant pay cut. 
""The present situation is directly contributing to the NHS losing senior staff due to being overworked and poorly paid. 
""Our NHS workers deserve better from the Scottish government and now they have a final opportunity to make a fair pay offer before this pay dispute dramatically escalates.""
Finance Secretary John Swinney has said that although cash had been moved around in the health budget to give NHS staff a better offer, further pay uplifts would mean cuts elsewhere.
Mr Swinney announced £615m of spending cuts in his emergency budget review. It came on top of £560m worth cuts to public services in September.
His colleague, Mr Yousaf, the health secretary, said: I'm disappointed Unite members in the Scottish Ambulance Service are taking industrial action.

health	French vote for right to abortion in constitution	"France's National Assembly has backed a bid to enshrine the right to abortion in the constitution, prompted largely by increased restrictions elsewhere.
Lawmakers voted by a large majority to include a clause guaranteeing ""the effectiveness and equal access to the right to end pregnancy voluntarily"".
Left-wing MP Mathilde Panot, who is behind the change, said it was to protect against the ""backsliding"" seen in the US and Poland.
But the bill will face a tough passage.
Last month the upper house, the Senate, rejected a similar proposal and is thought unlikely to back the new amendment. Right-wing parties - which dominate the Senate - argue that abortion rights are not under threat in France.
A change of constitution would also have to go to a referendum, although opinion polls suggest more than 80% of French voters are behind it.
Ms Panot's amendment went through after securing the support of MPs in Emmanuel Macron's ruling Renaissance party, but a reference to the right to contraception was scrapped.
Macron MP Aurore Bergé had been due to present her own abortion amendment next week but withdrew it, telling MPs how her mother had endured an abortion without anaesthetic before it was legalised in 1974.
""The question of access to abortion and of protecting it isn't a whim; it shouldn't be politicised; it's not a matter of party politics,"" she said.
Justice Minister Eric Dupond-Moretti also backed changing the constitution and praised the ""historic"" vote.
Last February, the French parliament voted to extend the legal timeframe for abortion from 12 to 14 weeks, similar to neighbouring Spain. It is lower than other European countries, including Sweden, the Netherlands, England, Wales and Scotland. 
Ms Panot dedicated Thursday's vote to women in the US, Poland and Hungary. Her push to change constitution was triggered by a vote in the US Supreme Court to end the national guarantee to abortion access, overturning the landmark Roe v Wade ruling in 1973.
rteen US states have since begun enforcing abortion bans, while voters in states including California backed proposals this month to enshrine the right to abortion in their constitution.
Poland has a near-total abortion ban and this year began enforcing a ruling that terminating pregnancies with foetal defects was unconstitutional.
Meanwhile, Hungary's nationalist government recently tightened restrictions on abortion to require pregnant women to prove a foetus's sign of life before requesting a termination."	/news/world-europe-63754796

health	Nottingham nurses take to picket line 'with heavy heart'	"Nurses in Nottingham have joined industrial action across Britain - in their biggest strike in NHS history. 
Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is calling for a 19% pay increase  - which the government says is unaffordable. 
Nurses at the Queen's Medical Centre and City Hospital voted for action but colleagues at King's Mill in Nottinghamshire will work as normal. 
monstrating said offering higher wages was a key part of retaining staff and offering safe care.
government has said it is ""hugely grateful"" to nurses but the pay rise being demanded is unaffordable.
Nurses in a picket line outside Lings Bar Community Hospital in Gamston are part of action across England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
RCN official Neil Thompson, who has 46 years experience as a district nurse, said the decision was taken with a ""heavy heart"". 
""When it came to actually completing the ballot paper I was in tears,"" he said.
""This is probably the most emotional thing we have ever done and it is awful, it is really dreadful we are having to do this - but we feel we have no choice.
""We want to achieve safe staffing for our patients and unless we get paid fairly we won't be able to persuade people to stay in nursing.""
Healthcare assistant Daisy James said she earned just over £10 an hour and felt she could make more in a supermarket.
""That's quite bad if you think about it, with the amount of responsibilities we have day in, day out,"" she said.
""I'm not taking anything away from supermarket workers who do a fantastic job but we are responsible for patient safety and our pay doesn't reflect that at all.
""With the cost of living, staff are leaving because they can't afford to do the job they are doing.""
As a specialist renal nurse, Rachel Humphreys said she earned more but the problem was wider than individual salaries
""There is not enough staff to care for the patients - nationwide there are over 40,000 nurse vacancies.
""We are passionate about our jobs and it has been really difficult to make the decision to come out but we feel as if we have no choice.""
Katie Manning, a lung cancer nurse, said it took a lot to convince her to come out on strike.
""Our patients are suffering everyday and I think to myself how many patients die or are not being cared for adequately on wards across the country,"" she said.
""We know it because we work there and see it, making decisions about which patients get painkillers or which get drips or do you care for the old lady that has been incontinent in the bed, or care for the dying patient and their family?
""You are reprioritising all day long and usually with three or four nurses off - it is draining and demoralising.""
NHS Nottinghamshire said planned surgery and outpatient appointments would be affected by the nurses' strike action.
Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Integrated Care Board, Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust and Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust will see services affected due to the ""reduction in staff"".
Patients were told to ""attend your appointment as planned"" unless contacted by the NHS.

entertainment	Lost Desert Island Discs: Collector finds more than 90 missing recordings	"LISTEN: The voices of Dame Margot Fonteyn, Bing Crosby and Sir Dirk Bogarde on Desert Island Discs
More than 90 lost recordings of BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs have been discovered by an audio collector from Lowestoft in Suffolk.
Bing Crosby, Dame Margot Fonteyn, James Stewart, David Hockney and Dirk Bogarde are among the big names who appear in the episodes found by Richard Harrison.
He described finding the missing recordings which date back to the 1960s and 1970s as ""a great feeling"".
Former Discs presenter Sue Lawley said: ""Thank God for Mr Lowestoft.""
rediscovered tapes speak from a bygone era; clipped, formal, with the odd American accent thrown in.
Amongst the US stars are not just Crosby and Stewart but one of the most popular entertainers of the first half of the 20th Century, the actress and singer Sophie Tucker.  Unlike these men, but like many others on the list, Tucker is no longer a household name.  
Many of the luxuries chosen by the interviewees being cast away are also of a different time.  
Fonteyn asks for the kind of ""mask that skin divers use"". 
Bogarde wants John Singer Sargent's ""haunting"" portrait of the Sitwell family, pointing out that he could turn it into a tent or a raft if he needed to.  
Bob Monkhouse asks for a ""large colour picture of Marilyn Monroe to remind me of what I'm supposed to forget"".
As for reading matter, Hockney requests an out of print pornographic book, Route 69 by Floyd Carter, ""otherwise you might fantasise too much on the island"".  
Crosby wants Roget's Thesaurus because with that, and a sharp stick, ""I could do some useful writing"".
rogrammes are an insight into the lives of some of the (predominately white male) greats of the last century, many of whom are no longer with us. They are also a window onto a British cultural institution.
I met Richard Harrison at his home in Lowestoft where he told me he's always been ""interested in finding missing radio"".  He's a member of the Radio Circle, a group of enthusiasts who try to locate lost programmes. He says he honed in on Desert Island Discs because it's ""such an iconic programme"".
For years the BBC didn't automatically archive its radio programmes, so when episodes are missing, collectors like Harrison are dependent on listeners from the period who recorded the shows on reels and cassettes so they could listen again.
Harrison's attic is stacked full of boxes of recordings he's bought at car boot sales and, more often, auctions.  Some are labelled, others aren't. In his spare time, he loads them on to his old player to discover what's on them.
""It's a great feeling. You open up a box and you have no idea what might be on the tape.""
With the Desert Island Discs, he's struck radio gold.
Harrison was ""most excited"" to find, on an unlabelled reel, an episode from 1964 with the award-winning actor Bogarde.  
""The neighbours must have wondered what was up. I let out a huge yell of triumph, it was a genuinely great moment"".
In the show, Bogarde tells the presenter Roy Plomley he was determined to be an actor ""as soon as I was born"".  His first job in the theatre was ""cleaning out the gentleman's lavatory in the Kew Theatre"".  
Bogarde went on to star in films including The Servant, Oh! What a Lovely War and Death in Venice.  He reveals in the episode that he had ""lost my nerve for the theatre"", his first love, and had ""decided to pack that in"".  
respectful. Plomley, who devised and hosted Desert Island Discs from 1942 until his death in 1985, didn't interrogate his guests in the style of interviewing we have come to expect now; there's rarely a follow-up question.
According to Lawley, early on in the show's history Plomley would take his interviewees out to London's Garrick Club for lunch. ""They would have the whole conversation, then he would go home and type it all up. Then they would meet at Broadcasting House across a green baize table and read the script to each other.""
Whether scripted or not, Plomley's recordings are sometimes as interesting for the questions he doesn't ask.
Dame Margot's appearance in 1965 was the 750th edition of the long-running show. The Royal Ballet's prima ballerina extraordinaire told Plomley she was looking forward to living on a desert island as she would be ""delighted"" to get away from the telephone.
With World War Two still casting a long shadow, she describes being on tour in the Netherlands in 1940 when she saw the German army ""landing by parachute"".  The ballet company ""left hurriedly in what we were wearing and what we could wear on top of our ordinary clothes"", abandoning scenery, costumes, music, ""everything else"". 
Plomley does mention the Russian dancer Rudolf Nureyev, but only to ask about whether they had to change their styles to work together. Nureyev had defected to the West just a few years earlier and Dame Margot had famously forged a dancing partnership of such chemistry that rumours grew as to the nature of their relationship. Yet Plomley is discretion personified.
Dame Margot is one of just 18 women who appear in the rescued episodes. Others include the 1967 Forsyte Saga star, Nyree Dawn Porter, sometimes described as the first romantic sex symbol of the television age. Her introduction in an episode from 1970 bluntly signals what a different era these recordings were made in.
""This week our castaway is an actress,"" says Plomley, ""and a very attractive one, too"".
rescued episodes are indisputably of their time. They also illustrate why Desert Island Discs, as Lawley puts it, is ""much more than a simple little radio show"". Its secret is that music is a ""direct line to your feeling"" and through the music you get ""this great tide of emotion that runs underneath it"".
rogramme was originally recorded in the BBC's bomb-damaged Maida Vale studio in 1942, airing on the Forces Programme two days later.
It came off-air in 1946, returning to the Home Service in 1951 before transferring to Radio 4 in 1967, with the guests' mainly classical choices in these episodes reflecting that history.  
re are exceptions. Dudley Moore says ""when I can't sleep, I'll play a record"".  His second choice is Spinning Wheel by Blood Sweat and Tears, because ""I think pop is giving jazz a tremendous boost in spirit"". 
Crosby manages to squeeze his friends into his track choices, kicking off with a record from his brother's band, the Bob Crosby Bobcats.  
rview with Crosby took place in 1975, less than two years before he died.  But that smooth, unmistakeable voice still sounds like he's in his High Society heyday. He makes a plea to be cast away on an island in the South Pacific, ""where you can swim, maybe fashion a hook and fish"". 
Crosby's luxury is a guitar. ""Out there alone, I'd get to be very good at it, but nobody would hear me.""
I like to imagine Crosby, and all the other long departed guests of these programmes, happily enjoying their rejuvenated immortality on a distant desert island.  They have been given new life in these rescued episodes, and as the crystal surf laps over their sun-drenched feet, we should all rejoice at being able to rediscover them.

business	Supermarket petrol stations to close for Queen's funeral	"Petrol stations at the UK's major supermarkets will be closed for most of the day of the Queen's funeral, before some reopen in the evening.
, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons will close forecourts on Monday before some reopen at 17:00 BST.
It is understood only a small number of Tesco self service fuel stations will reopen in the evening and customers have been advised to check local pumps.
Supermarkets operate about one-in-five of forecourts, but dominate fuel sales.
Independent traders operate about two-in-three of the country's filling stations, but only sell just over a third of all fuel, and the remainder is accounted for by sites owned by oil companies, according to the RAC motoring group.
""With many supermarket forecourts closed until the evening on Monday, our advice to drivers needing to refuel is to seek out a good value independent filling station that's choosing to stay open, or top up over the weekend instead,"" RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said.
Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent fuel retailers, has been contacted for comment.
Morrisons said that while all of its supermarkets will be closed on Monday as a ""mark of respect and so colleagues can pay tribute to Her Majesty"", its petrol stations would reopen at 17:00.
However, the majority of its fuel stations have different opening times so drivers have been urged to check if local ones are open on the company's website. 
Sainsbury's said its filling stations will be open from 17:00 to 22:00 on Monday to allow customers to ""pick up essential items"".
""We thank our customers for their understanding,"" the supermarket said in a statement.
Major shops and businesses across the UK have announced they will shut their doors as a mark of respect for Queen Elizabeth II on the day of her funeral.
King Charles III approved a bank holiday on Monday for the state funeral at Westminster Abbey, but it is up to employers to decide whether to give staff the day off to observe the national day of mourning.
Shell said it would close its company-owned petrol stations between 10:30 and 13:00.
giant has a total of 1,123 sites in the UK and owns and operates 526 of them. The remaining 597 are owned by independent dealers, which trade under the brand.
mpany said its intention was the shut during the funeral service to ""allow staff and customers to pay their respects"". 
It said the opening hours of its independent stations were at the ""discretion of individual business"", but added that the company had ""invited them to also consider closing to enable their staff and customers to pay their respects"".    "	/news/business-62916831
technology	UK looks to Sweden for a solution to nuclear waste	"In deep, astonishingly clear, blue-lit ponds some 40m (130ft) beneath the Swedish countryside, lies decades worth of high-level nuclear waste.
It is an oddly beautiful and rather disturbing sight. Row upon row of long metal containers, filled with used nuclear fuel from the country's reactors, lie below the surface near Oskarshamn, on Sweden's Baltic coast.
It is both highly lethal and entirely safe. 
Lethal, because this material is intensely radioactive; safe, because it sits beneath 8m of water, a very effective barrier against radiation.
Waste can be kept like this for decades. In fact, it needs to be. 
Intense radioactivity generates a great deal of heat, and this kind of material has to be cooled for long periods before it can be removed for storage. 
question of what to do with it afterwards, though, is one that many governments, including that of the UK, have been grappling with for years.
roblem is not quantity. 
Even after some 60 years of commercial and military programmes the UK's stockpile of the most dangerous high-level waste amounts to a few thousand tonnes, although there are also several hundred thousand tonnes of intermediate-level waste which will have to be dealt with as well.
real issue is time. 
""Used fuel assemblies are intensely radioactive, and that radioactivity takes a long time to decay,"" explains Prof Neil Hyatt, chief scientific adviser to the UK's Nuclear Waste Services.
""After about 1,000 years, about 10% of the original radioactivity is left, and that will slowly decay away over about 100,000 years or so.""
reates unique difficulties.
""We can't rely on institutional control for timescales of much longer than a few centuries,"" says Prof Hyatt.
""The Roman Empire lasted about 500 years. The last ice age ended about 10,000 years ago. 
""So the surface of the Earth and human civilisations change much more quickly than the rate at which the radioactivity in this spent nuclear fuel can decay.""
Sweden has already reached its own conclusions. It plans to bury its waste in rock deep underground and leave it there for good.
rocess known as geological disposal, and the country's scientists have spent decades studying different ways in which it could be carried out.
Much of the research has been carried out in the Aspo Hard Rock Laboratory, a facility built near Oskarshamn in the south of the country.
Hundreds of metres beneath the surface, a network of huge man-made caverns has been drilled into the rock. 
It is being used for experiments, looking at how wastes could be packaged and entombed, and at how the materials being used might degrade over time.
rock here is fissured and running with salt water - ancient brine that has migrated from the Baltic Sea far above over thousands of years.
Such a damp environment would not be suitable for a real disposal facility. But according to Ylva Stenqvist, a project director at the country's nuclear operator SKB, it is perfect for testing.
""This site was picked because it is quite wet,"" she explains.
""Because if we try our experiments in an area which is really dry, we have to wait for ages for any kind of results. 
""So we consciously chose this place to accelerate some of the experiments, to really stress our materials and our methods and see how they stand up in this quite aggressive environment.""
Earlier this year the Swedish government approved plans for a real geological disposal facility (GDF), to be built at Forsmark, some 150km north of Stockholm.
roject is expected to cost about 19bn Swedish kroner (£1.5bn; $1.8bn), and create 1,500 jobs, though construction will take decades. Work on a similar scheme, across the Baltic Sea in Finland, began in 2015.
ments are being watched carefully from the UK, which also intends to build a GDF, though repeated attempts to find a suitable location have been stymied by political intransigence, as well as by intense opposition from local protesters and environmentalists.
Current efforts to find a site and a population willing to host it now follow a ""consent based"" approach, under which the government body Nuclear Waste Services sets up partnerships with local communities in order to engage them in the process.
As an incentive, those communities are offered £1m in investment for local initiatives when they sign up, with that figure rising to £2.5m if deep drilling operations take place.
Since this process began in 2018, four such partnerships have been set up. 
ree are in Cumbria. They include the section of coastline that is already home to the Sellafield nuclear plant and many of its workers. The fourth, and most recent, was established in Theddlethorpe, Lincolnshire.
Scotland is not part of this process, and the Scottish government currently does not support deep geological disposal.
Even in the areas where partnerships have been set up, strong opposition remains.
""We are vehemently opposed to the geological disposal of hot, heat-generating nuclear waste,"" says Marianne Birkby of Cumbria protest group Radiation Free Lakeland.
""The waste should remain where it can be monitored, where it can be repacked, and where it can be retrieved if something goes horribly wrong,"" she insists. ""Below ground there would be absolutely no chance of containment if a leak occurred.""
More technology of business:
It is unlikely that a site for a UK GDF will be settled upon for at least another 15 years. But some experts question whether it should ever be built at all.
Among them is Dr Paul Dorfman, associate fellow of the science policy research unit at the University of Sussex and chair of the Nuclear Consulting Group, an anti-nuclear energy organisation.
""Geological disposal is a concept, not a reality,"" he explains. ""There is significant scientific uncertainty about whether the materials which would be used can survive the depredations of time.""
He believes the government's enthusiasm for new nuclear power stations is the reason why it is pushing to build a GDF.
""If you can't get rid of the waste, you can't produce more, which means that nuclear's USP - that it's climate-friendly and so on - is completely dependent on the notion that you can get rid of this waste,"" he says.
""Geological disposal is in fact, unfortunately, a nuclear fig leaf.""

technology	Astronomer in Twitter limbo over 'intimate' meteor	"An astronomer from Oxfordshire was locked out of her Twitter account for three months after sharing a video of a meteor which was flagged by the site's automated moderation tools.
Mary McIntyre was told that her six-second animated clip featured ""intimate content"", shared without the consent of the participant.
Her only option was to delete the tweet.
However, in doing so she would have had to agree that she had broken the rules.
Her initial 12-hour ban went on for three months - and she exhausted the online appeals process.
""It's just crazy... I  don't really want it on my record that I've been sharing pornographic material when I haven't,"" she said of her refusal to delete the tweet.
Her account was still visible, but Ms McIntyre couldn't access it. 
Following the BBC publishing this article, it has now been restored.
Since Twitter was purchased by Elon Musk, thousands of staff have either been laid off or have left their jobs, but even before that Ms McIntyre found it impossible to talk to anyone about it inside the firm.
""If I wasn't getting a human response before [Musk took over], I think I've got zero probability of getting one now,"" she said at the time.
Yoel Roth, Twitter's then head of trust and integrity, had tweeted that the firm's layoffs did not affect ""most"" of the 2,000 content moderators working ""on front-line review"". Mr Roth has himself since left.
BBC tweeted Twitter's support account and contacted Mr Musk via SpaceX because Twitter currently has no communications department. There has been no response.
Ms McIntyre said other astronomers had shared the video on her behalf without consequences. 
She was worried that if she agreed to Twitter's rules of re-instatement, her non-existent misdemeanour might be flagged up, as she has regular checks in order to work with school-aged children, explaining astronomy.
""I miss the interaction,"" she said of her locked account. ""I feel a bit cut off from the astronomy world.""
US meteorologist Ryan Vaughan faced a similar ban after sharing a video of combine harvesters working in a field at night. This too was flagged as an intimate moment.
Mr Vaughan eventually did choose to delete the tweet and falsely accept that he had broken Twitter's community rules, because he wanted his account back.
""It's not fair and it's wrong,"" he tweeted. ""This needs to be fixed.""
re are also reports of Twitter accounts being wrongly flagged as belonging to children aged below 13 and blocked - including one belonging to a charity for the families of people held hostage, and another of a BBC journalist.
mmentator Kate Bevan said it was an example of the limitations of the current artificial intelligence tools used by Twitter and other social networks to carry out moderation tasks.
""AI tools are OK for quick and dirty decisions, but it shows that content moderation at scale is really difficult - both for humans and for the AI tools that are supporting them,"" she said. 
""It's even worse when there are no humans available to review bad AI decisions. Apart from the unfairness, it means the AI model isn't getting feedback, so it will never learn to improve.""
It is not a problem that is unique to Twitter: in 2021 the owner of a small digital photo gallery had pictures of wildlife, landscapes and buildings blocked by Facebook, on the grounds that they contained ""overtly sexual"" content.

health	How Covid has dealt the NHS a lasting blow	"NHS in England has more funding and staff than before the pandemic - but in many types of care, it is treating fewer patients. Why? A leading think tank has tried to come up with some answers.
Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says this is a puzzle with no simple explanation - but the pandemic has dealt a lasting blow to the NHS and it could be costing more to treat patients, on average, than before.
Despite higher staff sickness rates, compared with pre-pandemic levels, the NHS has available to work:
But - not counting those filled by patients who have tested positive for Covid, even though they may be there mainly for something else -  there were 5% fewer beds available in the third quarter of this year than in 2019, the IFS says. The impact of the virus has lasted longer than expected. 
It is also harder to discharge medically fit patients because of problems with community care.  
And evidence, such as rising numbers of disability-benefit claimants, suggests there are more ill patients needing complex care.
monthly data shows 4% more GP appointments in England than in the same month in 2019, which is ""particularly striking"" as the number of fully qualified general practitioners has fallen, the IFS says.
re were also more first cancer hospital outpatient appointments - but fewer overall and the number of patients treated from the waiting list, currently 7.2 million in England, was down 11%.
f NHS finances has been well documented and the report says the real value of the current spending plans has been reduced by inflation.
IFS research economist Max Warner says: ""The NHS is showing clear signs of strain heading into the winter and is treating fewer patients than it was pre-pandemic, across many types of care. 
""The real risk, almost three years on from the start of the pandemic, is that the Covid hit to NHS performance is not time-limited. 
""Going forward, we need to grapple with the possibility that the health service is just able to treat fewer patients with the same level of resources.""
A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""As the IFS report acknowledges, Covid had a significant impact on the NHS, and we are focused on delivering the biggest catch-up programme in health history"".
NHS had reduced waits of 18 months by 60% in a year and ""virtually eliminated"" waits of more than two years.
""We're allocating an extra £500 million to speed up hospital discharge, getting ambulances back on the road more quickly, and increasing the number of NHS call handlers.""
f a series of IFS reports. 
first found the NHS was doing less than before the pandemic, despite more staff and funding.
But this one is designed to highlight the complexities and mitigating factors, concluding there are significant long-term changes to the health and care landscape worthy of further investigation."	/news/health-63962629
technology	Cost of living: Government to simplify broadband access	"government is launching a new system to simplify access to cheaper broadband.
From 22 August, people receiving certain benefits can ask broadband firms to check their eligibility for social tariffs.
means customers will not have to take full responsibility for proving they qualify for low-cost options.
Campaign group Digital Poverty Alliance described it as a positive first step but warned it did not go far enough.
Elizabeth Anderson, chief operating officer for the Alliance, argues that, as more sectors moved essential resources and services online ,""it's not right that a growing number of people face being cut off from the online world"".
Which? analysis of recent Ofcom data revealed nearly six million households are struggling to pay for essential telecoms.
Steve Leighton, chair of the Internet Service Providers Association, said the association welcomed the government's launch of an application programme interface (API) for members - following calls by the sector for a system to help verify eligibility. 
""While we still need to see the technical details, the API should help our members identify eligible customers more easily and offer them targeted support,"" Mr Leighton said.
But he reiterated concerns over whether the measures went far enough, adding the government could ease the cost of living crisis' impact on the industry by reducing VAT on broadband bills.
Reduced social tariffs allow UK households receiving government benefits such as Universal Credit, Pension Credit, Jobseeker's Allowance and Income Support to pay less for internet and telecoms access.
Current providers include BT, Community Fibre, NOW, Sky, Virgin Media and VOXI. 
riffs range from £10 to £25 per month depending on preferred bandwidth, supplier and who qualifies for the low-cost alternative.
Nadine Dorries, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said social tariffs were ""vital for families struggling with bills"". 
Ms Dorries said the government had secured commitments from the UK's internet service providers to help customers struggling with bill payments and costly contracts to stay connected. 
""I urge anyone concerned about falling behind on payments to contact their supplier to see what support is available,"" she added.
government's new system, which allows customers to more easily prove eligibility for cheaper broadband, aims to raise awareness and take up of broadband social tariffs among the general public.
Ofcom reported earlier this year that only 1.2% of more than four million households receiving Universal Credit had successfully applied for broadband social tariffs.
Ms Anderson said the low-cost options needed more promotion by the government and the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), which will run the new eligibility system.
She said the DWP should ""actively make everyone who's eligible aware of social tariffs"" to prevent those struggling from being plunged into digital poverty - essentially unable to afford to go online.
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Thérèse Coffey said the new system, which launches next week, would make social tariffs easier to access at a time when it was ""more important than ever that people get the financial support available to them"". "	/news/technology-62548810

While these profiles can't offer an exhaustive insight into what every US voter could be seeing - and they don't have friends or followers - they do give us a snapshot of what voters across the political spectrum are being exposed to. 
Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), which tracks extremism and disinformation worldwide, says that election conspiracy claims and abusive language aimed at politicians online have intensified in the run-up to the midterms.
As I've checked into each of my undercover voters' accounts over the past two months, it's Britney's that have been most frequently exposed to violent and misleading content.  
When setting up her account, I liked pages and accounts that supported Mr Trump, opposed mandatory vaccination and questioned the motives of billionaires. These topics appear to have been a gateway to more extreme content, when compared with the other undercover voters. 
Larry was exposed to posts featuring misleading claims about the 2020 election and abusive language directed at politicians, while Emma was also recommended several pages using abusive language aimed at supporters of Donald Trump and Supreme Court Justices, but nothing on the scale of what Britney was recommended. 
When I logged onto Instagram in particular, I found she was recommended more and more accounts that made false claims about fraudulent voting and denied that President Biden won the election. 
regularly featured hashtags like #Trumpwon in their profile descriptions and on their posts, and shared memes about the riots on the Capitol claiming that ""January 6th wasn't an insurrection"".
Britney's profile was also shown TikTok videos from accounts promoting conspiracy theories that the election was rigged, also repeating the phrase ""Trump Won"". 
Last week, Instagram showed her conspiracy theories contradicting the police account of what happened when Paul Pelosi, the husband of US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was violently attacked in their home. Posts also made light of the violence. 
Finally, pages recommended to Britney's Instagram account also featured posts talking about female politicians in abusive and misogynistic terms. 
most frequent targets were Nancy Pelosi, Kamala Harris, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton. There were comments about them performing sex acts, and slurs about their appearances, alongside criticism of their politics. While posts often spoke about Joe Biden and Donald Trump in hateful terms, they were not subject to the same sexualised language.
guage was unique to Britney's accounts. On Facebook, Emma was recommended pages that promoted naming and shaming racists and Trump supporters, but the rhetoric had not escalated in the same way. 
Gabriela was increasingly recommended right-leaning content on social media, often about inflation and the cost of living crisis, but it stopped short of the more extreme disinformation and hate that Britney encountered. 
Larry and Michael were targeted more frequently by official campaign adverts and content from the political parties themselves, especially on sites like YouTube. For Larry, the messaging was focused on crime, inflation and immigration. For Michael, the adverts and posts talked about abortion, climate change and education.
As well as noting the uptick in hate ahead of the midterms, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue says disinformation online has focused on conspiracies about the Biden administration, as well as the issue of voting in specific US states. 
""That, when combined with social media product features and failed policies, is giving permission to more hate and vitriol,"" said Jiore Craig, the ISD's Head of Elections and Digital Integrity.
In particular, the ISD found election conspiracy theories in short-form video formats across several platforms. Social media companies have ""inconsistent and insufficient moderation policies"" to deal with this kind of content, its research concludes. 
research also expresses concerns that the major social media companies are not taking election denials seriously, although they have made various commitments to tackling disinformation and hate ahead of the midterms.
In August, Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - said it would devote ""hundreds of people across more than 40 teams"" to ensure the security and safety of the midterms, and apply ""learnings"" from the past election. 
Meta told the BBC that it has robust measures in place to combat misinformation, including partnerships with 10 fact-checking organisations in the US.
It also said it has ""clear policies about what is and isn't allowed on our platforms"" and ""continually reviews content"" to see if it violates policies. 
kTok also announced its own ""commitment to election integrity"" ahead of the vote, saying it had partnered with fact-checking organisations. It told the BBC it took its ""responsibility to protect the integrity of our platform and elections with utmost seriousness"".
Populist Right Britney, Progressive Left Emma and even Apolitical Gabriela have been recommended increasingly polarised content on Twitter over the past two months, particularly on immigration, crime and climate change. 
Britney's account was also shown a conspiracy theory shared by Elon Musk about the attack on Mr Pelosi - Mr Musk later deleted his tweet. 
re are concerns that lay-offs and potential changes to moderation policies on Twitter, which Mr Musk now owns, could also lead to an increase in online disinformation just before voters head to the polls.
Several of the Instagram accounts that Britney has been recommended promoting claims that Trump really won the 2020 election have also praised Mr Musk for buying Twitter and referenced their plans to return to the site. 
witter says that while it has lost employees, their ""core moderation capabilities remain in place""."	/news/world-us-canada-63530374
technology	Israel defence minister's cleaner jailed for trying to spy for Iran-linked hackers	"An Israeli court has jailed a former housekeeper for Defence Minister Benny Gantz who attempted to pass information to an Iran-linked hacking group.
Omri Goren, 38, was sentenced to three years in prison under a plea deal that saw prosecutors drop espionage charges. 
Israeli justice ministry said Goren told Black Shadow hackers he could send information on Mr Gantz and put malware on his computer in exchange for money. 
But he denied knowingly attempting to spy for Iran, Israel's arch-enemy.
""[He] is not a spy and this isn't a spying scandal,"" his lawyers were quoted by the Times of Israel as saying after Tuesday's sentencing hearing. 
""This is about a man who found himself entangled in debt and identified a security breach,"" they added.
Goren reportedly told investigators that he had planned to trick the hackers into giving him money without handing over any information.
ment released last November alleged that Goren reached out to Black Shadow on Telegram after reading Israeli media reports about its hacking attempts. 
rove that he worked for Mr Gantz he sent photographs of items in the minister's home, including his desk, computer, a safe and tax records, it said.
justice ministry said Goren's attempt was thwarted by the Shin Bet security service and that no classified material was revealed.
However, the Shin Bet did face questions about how Goren was allowed to work for the defence minister when he had previously been sentenced to prison on four occasions, including for armed robbery.
gency later acknowledged ""procedural failures"" in the way that he was vetted and said protocols had been tightened in response."	/news/world-middle-east-62805534
health	A&E: Royal Victoria Hospital scenes shocking and distressing, says RCN leader	"Rita Devlin says there was ""mayhem"" in the emergency department at the Royal Victoria Hospital
Royal Victoria Hospital's under-pressure emergency department (ED) are shocking, distressing and heartbreaking, the director of the Royal College of Nursing in Northern Ireland has said.
Rita Devlin visited nurses on the front line on Tuesday, 48 hours before a planned strike.
She said she felt like ""weeping for staff"" when she saw the scenes.
Belfast Trust said ED services were under extraordinary pressure.
On Wednesday night, the Southern Trust said its emergency departments at Craigavon Area Hospital and Daisy Hill Hospital were ""extremely busy"", with significant pressures across its hospitals.
Ms Devlin said she saw ""people lying head-to-toe everywhere"" in the emergency department at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital.
""They could reach out and touch each each other - that raises questions about dignity and infection control.
""Very ill patients are practically lying side-by-side which breaks so many rules around safety.""
Ms Devlin has been a nurse for 40 years and worked in the Royal Victoria Hospital emergency department during the Troubles.
But on Tuesday afternoon, she said she had heart palpitations as she watched what was going on in that same department. 
Last week, a senior consultant likened scenes in the emergency department to ""battlefield"" medicine.
Nurses in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are due to strike on Thursday in a dispute over pay, which came after health sector workers from three of Northern Ireland's biggest unions held a 24-hour strike on Monday. 
Ms Devlin said she visited the hospital's emergency department to speak to nurses before Thursday's strike.
mergency area is exempt from strike action as nurses felt they could not leave the area understaffed.
Ms Devlin said she and others were frustrated as no-one appeared ""to be in charge or supporting nurses in the very worst conditions"". 
""I watched BBC NI's pictures from inside the ED last Thursday - I was horrified. Nurses told me that it's gotten worse since then,"" she said.
Some patients are being moved onto wards from the emergency department, where there is no actual bed space.  
re being put beside nurse's stations where there is no oxygen or electricity sockets. 
Staff told Ms Devlin some patients had been waiting in the ED for more than three days and families were distraught.  
""I want to know what those in charge are doing,"" she said.
""A group was formed called the SPPG - made up of the former health board and led by civil servants. 
""They've been working on ED plans. Where are they? 
""Also, what are the Belfast Trust directors and non-executive directors doing?
""This is a crisis and we are hearing from no-one at the very top of the trust or the civil service.""  
Ms Devlin said nurses had written to Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris two weeks ago over pay.
Although the letter had been acknowledged, there was no sign of a meeting, she said.
""After what I saw in the ED, I intend to write to the permanent health secretary Peter May - nurses need support, lives are being lost,"" she added.
Mark Dayan, from the Nuffield Trust, an independent health think tank, said political stalemate is causing further issues.
""The vacuum in leadership in Northern Ireland at a time when the health service is in such a terrible state, that must be really worrying for a lot of people who might need health care,"" Mr Dayan said.
""It also means that there can't really be a mechanism of accountability where somebody can credibly promise the public that things will get better.""
re has been no power-sharing government since February after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) withdrew from the executive in protest over the Northern Ireland Protocol.
Since 28 October, senior civil servants, otherwise known as permanent sectaries, have been in charge of Stormont's nine government departments - their powers are limited and they can only implement policies previously agreed by politicians. 
Peter May is the permanent secretary in charge of the Department of Health.
In its statement, the Belfast Trust said the pressure has been building for many months.
""Our staff work every day under the most challenging conditions while doing their very best for their patients,"" the trust said.
""All of us in health and social care know this situation is far from ideal. 
""We welcome the support from RCN colleagues and other trade unions as we work in partnership to promote safety."" "	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63966706
entertainment	Night & Day: Couple threatened over noise complaint, court told	"A couple who made a noise complaint against a neighbouring music venue received ""very threatening"" messages after filing it, a court has heard.
Rex Chesney told Manchester magistrates he and his partner moved out of their flat on Dale Street in the city after being threatened on social media about the complaint against Night & Day Cafe.
ue's owners are appealing a council noise abatement notice. 
A council official told the court they had ""witnessed a nuisance"" at the bar. 
Night & Day Cafe has been part of Manchester's music scene since the early 1990s and has hosted a wide array of well-known bands as they rose to fame, including Elbow, Arctic Monkeys, Wet Leg and Kasabian. 
Local Democracy Reporting Service said it was served with the council notice in November 2021, following a complaint from a neighbouring flat.
Speaking on the second day of the hearing, Mr Chesney told the court he and his partner moved out of the apartment in May because they felt ""very uncomfortable"" in Manchester and had received social media comments, which were ""very threatening"".
He said the media coverage of the case had ""consumed"" his partner, who had became a ""recluse"" and had lost weight because he was not eating.
He said the couple had been living in the same city centre area when they bought the flat, but he had not expected the music from the venue to ""make water ripple in a cup by the bed"" in the early hours.
He said the noise had made the bedrooms ""uninhabitable"" and though the couple had spent £21,000 on sound insulation, they still could not sleep due to the music during club nights.
He also said the previous owners of the apartment had a problem with the noise, as did other residents, but they were not willing to come forward publicly.
urt was told council officers visited the flat in November, during a club night at the venue, and said they could hear the high pitch vocals of a track being played.
Days later, the local authority issued a noise abatement notice which the venue appealed, arguing that turning the music down would kill the business.
Licensing officer Ben Moran said there had been no further noise complaints since the notice was served and He said the council did not want to close the venue and would not prosecute the owners immediately if the noise abatement notice was upheld.
However, he said the authority would not withdraw the notice because the venue had not taken any steps to address the noise nuisance.
""The notice is enforced because we've witnessed a nuisance,"" he said.
""There's potential for that to reoccur if the residents move back into the property which they should be able to live in.""
ring will continue on 17 January.

business	Life tough for millions of households, says Sainsbury's boss	"Shoppers are ""watching every penny and every pound"", the boss of Sainsbury's has warned, as the supermarket revealed its profits had been hit by the rising cost of living.
Simon Roberts said the grocer got ""how tough it is for millions of households"" and was trying to keep prices low. 
Food prices are rising at their fastest rate in 42 years as the cost-of-living crisis squeezes household budgets.
People are also struggling with higher energy bills and rising interest rates. 
Sainsbury's said sales across the business had climbed 4.4% to £16.4bn in the six months ending in September. 
But the UK's second-largest supermarket also revealed a dip in profits as the business absorbed some of the impact of rising food costs and put up wages.
mpany, which also owns Argos, said underlying pre-tax profit declined by 8% to £340m compared with the same period last year.
Mr Roberts said: ""We will have invested more than £500m by March 2023 in keeping prices lower by cutting our costs... meaning we have more firepower to battle inflation.""
grocer's profits also reflect a return to normal shopping habits since the pandemic lockdowns ended.
rice of pasta, tea, chips and cooking oil has soared, according to official data, with vegetable oil going up by 65% in a year.
Overall, the price of budget food in supermarkets rose by 17% in the year to September, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Experts say the rise in the cost of groceries has been accelerated by the war in Ukraine, which has disrupted grain, oil and fertiliser supplies from the region.
Food and drink prices have also been affected by the recent weakness in the pound, which has made imported products and ingredients more expensive.
Earlier this month, a BBC survey uncovered growing concern about the squeeze on finances. Some 85% of those asked are now worried about the rising cost of living, up from 69% in a similar poll in January.
Like other supermarkets, Sainsbury's has given its staff two pay rises this year to ""reflect the current challenges households are facing"".
Sainsbury's and Argos hourly retail staff saw their pay rise from £10.00 to £10.25 an hour, and from £11.05 to £11.30 an hour in London.
grocer has said profits for the current year are set to decline as it chooses to invest more into its pricing and pay improvements for workers.
Zoe Gillespie, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said Sainsbury's, like its peers, was ""stuck between a rock and a hard place"" as it faced increasing labour costs and the impact of high inflation. 
""Sales have remained robust, but the effects of the macro-economic situation are beginning to filter through into profitability,"" she said. 
Despite this Sainsbury's said it was ""well placed"" for the Christmas trading period, and to deal with further cost-of-living pressures into next year.
group is halfway through a £1.3bn cost-saving programme, which has seen it shut down in-store restaurants and standalone Argos shops.
It said it expected to close about 50 Argos stores this year as part of the previously announced plans, with around 25 Argos sites set to open within larger Sainsbury's shops."	/news/business-63496408
technology	Why smart thermostats don't always save you money	"A few years ago, Dominic McCann realised that his smart thermostat was a treasure trove of data. So he decided to hack it, in order to track what his boiler was doing literally every minute of the day.
Using open source software, he accessed data from the thermostat online and plotted graphs that charted boiler activity against the changing temperature of a particular room. And when he upgraded the bi-folding door in his dining room to a triple-glazed model, the system instantly captured the difference that made.
""I could quickly get a handle on, 'Oh, if I do this, I've saved this amount of energy,'"" he recalls. Insights like this helped him to save money, over time.
Mr McCann, who lives in Manchester, was aided by his technical background. He is director of Azymuth Acoustics UK, a noise assessment firm. When he first tinkered with his thermostat, back in 2019, he was arguably in a small minority. 
But with rocketing energy prices, and the associated cost-of-living crisis, more people are turning to their smart thermostats seeking answers to the question: how do I reduce my energy bill?
Generally speaking, a smart thermostat is a connected version of a traditional central heating controller - one you can program and adjust via a smartphone or tablet app, or smart speaker. 
Manufacturers have long touted these gadgets as money savers. Over the years, they have certainly provided increasingly detailed information about users' energy consumption and offered partially automated heating control. 
And yet there is still debate over how beneficial smart thermostats are, with some research indicating that installing one doesn't always result in reduced energy use.
Google Nest, Honeywell, Drayton Wiser, Tado, Hive - all these brands say their systems make it easier to manage your heating. And many offer to learn how you heat your home, or detect when you're out, and respond automatically in an effort to curtail usage and save you money.
Mr McCann was arguably ahead of his time. In response to the cost-of-living crisis, smart thermostat maker Tado recently launched a software update that provides monthly bill predictions to help users keep within a budget. There are also room-by-room comparisons so people can see which rooms in their home require the most heating.
A spokesman for Tado says that the ""vast majority"" of its users are able to save money with its system.
re are more than 75 million smart thermostats installed worldwide and this number is expected to more than double by 2025, according to Neil Barbour, an industry analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence. 
He cites research from The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, which estimated that smart thermostats enable a roughly 10% reduction in home heating and cooling per household. 
With that in mind, Mr Barbour and his colleagues have calculated that the US could reduce its total energy consumption by 45.4 terawatt hours - roughly the same amount of energy used by the entire state of Mississippi in 2020 - if every home with a heating, ventilation and cooling system installed a smart thermostat by 2026.
would be quite a saving. But the research on how people actually use these devices paints a mixed picture. One study of Honeywell smart thermostat data from 1,379 households in California, published in September, found that users generally undid the benefits of the gadgets by manually overriding their scheduled programme of heating or cooling. 
In other words, it was easy to boost the heating, for example, which meant some people eroded their energy savings.
However, a separate analysis published in 2020 of data from 20,000 Ecobee smart thermostats in the US found that users sometimes overrode their device's schedule in a way that used less energy. So manual interventions, overall, were not as costly as expected. The study was part-funded by Ecobee.
Smart thermostats may struggle when users expect them to do all the work for them, suggests the lead author of the second study, Brent Huchuk, who now works for tech firm PassiveLogic.
According to him, someone who is good at tweaking their own system is likely to do better than a smart thermostat.
""It's pretty hard to beat someone who's actively managing [their] heating and cooling schedule,"" he says.
He also notes that the automatic interventions of smart thermostats will be limited when people work from home, since that reduces the number of opportunities the smart device has to shut the heating off. 
re are also technical quirks to be aware of. In the UK, for instance, some highly energy efficient boilers on the market can modulate (adjust up or down) how much energy they use, in response to the amount of heating required.
But to take full advantage of this, you have to choose a smart thermostat that is fully compatible with your specific model of boiler. The Heating Hub, an independent consumer advice organisation, has published details about this online.
""It's such a minefield for households,"" says founder Jo Alsop.
In the future, smart thermostats could theoretically track energy prices in real-time and allow people to heat their homes when it is cheapest to do so, suggests Dr Huchuk. 
A 2017 study by Enrico Costanza at University College, London, and colleagues, experimented with exactly this idea. Participants received specially designed thermostats that displayed sample pricing data moment-by-moment.
might be a little too much information for many. But the study suggested that, across multiple households, this could prompt a reduction in overall energy consumption. 
Prof Costanza argues that, in reality, it would be more useful to give people information about their energy use over a longer period, say a month, or a forecast that explains how much someone could save by heating the house a little less in the morning, for example. 
""Making it easier for people to understand how they spend energy can make a difference,"" says Prof Costanza.
