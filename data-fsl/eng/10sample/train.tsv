health	Charities warn Rishi Sunak about cost of living crisis suicide risk	"Rishi Sunak has been warned about the impact the cost of living crisis is having on mental health and suicide rates. 
In an open letter to the prime minister, 19 charities including the Samaritans and Mind, have urged the prime minister ""to act with speed and compassion to tackle the root causes of destitution"".
People living in the most deprived 10% of areas in the UK are more than twice as likely to die from suicide than those living in the wealthiest 10% of areas, according to the Office for National Statistics.
government has pledged £5.4m funding to over 100 suicide prevention charities to support them to deliver their services.
In addition, £15m has been invested through the Prevention and Promotion for Better Mental Health Fund in 40 local authority areas in the most deprived parts of the country.
In their letter, the charities say they will continue to provide all the support they can but add: ""The first intervention to reduce mental ill health and prevent suicide is to ensure every household has the means to be safe and warm with enough to eat.""
Last year 5,583 suicides were registered in England and Wales which was 6.9% higher than in 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics.
Mental health charities have reported an increase in concerns about money, with the Samaritans saying they were contacted 12,000 times in July alone.  
Mind's Infoline has seen a 40% rise in calls related to money compared with last year.
Some 77% of adults in Great Britain reported feeling very or somewhat worried about the rising costs of living, according to the Sunak warned about hardship suicide rate riskOffice for National Statistics.
Samaritans say that with over 1.5 million people currently on a waiting list for help, the cost of living crisis could put the mental health system ""on the brink of collapse.""
government has had a suicide prevention strategy in place for England since 2012 and in 2019 it launched a cross-government ""workplan"" to coordinate action by the NHS, charities and local government.
Watch: Sajid Javid on losing his brother to suicide
Labour's Shadow Minister for Mental Health, Rosena Allin-Khan has called on the government to ""recommit"" to the strategy.
She added: ""The next Labour government will enshrine a truly preventative approach to mental health, opening mental health hubs in every community.""
In October, Conservative MP Jason McCartney raised the issue on the House of Commons, saying that each death is ""a tragedy for their family, for their friends and their communities.""
Mr McCartney told the BBC: ""I've lost two friends who took their own lives. I think of them regularly.
""Fundamentally I believe we must do more to lower the suicide rate for no other reason than it's in all of our interests to do so.""
He is calling for a Commons debate on how the government can work with charities, like the Samaritans, to achieve the lowest ever recorded suicide rate.
He said: ""Suicide is the biggest killer of young men in Britain today. It needs to be addressed the same way as any other illness.
""I would like to see a recommitment to improving mental health and wellbeing outcomes, particularly for people who experience worse outcomes than the general population.""
former health Secretary, Sajid Javid, has supported a digital suicide prevention service called 'Shout'.
Shout is a free, confidential and 24/7 text messaging support service for anyone who is struggling.
He spoke at an event launching a report that looked at the cost efficacy of the charity ""Shout"" as a suicide prevention service. 
Mr Javid said: ""Every 90 minutes someone loses their life to suicide. This report is not only timely but needed.""
report aims to estimate the number of lives saved by Shout and the cost savings to the UK economy.
Suicide is the most common reason those under 18 text Shout, accounting for 37% of their conversations. 
NHS Five Year Forward View for Mental Health was published in 2016 included a commitment to reduce the rate of suicides in England by 10% by 2020 compared to 2015 levels. 
However, the suicide rate in England in 2020 was almost the same as the 2015 rate.
government have said they understand the negative impact financial troubles can have on a person's mental health.
A government spokesperson said: ""Our Breathing Space scheme has protected over 100,000 people from charges, distressing letters and bailiff visits, giving them time to find a debt solution that works for them. 
""We are already investing £2.3bn a year by 2023/24 into mental health services, meaning an additional 345,000 children and young people will be able to access NHS-funded mental health support they need by 2024.""
government have also provided £79 million in funding to expand children's mental health services. 
Breathing Space scheme protections means people in mental health crisis treatment have legal protections from their creditors, for the full duration of their crisis treatment plus another 30 days. "	/news/uk-politics-63200639
business	UK government to bring in e-scooter law	"government has said new rules to expand legal use of e-scooters are a priority for the upcoming year.
It also said it would legislate to create a new body to oversee UK railways and ban ferries that do not pay workers the equivalent of minimum wage from docking at UK ports.
government outlined the plans in the Queen's Speech on Tuesday.
E-scooters are widely sold and seen, but are currently only legal on private land or from government hire schemes.
""While riding a privately owned e-scooter on public land is currently illegal, we are considering how best to design future regulations and our Transport Bill will help us to take the steps we need to make e-scooters safer and support innovation,"" a government spokeswoman said.
Official rental trial schemes have been set up in more than 30 areas across England. E-scooters in these trials are limited to 15.5mph and have automatic lights as safety features.
""Safety will always be our top priority and our trials are helping us to better understand the benefits of properly regulated, safety-tested e-scooters and their impact on public space,"" a spokeswoman said.
Private e-scooters are widely sold, prompting concerns about illegal and unsafe use.
On 27 April, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs he would ""crack down"" on illegal e-scooter sales in England.
But he also hinted that models that did meet government standards could soon be legalised for use on public roads in England.
AA's president Edmund King said ""With e-scooters and other forms of micro-mobility popping up more frequently on UK roads, it makes sense that safety regulation should come first.
""If introduced alongside appropriate infrastructure, e-mobility could help provide a positive shift in greener localised travel both for individuals and last-mile freight.""
Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) said it was critical the government considered the needs of people who are blind or partially sighted.  
Moussa Haddad, a policy manager for the charity, said: ""E-scooters are fast-moving, operate quietly, making them difficult to detect, and are often ridden on pavements despite rules prohibiting this.
""Because of this, they pose particular risks for blind and partially sighted pedestrians.""
rity said it was working with the Department for Transport, local councils and e-scooter operators to try to address these concerns.
""Making e-scooters more visually and audibly detectable will help reduce the risks these vehicles pose but these are only some of the solutions that are being explored,"" Mr Haddad added.
In December, Transport for London introduced a ban on e-scooters and e-unicycles on its network, after a number of fires caused by the devices.
reation of a new public sector body to oversee Britain's railways was also included in the Queen's Speech.
Great British Railways (GBR) will ""simplify"" the rail network and improve services for passengers, according to a Downing Street briefing document on the Transport Bill.
It will incorporate the state-owned Network Rail and take on responsibilities from the Department for Transport.
GBR will issue passenger service contracts to private companies to run trains.
riefing document stated that it will ""act as the single national leader of the railways"", with ""a clear mandate, goals and budgets set by the government, who will reserve powers of direction"".
recommendations of a review of the rail industry carried out by former British Airways chief executive Keith Williams following the chaotic introduction of new timetables in May 2018.
In addition, new legislation will seek to ban ferries that do not pay their workers the equivalent of the minimum wage from docking at UK ports.
government said tens of thousands of seafarers will benefit from measures to ensure they are paid the national minimum wage, in the wake of the row over P&O Ferries sacking almost 800 workers.
Ministers said it was a ""major step forward"" on pay protection, but the TUC described the proposals as ""feeble and unworkable.""
Under the reforms, ferry operators who regularly call at UK ports will be required to pay their workers the equivalent of the UK national minimum wage.
government said it will implement the changes in the next parliamentary session and will consult with ports and the maritime sector over the next four weeks.
Options under consideration include surcharges, suspension of port access and fines.
ransport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""We will stop at nothing to make sure seafarers in UK ports are being paid fairly.
""P&O Ferries' disgraceful actions do not represent the principles of our world-leading maritime sector, and changing the law on seafarer pay protection is a clear signal to everyone that we will not tolerate economic abuse of workers.
""We will protect all seafarers regularly sailing in and out of UK ports and ensure they are not priced out of a job.
""Ferry operators which regularly call at UK ports will face consequences if they do not pay their workers fairly.""
But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said stronger rules were necessary.
""The government has done nothing to tackle the most flagrant labour abuse in years by P&O,"" she said.
""Only stronger employment legislation that boosts worker protections and stops companies firing on the spot will prevent another P&O-type scandal.""
Richard Ballantyne, chief executive at the British Ports Association, said ports regulating ships in such a way would be unprecedented.
""Enforcing the minimum wage is not an area where ports have a core competency,"" he said. ""This should be a job for the Maritime & Coastguard Agency or HM Revenue & Customs."""	/news/business-61354078

business	Liz Truss: Ministers working on energy-saving plan	"government is working on a plan to help individuals and businesses use energy more efficiently, Prime Minister Liz Truss has said. 
On Sunday, a minister told the BBC a public information campaign to help people cut their energy use was pulled by No 10 on the grounds of cost. 
But the government now appears to have rowed back on that position. 
Energy regulator Ofgem has warned of ""a significant risk"" of gas shortages this winter due to the war in Ukraine. 
government has sought to limit soaring energy costs for households following the invasion by a price cap on energy, which would keep the average bill to around £2,500 a year. 
rgy and cut costs, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Beis) had been preparing plans for a public information campaign.
But the PM was previously reported to have been ""ideologically opposed"" to the campaign, fearing it would be too interventionist. 
On Wednesday, Downing Street said the Beis plans would now be incorporated into an existing scheme. 
During Prime Minister's Questions, Ms Truss was urged by Conservative MP Guy Opperman ""to have a nationwide mailout campaign"" on reduction of energy use. 
In response the PM said Mr Opperman was ""absolutely right"". 
""I know the energy secretary is working on a plan to help companies and individuals use energy more efficiently. We're also working on this across government,"" she said. ""I hope we'll be able to start this going in Number 10 straight away."" 
rime minister's official spokesman said the government was considering how to ""further expand"" the existing ""help for households"" website, which includes advice on cost-of-living support and improving energy efficiency. 
Cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC on Sunday that a public information campaign would have cost up to £15m. 
He said such a campaign was unnecessary because similar work was already been done by National Grid and Ofgem. 
ruption of gas flows from Russia to Europe has led to concerns about energy supplies this winter. 
Although the UK is far less reliant on Russian gas than mainland Europe, it could still suffer knock-on effects from shortfalls in overall supply. 
In a worst-case scenario National Grid, which manages Britain's electricity and gas supply, has warned households could lose power for up to three hours at a time this winter if gas supplies run extremely low. 
Although the company said this was ""unlikely"" it said supply interruptions were a possibility if the energy crisis escalates. "	/news/uk-politics-63231895
politics	UK yet to see full impact of Brexit trade deals, says minister Badenoch	"full impact of Brexit on trade is ""yet to be seen"", International Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch has said.
Speaking to MPs, she acknowledged ""all change is difficult"" but said the UK could benefit from making its own trade deals with other countries. 
minister also defended the UK's deal with Australia, against fierce criticism from former Environment Secretary George Eustice.
Earlier this month, he accused the government of giving away ""too much"".
Ms Badenoch said she disagreed and that it wasn't right to talk as if the agreement would ""ruin our economy"".
""The deal isn't even in place yet and we're already talking it down,"" she told the international trade committee.
free trade agreement with Australia was the first post-Brexit deal negotiated from scratch. 
Leaving the EU gave the UK the freedom to negotiate its own trade deals, and since Brexit, the UK has signed agreements with 71 countries.
However, the majority of these are simply ""rollovers"" - meaning they copied the terms of deals the UK previously had when it was an EU member, rather than creating new trading arrangements.
Ms Badenoch argued that Brexit gave the UK the opportunity to pursue deals with growing markets in Asia-Pacific. 
However, the government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has recently warned that Brexit was having a ""significantly adverse impact"" on UK trade.
During a question session with the International Trade Committee, Ms Badenoch was pressed on the impact of Brexit on the UK's trade performance, with Conservative Mark Garnier expressing concern that the UK had lower export figures than other advanced economies. 
Ms Badenoch acknowledge that, on exports, the UK ""should be doing better"" but was recovering from global factors such as Covid and the war in Ukraine. 
She argued the UK only fully left the EU at the beginning of 2020 and that ""the full impact of what we're going to see post-Brexit and all of the free trade agreements is yet to be seen.""
""There is a whole world out there - just looking inward and saying 'there is nothing happening except in the EU' is just not realistic.
""It's the 21st century and other countries all across the globe are growing - we need to strengthen our relationships with them, not pretend they don't exist."" 
Earlier this month, Mr Eustice strongly attacked the UK's agreement with Australia, accusing the government of giving ""far too much for far too little in return"".
He argued that then-International Trade Secretary Liz Truss had put the UK ""on the back foot"" by insisting the terms of a deal had to be agreed before a G7 summit in June  2021.
Asked about her colleague's comments, Ms Badenoch said she disagreed with ""almost all"" of Mr Eustice's arguments and insisted the UK hadn't ""given anything away"".
She attacked critics of the deal adding that the UK was ""barely getting through the Australia deal, with all the negativity we are getting"".
However, she did agree with Mr Eustice about the danger of setting hard deadlines for achieving trade deals.
She told the committee she had differed from Ms Truss, when she was prime minister, over the need to reach a free trade agreement with India by Diwali. 
She said the current Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, concurred with her about the need for ""quality over speed"" during trade negotiations. 
On the possibility of reaching a trade agreement with the US, Ms Badenoch said President Joe Biden had been clear he didn't want to do a deal with any country.
""That is not about the UK,"" she said adding that the two countries could still work together on removing tariffs, despite the absence of an agreement.
minister sought to downplay the importance of free trade agreements, arguing that it didn't in itself mean trade couldn't take place. 
""I would like us to move away from the Department for International Trade being seen as the department for free trade agreements and back to the department for international trade,"" she said."	/news/uk-politics-63810914
health	William Harvey Hospital withdraws gas and air for women in labour	"A maternity department has suspended its provision of gas and air, the most common method of pain relief, to women in labour.
William Harvey Hospital in Ashford withdrew the painkiller because of ventilation issues in its labour rooms.

business	Heathrow tells airlines to stop selling summer tickets	"Heathrow Airport has told airlines to stop selling summer tickets, as the UK's biggest airport struggles to cope with the rebound in air travel.
rport is limiting the number of passengers who can depart each day over the peak summer months to 100,000, 4,000 fewer than currently scheduled.
ger numbers will be in place from now until 11 September.
usands of UK travellers have been affected by disruption in recent weeks, including last-minute cancellations.
Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during Covid lockdowns, have struggled to recruit staff as demand for holidays has returned. The UK is about to enter the key summer holiday season as schools begin to break up.
Consumer group Which? urged Heathrow to clarify which flights would be cancelled as a result of the latest announcement.
""While this cap may ease the unacceptable chaos passengers are facing at the UK's biggest airport, thousands of people will now be worrying about whether their flight or holiday plans are about to fall apart,"" said Guy Hobbs, acting editor of Which? Travel.
""Heathrow must work with airlines to quickly provide clarity on which flights are being cut, and airlines need to be upfront with those passengers affected about their right to be rebooked at the earliest opportunity, including on services from other airlines.""
A Heathrow spokesperson said it would take ""a couple of days"" for airlines to work with the scheduling company, Airport Coordination Limited, to decide what changes would be needed.
Ministers told carriers to review their plans after chaos in May, blamed on a shortage of airline and airport staff.
In addition, a temporary government ""amnesty"" to the rules on airport slots was put in place, allowing airlines to change their summer schedules without facing a potential penalty.
But despite this, Heathrow said airlines were still planning to operate flights carrying more daily passengers than could be processed in an acceptable manner.
""Over the past few weeks, as departing passenger numbers have regularly exceeded 100,000 a day, we have started to see periods when service drops to a level that is not acceptable: long queue times, delays for passengers requiring assistance, bags not travelling with passengers or arriving late, low punctuality and last-minute cancellations,"" said Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye.
""Our assessment is that the maximum number of daily departing passengers that airlines, airline ground handlers and the airport can collectively serve over the summer is no more than 100,000.
""The latest forecasts indicate that even despite the amnesty, daily departing seats over the summer will average 104,000 - giving a daily excess of 4,000 seats. On average only about 1,500 of these 4,000 daily seats have currently been sold to passengers, and so we are asking our airline partners to stop selling summer tickets to limit the impact on passengers.""
But Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association and a former head of British Airways (BA), was sharply critical of Heathrow's move.
""To tell airlines to stop selling - what a ridiculous thing for an airport to say to an airline,"" Mr Walsh told Reuters.
""I am surprised Heathrow have not been able to get their act together better than this. Airlines have been predicting stronger traffic than Heathrow has been predicting... they clearly got it completely wrong.""
He added: ""Heathrow are trying to maximise the profitability that they get from the airport at the expense of airlines.""
It's a painful admission for Heathrow - but one that could be considered inevitable.
rport has been struggling to cope with a surge in passengers, following the removal of Covid-related travel restrictions.
results haven't been pretty. Long queues, delays, last-minute cancellations, busloads of orphaned bags and plenty of very angry travellers.
Staff shortages have been a key problem - although Heathrow places most of the blame on airlines for failing to bring in enough ground handling workers.
But some airline people tell a very different story.
m Heathrow drastically underestimated passenger numbers, despite plenty of warnings, and accuse the airport of ""terrible mismanagement"".
It has even been suggested Heathrow deliberately ""lowballed"" its passenger forecasts, as part of a campaign for permission to raise charges on airlines.
Heathrow isn't alone in introducing restrictions. Gatwick imposed a lid on daily flights several weeks ago.
But its move looks set to cause further aggravation for travellers during what has already become a pretty miserable summer.
Heathrow's passenger numbers have continued to rise as it recovers from the pandemic.
But they are still below pre-coronavirus levels, when the airport saw roughly 110,000 to 125,000 daily departures.
Mr Holland-Kaye apologised to passengers whose travel plans might be affected by the move.
""But this is the right thing to do to provide a better, more reliable journey and to keep everyone working at the airport safe.""
Virgin Atlantic said it ""stands ready to deliver its full schedule this summer"".
""However, we support proactive measures being taken by Heathrow to reduce disruption, as long as action proposed does not disproportionately impact home carriers at the airport.
""Action should be based on thorough analysis showing the most effective measures to improve the situation and keep customers moving.""

business	Why more people are working from home on Fridays	"When Tamara Siddiqui works from home on a Friday she feels ready for the weekend as soon as she's done.
It's no wonder it's the UK's most popular remote working day, with just 13% of staff going into the office, according to a new survey.
Some bosses say they have to offer flexible working to attract and keep workers amid severe staff shortages.
But the shift is hitting city centre businesses hard and Friday after work drinks could be fizzling out.
Colleagues rounding off the week in the pub ""used to be the mainstay of British after work culture,"" said Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association.
But the post-pandemic move to working from home on Fridays ""has been hugely damaging"" for bars, restaurants and clubs, he said.
One in seven pubs and restaurants have been lost in the City of London since the pandemic, according to a market recovery monitor from CGA by NielsenIQ and AlixPartners.
""Changing habits have lost businesses billions in revenue, with many having to rethink current business models to accommodate the market,"" Mr Kill said.
For Ms Siddiqui, working remotely some Fridays gives her the ""perfect balance"". It means she is ""ready for the weekend when I finish work, rather than having to commute home"".
29-year-old works for Manchester-based digital marketing agency Embryo. She works three days and every other Friday from home - a pattern she introduced since the pandemic.
""Often I'll have plans on a Friday evening, which I prefer to agree to if I've been working from home that day - it means I'll have more time and energy and can be 'ready to go' earlier,"" she said.
Ms Siddiqui added working from home also allowed her to ""get things done around the house"" before work and on her lunch break. It also saves her money on fuel and parking.
However, she and many of her colleagues do like being in the office every other Friday for after work drinks, she said.
UK staff are now going into offices an average of 1.4 days a week, compared to 3.8 days a week pre-pandemic, research from consultancy Advanced Workplace Associates found.
Although, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) says the majority of people do not work from home.
ft to home working on Fridays has caused a drop in commuter traffic and passenger numbers of trains, which have reduced since before Covid. 
Nicholas Lyes, RAC head of roads policy, said its research suggested drivers were combining ""two consecutive days in the office with homeworking either side because it's more convenient for them"".
rising cost of living has also prompted some people to opt for working from home to cut back on spending on transport and lunches.
Gareth Waters, co-director of marketing agency Alliance in Newport, Wales, said he offered staff the chance to work from home on Fridays to help them save money.
""Some members of staff were averaging 40 miles a day commuting by car, so allowing them to work from home at least one day per week would have an instant impact for them financially.""
Mr Waters said there had been ""no detrimental effect on the day-to-day running of the business"". He said he was considering a hybrid approach with more days from home.
Brendan Kilpatrick, a senior partner at large architecture firm PRP, introduced a one-day from home policy, in which most workers pick a Friday - including him.
He said following the pandemic businesses had to offer more flexible working as job vacancies far outnumbered workers and there was tough competition from other firms.
He said one thing that ""hurts businesses most"" was high turnovers of staff.
""We're training them [our staff] on the job, if they leave after two years that's a chronic waste of investment, he said. ""We are having to be more flexible in that area of the business.""
Mr Kilpatrick said the nature of architecture being a mix of creative design and engineering meant there had to be collaboration in offices to come up with ideas and to reduce the risk of mistakes.
But he added the company had to adapt its policy to be attractive for recruits.
Mr Kilpatrick admitted there had been one or two instances where staff were ""MIA [missing in action] so to speak"", but he said the company had ""not made a big thing about it"".
""It seems to be working well for most people. We have not set any monitoring things, it is about trust - you have to trust your workforce.""
However, one of the UK's largest retail businesses, Frasers Group, rowed back on its work from home Fridays policy.
Office staff at the company, owned by Mike Ashley, were told they could no longer work remotely in July after a memo said some were ""not treating Friday as a working day"".
Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), an association for human resource professionals, said two fifths of firms were planning to to invest more in hybrid working.
Claire McCartney, senior resourcing adviser for the CIPD, said on the whole, employers thought the shift to hybrid working and home working had ""increased productivity rather than decreased it"".
But she said ""ultimately, there's no one-size-fits-all approach"", with the ""organisational and sector context will decide what best suits different businesses""."	/news/business-62560520
technology	West Berkshire Council pushes back on new 5G masts	"A council will force telecoms companies to go through a tougher planning process for more phone masts following local opposition.
government relaxed planning restrictions this year to speed up the rollout of 4G and 5G across England.
It meant taller and broader masts could be installed without the need for council approval.
But West Berkshire Council has refused recent applications to avoid the full planning process in Newbury and Purley.
uncil argued the new masts would have a negative impact on the surrounding area, were the wrong colour and were a danger to road safety.
Rejecting plans for one 20m high mast at the junction of Shaw Road and Kiln Road in Newbury, council planners said it would have a ""detrimental impact"" on the appearance of local conservation areas and nearby listed buildings.
But some residents affected by the masts are not confident the council can stop the structures being erected.
Under national legislation, phone masts can be granted planning permission without the need to submit a planning application, known as ""permitted development"".
ms firms are only required to submit an application to the local planning authority for its ""prior approval"".
what has been denied by West Berkshire Council.
However, changes to the law in April mean operators can also now install higher and broader 5G masts without council approval.
Masts installed on buildings outside of conservation areas - and less than six metres above the top of the building - do not require full planning permission or prior approval by the council.
updated rules also allow the installation of new masts up to 30m in height above ground level on unprotected land, or 25m in a conservation area or site of special scientific interest.
""It makes a mockery of the planning rules,"" said resident Brian Withers.
Antony Walls, who also lives locally, expressed concern over the proposed site for a mast close to a nursery and schools.
""It would seem the position suggested was done purely on company profits and no real evidence has been given for other possible locations,"" he said.

health	Bristol: Single women and transgender people to get fertility treatment	"Fertility treatment will be extended to single women and transgender people on the NHS in Bristol for the first time.
Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire Integrated Care Board approved a new policy after hearing the existing one was open to legal challenge under the Equality Act.
At present only straight or gay couples are eligible for the service.
maximum age for prospective mothers will also be lowered from 40 to 39.
Board members heard the decision to reduce the female upper age limit was based on evidence about the much lower effectiveness of treatment for women over 40.
NHS data from 2019 shows successful live births resulted from 19 per cent of women aged 38 and 39 who underwent IVF, compared with 11 per cent aged 40 to 42.
Men aged up to 54 will still be eligible under the changes.
w policy will come into effect from 1 April, and follows a review launched in March 2021 that gained the views of 438 people and organisations.
It involved consultations with local fertility specialists and a 12-week public engagement which asked what the priorities should be in the local approach to funding infertility treatment.

business	Heathrow Airport cuts flights and warns more could come	"Heathrow Airport has apologised to passengers caught up in recent travel chaos but warned that more flights could be cancelled.
UK's largest airport asked airlines to remove 61 flights from Monday's schedules, as it seeks to cope with soaring demand and staff shortages.
Heathrow's boss John Holland-Kaye said the airport would request ""further action if necessary"".
f thousands of UK passengers have been affected by travel disruption.  
Airports and airlines have struggled to recruit staff after shedding jobs during Covid lockdowns as holiday demand has returned. The UK is about to enter the key summer holiday season as schools begin to break up. 
government and the aviation regulator wrote to carriers last month telling them to ensure their summer timetables were ""deliverable"".
Last week, British Airways said it was cutting 10,300 more short-haul flights between August and the end of October. The announcement, affecting Heathrow, Gatwick and City airports, means nearly 30,000 flights will have been removed from BA's schedule between April and October this year.
Heathrow apologised to passengers affected by ""long queue times, delays for passengers with reduced mobility, bags not travelling with passengers or arriving late"", at times in recent weeks.
But it insisted most passengers had a good level of service, despite resourcing challenges at the airport, airlines, ground handlers and government agencies.
Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""I am very proud of the way that our team is rising to the challenge of growth, and giving excellent service to the vast majority of passengers.
""However, we have already seen times recently when demand exceeds the capacity of the airport, airlines and ground handlers.  
""We will review the schedule changes that airlines have submitted in response to the government's requirement to minimise disruption for passengers this summer and will ask them to take further action if necessary.""
Heathrow said it had asked airlines to remove 61 flights from Monday's schedules, because more passengers are expected in Terminals 3 and 5 than the airport can currently serve.
Previous ""schedule interventions"" happened following problems with a baggage system, and because more passengers were expected than security staffing could cope with.
Heathrow said nearly six million passengers used the airport in June.
Another hint that cancellations may not be over, just as the summer holidays are about to take off.
Airlines say the advance cancellations they've already made should make the peak schedules more reliable and minimise the chances of last minute disruption.
For example, British Airways said last week it would take out more than 10,000 flights, between August and October. It hopes that will be the last such wave of cuts.
But Heathrow is clear today it will review airlines' schedule-trimming and ask them to do more if necessary.
rport has already made a number of ""schedule interventions"" at short notice, asking airlines to remove a relatively small number of services the following day.
Aviation businesses insist they're doing everything in their control to improve things, but no-one can promise a completely disruption-free summer.
re aviation sector has struggled to bounce back from the pandemic, during which it cut thousands of jobs as the industry ground to a halt.
Now that travel has resumed, airlines are seeking to put on almost as many flights as they did before Covid restrictions were introduced while many aviation businesses, for example ground handlers, are finding it difficult to rehire workers.
According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, the number of last-minute flight cancellations from the UK was up 188% in June 2022, compared to June 2019 before the pandemic.
Last month, the Department for Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority wrote a joint letter to carriers, telling them to cancel flights they cannot deliver this summer.
Other airlines have also announced cancellations over the busy summer period.
Low cost European carrier Wizz Air has said it will reduce its peak summer flight programme in an effort to avoid flight cancellations and delays.
Hungarian airline said it would trim its capacity by a further 5%.
Industry bosses have urged the government to allow them to recruit workers from overseas as one potential fix to staff shortages.
Writing in the Sunday Times, Philipp Joeinig, group chief executive of Menzies Aviation, said ministers should add aviation workers to the shortage occupation list as the country enters the peak travel season.
Last month, it was reported that this plea had been rejected by the Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps.

health	Derby puppy that survived parvovirus home for Christmas	"A puppy that nearly died after contracting a virus will be spending his first Christmas with his family at home.
Ralph the cavapoo was just over eight weeks old when he was taken to Scarsdale Vets in Derby with diarrhoea and unusual behaviour.
He was quickly diagnosed with having parvovirus and was ""very touch and go"".
His owner Rebecca Dean said having their ""little fighter"" home would make it a good Christmas.
Mrs Dean, 29, said they had only had Ralph - a cavalier King Charles spaniel/poodle cross - for 24 hours before taking him to the vets on 25 September. 
She said: ""We noticed that he had constant diarrhoea and sickness, not eating and just not being a puppy.
""He started collapsing next to his water bowl.""
Seamus O'Cathail was one of the vets that treated Ralph.
He said: ""It was very quickly identified that he was infected with parvovirus.
""Parvovirus is an intestinal virus - it attacks the small intestines of a dog. Typically it affects young dogs, puppies would be most at risk.
""They can die very quickly from an infection if they're not properly treated.""
Ralph spent about 10 days in intensive care and was very close to developing sepsis.
Mr O'Cathail added: ""For a lot of that time he was very touch and go.""
Mrs Dean said it was ""quite scary"" for her family and she had to explain to her children that Ralph might not be coming home.
However, after a long stay at the vets, Ralph did get better.
Mrs Dean said having him at home this Christmas would be special.
""He's our little fighter. He's got plenty of Christmas presents - he is a very spoilt little doggie.
""It's going to be a very good Christmas,"" she added.

politics	Good Friday Agreement: Claim Sinn Féin considered 'no' campaign in south	"Sinn Féin was prepared to campaign against the Good Friday Agreement in the Republic of Ireland, a former Irish government advisor has alleged.
Martin Mansergh said Sinn Féin considered the move as the agreement removed Ireland's claim over Northern Ireland in its constitution.
He made the claims in an RTÉ documentary called Two Tribes which is due to be broadcast on Wednesday night.
A Sinn Féin spokesperson said the claims were nonsense.
""Sinn Féin negotiated and supported the Good Friday Agreement and campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum,"" they added.
""The party did not plan to run two different referendum campaigns north and south.""
Mr Mansergh, who was an advisor during the peace process, explained how Sinn Féin's planned opposition to the Good Friday Agreement in the Republic of Ireland had worried the Irish government.
""There was a nervousness you could be exposed to Sinn Féin opposition,"" he said.
""They did contemplate supporting the referendum in the north and opposing it in the south.
""They had literature printed against the changes to articles two and three [of the Irish constitution].""
umentary linked the ""nervousness"" within the Irish government about Sinn Féin opposing the Good Friday Agreement to the decision by the then Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern to release four IRA prisoners known as the Balcombe Street gang who were serving life sentences for a string of murders and bomb attacks in England during the 1970s.
On their release the four men then appeared at a Sinn Fein Ard Fheis (conference) in Dublin supporting the Good Friday Agreement.
Mr Ahern told the programme: ""I took the decision that we should release the Balmcombe Street prisoners who had been sent back on the transfer of prisoners.
""They were released in the afternoon and turned up at the Ard Fheis. I think the euphoria made sure we got across the line.""
Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald told the programme Mr Ahern deserved great credit for ""understanding when an opportunity presented, to grab that opportunity and to bring it home"".
At the time the temporary release of the Balcombe Street gang angered the Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble, who feared it would damage unionist support for the Good Friday Agreement in the referendum."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-64057827
technology	Twitter shareholders approve $44bn Musk deal	"witter's shareholders have voted to approve a deal with Elon Musk to buy the company for $44bn (£38bn).   
was made in a short conference call with investors from the company's San Francisco headquarters.
It means Twitter will now try to force Elon Musk to buy the company in the courts. 
meeting followed explosive testimony from Twitter's former head of security Peiter Zatko in front of the US Senate.
In April, Twitter agreed to sell the company to the world's richest person, Elon Musk.
However, the deal soured after Mr Musk alleged he was misled by Twitter about the number of spam and bot accounts on the platform. 
He said he no longer wished to purchase the company in May, but Twitter argues that Mr Musk cannot back out of the deal.
media platform says that fewer than 5% of its monetizable daily active users (those who are able to look at adverts) are bots. Mr Musk argues it could be many times higher. 
witter is currently valued at $32bn, considerably below the $44bn offer from Mr Musk. 
's vote could have spelled the end of Twitter's legal pursuit, but shareholders have now given the company the green light to pursue Mr Musk in court.
wo are set to meet in front of a Delaware state court in October. During the hearing a judge will decide whether or not Mr Musk has to buy the company. 
Just before the shareholder decision, Twitter whistle-blower Pieter Zatko was in Washington testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee about alleged security flaws.
He told US lawmakers the firm was ""misleading the public"" about how secure the platform is.
firm's former head of security went on to say that Twitter was ""a decade behind"" security standards. Twitter says Mr Zatko was fired from his job, and that the claims are inaccurate. 
Mr Zatko has previously supported Elon Musk's claim that the platform has more spam and fake accounts than it has admitted - though he didn't elaborate on this on Tuesday. 
Last week, a judge said that Mr Musk's lawyers would be allowed to use the Twitter whistle-blower's testimony in court. 
It largely focussed on national security issues - and is not officially connected with Mr Musk's attempt to pull out of the deal to buy Twitter."	/news/technology-62894600

entertainment	Joe Lycett defends himself after Qatar hypocrisy charge	"Joe Lycett has defended himself after being accused of hypocrisy over his criticism of David Beckham.
median recently pretended to shred £10,000 in protest of Beckham's links with World Cup host country Qatar, where it is illegal to be gay.
But the Sun highlighted Lycett had been paid for gigs in the country himself earlier in his career.
Lycett argued he never tried to hide the shows and sarcastically referenced the ""spotless morality"" of the Sun.
He added he was paid ""a few hundred quid"" for the shows in 2015 by a UK comedy promoter, and said he would have reconsidered playing the gigs if an equivalent high-profile comedian had shredded money in protest.
Many LGBTQ fans boycotted the recent Fifa men's World Cup over Qatar's treatment of gay people, as same-sex relationships are criminalised in the country.
Last month, Lycett pretended to shred £10,000 in protest over Beckham's promotion of Qatar as an ambassador for the country. It was reported that the former England captain had signed a £10m deal with the World Cup hosts.
median's publicity stunt was widely covered by news outlets and led to him presenting a programme on Channel 4 called Joe Lycett vs Beckham.
But on Thursday, the Sun said Lycett was at ""the centre of a hypocrisy storm"" after it emerged he previously did several performances in controversial Gulf states himself.
median wrote about playing in Dubai, Abu Dhabi - both in the UAE - and Qatar in his autobiography, published in 2016.
In his statement, posted on Twitter, Lycett said: ""Oops! I've been caught out by The Sun! I did two gigs in Doha in 2015 and kept it entirely secret by writing about it in my own book and mentioning it in multiple interviews including with the NY Times!
""If you're interested, I was paid a few hundred quid (not by Qatar but by UK comedy promoters) but it was 2015 and that went a lot further back then. I reckon that if a popular comedian from those days (eg. Shane Ritchie) had shredded a few hundred quid to persuade me not to go, it would have made a difference. But who can say?
""I don't have the perfect hindsight and spotless morality of, to pick a completely random example, The Sun newspaper.""
Some of Lycett's followers had contacted him via social media to draw attention to his gigs. ""You didn't seem to have a problem taking Qatari money that night?"" one said.
In a statement last week, a spokesman for Beckham said: ""We understand that there are different and strongly-held views about engagement in the Middle East, but see it as positive that debate about the key issues has been stimulated directly by the first World Cup being held in the region. 
""We hope that these conversations will lead to greater understanding and empathy towards all people, and that progress will be achieved.""

Inflation in the US is at a four decades-high and the US economy has shrunk for two consecutive quarters.

He said: ""Restoring price stability will take some time and requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance. 
""While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses. These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.""

politics	Scottish parliament apologises after suffragette scarf row	"Alison Johnstone: ""We actively support and promote universal suffrage in a number of ways at Holyrood.""
Scottish Parliament's presiding officer has apologised after a woman was ejected from a committee meeting for refusing to remove a scarf in suffragette colours.
woman was asked to leave a session of the equalities committee, which was discussing proposed reforms to Scotland's gender recognition laws.
Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone later said her removal was an error.
She said suffrage colours were not banned from Holyrood.
woman, who had been sitting in the public seats, tweeted a picture of her green, purple and white scarf shortly after being removed from the meeting of the Equalities, Human Rights and Civil Justice Committee on Tuesday morning. 
Under the Twitter handle Obsolesence, she said: ""I have just been asked to remove my new scarf. I refused because its lovely & inoffensive.
""Apparently (the Scottish Parliament) believes these colours are unacceptable while several MSPs wear rainbow lanyards.""
urs have been associated with the suffragette movement, which campaigned for women to be given the right to vote in the early 20th century. More recently, they have also become associated with those opposed to changes to gender recognition laws.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wore a suffragette scarf to mark the centenary of women winning the right to vote in 2018, and the Scottish Conservatives said items bearing the colours are on sale in the Scottish Parliament gift shop.
Ms Johnstone later told the Holyrood chamber that staff had removed the woman due to visitor rules on ""the display of banners, flags or political slogans, including on clothing and accessories"".
MSPs regularly wear symbols associated with political causes during meetings of the parliament. 
Ms Johnstone told MSPs: ""Let me make one thing crystal clear - suffrage colours are not, and never have been, banned at the Scottish Parliament. 
""We actively support and promote universal suffrage in a number of ways at Holyrood and will continue to do so.""
residing officer said the woman was not ejected as a result of a request from any member of the committee.
She added: ""The action taken was an error, and I would like to apologise on behalf of the Parliament. The wearing of a scarf in those colours does not, in itself, breach the visitor code of conduct.  
""The parliament wishes people to engage with the democratic process, including observing elected representatives debate and make the law of the country."" 
woman's removal had prompted criticism from Conservative MSPs.
Rachael Hamilton, who was wearing suffragette colours in the chamber, thanked the presiding officer for making the clarification.
She said: ""I think it's important that you have confirmed that MSPs are treated exactly the same way as members of the public and the suffragette colours were not in breach of the guidelines set by this parliament.""
SNP MP Joanna Chery - a vocal critic of the gender reforms - tweeted that the removal of the woman was a ""disgraceful episode for Scottish democracy"", adding: ""This is not the Scotland I entered politics to promote. 
""It's completely out of step with what the suffragettes fought for, the spirit of the enlightenment and indeed the founding principles of the Scottish Parliament"". 
qualities committee is currently examining the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill. which aims to make it easier for people to change their legally-recognised gender.

entertainment	Girls Aloud: It's 20 years since pop greats were born on Popstars The Rivals	"Cast your mind back to 2002. The country was celebrating the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II, the Commonwealth Games were held in Manchester, and Davina McCall was live on ITV1 with some important news. 
""Here is the line-up that you have chosen for your girl band,"" she told viewers of Popstars: The Rivals.
It was 30 November, and a band was about to be formed on reality TV.
group would be called Girls Aloud, and the public decided it wanted Cheryl Tweedy, Nicola Roberts, Nadine Coyle, Kimberley Walsh and Sarah Harding to fill the gap in the music industry left by the Spice Girls, and ""to take on the boys"" - One True Voice.
It was a simple TV talent show concept: wannabe singers hoping to be part of two rival groups (the boys and the girls), with judges whittling auditionees down to 10 contenders for each group before letting the public eliminate a performer each Saturday until there were two bands of five left battling it out for 2002's Christmas number one.
""Sound of the Underground was a life changing song for myself and Girls Aloud,"" Kimberley tells BBC News. ""We knew we had hit gold when we heard it for the first time.""
What the public didn't know then: it had chosen five women who would break the pop mould and score more hit singles than any other girl group in UK chart history.
mark the 20th anniversary of their debut, Sound of the Underground, the group are releasing it on vinyl, along with an alternative vocal arrangement. The profits will be donated to The Sarah Harding Breast Cancer appeal - in memory of the 39-year-old band member who died from the disease last year.
In a 2002 review, the BBC claimed the song promised ""a pleasantly surprising antidote to all the worst post-office party hangovers, with enough oomph to blow those cobwebs away"".
""It's amazing, it was our first single 20 years ago and it's still one of our most popular, and most played songs,"" Kimberley says.
""We're all very proud of it and it means a great deal to us.""
For years, Saturday morning children's TV was dominated by the band as they performed hit after infectious hit - like No Good Advice, Wake Me Up, Biology and Something Kinda Ooooh. 
But it was an unlikely choice by the Arctic Monkeys, four days before their debut album was released, to cover the group's single Love Machine in 2006 that brought a whole new audience to Girls Aloud.
""It captured everybody's imagination,"" Jo Whiley, who hosted BBC Radio 1's morning slot at the time, said in 2018. ""Listen up for Alex's laugh. It's my favourite moment in any Live Lounge.""
Frontman Alex Turner told the BBC last month he couldn't remember how it came about - but the two genres of music could be closer than you think. Xenomania, the producers who worked on most of Girls Aloud's hits, told the BBC last year ""pop music was on its knees"" in the early '00's, but the group became ""part of why the world sounds the way it is now"".
Music promoter Luke Joynes put forward the case that Girls Aloud should be celebrated as a guitar band in this comprehensive Twitter thread.
""Pop groups like Girls Aloud paved the way for guitar sounds to be more mainstream back then,"" Joynes believes. ""The more you listen to them, the more you realise how different they sounded to newer girl groups like Little Mix and Fifth Harmony.""
Girls Aloud blurred the lines of what was cool and what pop music should sound like. Nobody would have thought Coldplay would invite some reality show winners to support them on tour. But, along with Jay-Z, Girls Aloud got the crowd in the mood at Wembley Stadium in 2009, with Chris Martin declaring they were ""the ultimate form of life"".
Away from the riffs, lyrics and choreography, there was something about the group that simply represented the mid-noughties in pop, when everything was a bit freer: an era of polyphonic ringtones, charity bracelets and gel pens.
E4 series Girls Aloud: Off The Record followed the band around the UK and in Australia. In the age of cancel culture, it's now hard to imagine any chart-topping act daring to let cameras film as they argued with wardrobe staff, dealt with hangovers and complained about the lack of industry recognition. 
It's one of the reasons clips from the fly-on-the-wall series do so well on TikTok now. People aren't used to pop stars being so honest. Chunks of the documentary are also used in the Gals Aloud drag show.
""They really formed and shaped me to be the artist I am today,"" Drag Race star Cheryl Hole says. ""For a lot of us, Girls Aloud will never not be a thing in our lives. It's the soundtrack to our childhood and I will make sure the next generation know all the choreography to The Promise.""
Seeing Gals Aloud is likely to be the closest a fan can get to seeing the Biology, Can't Speak French and Untouchable singers on stage, because the band split in 2013. 
A 20th anniversary tour was in the works but, following Sarah's death last year, the other four members have made clear they don't feel comfortable performing without her. Instead, they have been hosting events to raise money for cancer treatment, including a Race For Life this summer.
Last year, Little Mix thanked Girls Aloud (as well as the Spice Girls, All Saints and Sugababes) when they became the first all-female act to win best British group at the Brit Awards.
It was something Nicola, Nadine, Kimberley, Cheryl and Sarah had been nominated for twice, losing out to Arctic Monkeys and Elbow.
Instead, Girls Aloud again relied on a public vote to finally claim a Brit in 2009 - winning best British single for The Promise. Having always lost out on categories judged by music insiders, the result reinforced that this was a group the British public not only created, but wanted to succeed. 
Last week I re-watched Popstars: The Rivals and, aside from the minimal production, some off-key performances and dated comments that made me squirm, there was one moment of innocence that stood out. 
Kimberley, then 21, looked into the camera, hoping to get in to the final band but unsure of what was to come: ""I think about how it's going to be, but I don't think any of us really know.""
wenty years on, she tells BBC News: ""It's been an incredibly reflective year for us, for obvious reasons, and it still blows my mind how much support we have from the public, and how much love is still out there for our music.""
On the day Sound of the Underground was released, BBC News reported: ""Over two-thirds of this year's number ones have been from acts hand-picked and groomed for stardom by record company talent spotters, or from TV pop contests. Many are convinced the current fad isn't going to create long-term acts with back catalogues.""
More than 20 singles, five studio albums, two greatest hits compilations and a collection of B-sides that can't be matched later, Girls Aloud really did prove everyone wrong."	/news/entertainment-arts-63570796
politics	UK strikes revised deal with France on Channel migrants	"Watch: Suella Braverman and France's Gérald Darmanin sign migrant patrol deal
UK will pay France £8m more a year under a revised deal to try to stop people crossing the English Channel in small boats.
money will pay for increased surveillance of French beaches, while UK police officers will also be able to observe patrols within France.
It is thought French officers patrolling the coast will rise from about 250 to 350 over five months.
PM Rishi Sunak said he was ""confident"" the crossings could be brought down.
However, he warned there was no ""single thing"" that could ""fix"" the situation, promising ""even greater cooperation"" with France in the months ahead.
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called the deal a ""small step in the right direction,"" but said more needed to be done to tackle people smuggling.
government is coming under increasing pressure to reduce journeys across the Channel, which have risen to record levels this year. 
More than 40,000 people have crossed in small boats so far this year, including 1,800 this weekend alone, according to official figures. 
Under the new agreement, signed by Home Secretary Suella Braverman in Paris, the UK will pay France £63m this year, up from £55m last year.
It will cover:
UK observers will be embedded in French control rooms, and French observers embedded in UK control rooms, to help inform each other's deployments.
Home Secretary Suella Braverman told MPs the deal was a ""very good platform"" for deeper collaboration in the future. 
""I'm not going to overplay this agreement,"" she said, adding: ""Is it going to solve the problem on its own? It won't, but I do encourage everybody to support the deal we have secured.""
's announcement may shift some officers closer to frontline decision-making - but it's not clear how the deal helps the UK to solve three pressing issues. 
Firstly, those new British teams (on top of those deployed since 2018) will only be observers. 
rational powers, so even if more boats and smugglers are intercepted, they can't tell the French what to do with individual migrants who we know may try more than once to cross.
Secondly, some critics say the UK needs to look for a bigger continental-wide deal. But it chose not to be part of the EU's irregular migrant management policies, as part of Brexit. 
final big challenge is on the UK side of the English Channel. The Home Office's day-to-day battle to find somewhere to accommodate those who survive the sea is directly linked to the department's huge backlogs and the delays in dealing with those who arrived before them.
Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the deal, but said there was ""much more that needs to be done"". ""We need the National Crime Agency working upstream to tackle the people smuggling in the first place,"" he told reporters.
He also criticised the ""desperate state"" of asylum application processing in the UK, adding most people would be ""shocked"" by official figures showing that only 4% of asylum claims by migrants who crossed the Channel last year have been processed. 
Franck Dhersin, mayor of Teteghem near the coastal town of Dunkirk, said the increase in crossings this year had come despite ""a lot of police"" watching the coast.
""We are talking about 175km of beaches and dunes, where it is very easy to hide,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 
Natalie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover, called the new deal ""more of the same,"" adding it ""falls far short of what is needed"".
""The only thing that will tackle this issue is making sure that the boats are stopped in France before they get in the water,"" she added.
Refugee Council and Amnesty International UK called for a greater focus on increasing the number of safe and legal routes for people who want to claim asylum in the UK.
gher numbers of migrants making the crossing this year has been partly blamed on a big rise in the number of Albanian nationals making the journey. 
So far this year 12,000 Albanians have arrived in the UK using small boats, compared to just 50 in 2020.
mes after weeks of criticism aimed at the government for severe overcrowding at the migrant processing site in Manston, Kent, and for its spending on housing for those waiting for their asylum applications to be completed. 
According to the Home Office, the UK is spending £5.6m on accommodating asylum seekers in hotels. It is spending a further £1.2m a day to temporarily house Afghan refugees who fled the Taliban.
government figures for the year to the end of June 2022 showed that 103,000 asylum applications were awaiting a decision.
Ms Braverman has previously admitted the system was ""broken"" and Mr Sunak has said not enough asylum claims were being processed.
More than 40,000 people applying for asylum have waited between one and three years for a decision on their claim, according to a Refugee Council Freedom of Information request.
It also reported that a further 725 migrants have been waiting for more than five years to have their claim processed.
It emerged last month there was severe overcrowding at Manston, with 4,000 people staying there rather than the 1,600 for which the site was intended. 
Numbers have since been reduced to less than 1,600, according to immigration minister Robert Jenrick.
On Saturday it emerged people at Manston centre are to be vaccinated against highly contagious and sometimes fatal diphtheria after an outbreak. "	/news/uk-politics-63615653
politics	Rishi Sunak urges allies to boost Ukraine support	"Rishi Sunak has urged European allies to maintain or boost military support for Ukraine over the coming year.
PM kicked off a trip to the Baltic region by announcing the UK would send hundreds of thousands of rounds of artillery ammunition to Ukraine. 
He also said there could not be peace talks until Russia withdrew its troops.
Last week, the BBC reported that the prime minister had asked for an assessment of the progress of the war in Ukraine. 
A Whitehall source told BBC's Newsnight programme: ""Wars aren't won [by dashboards]. Wars are won on instinct. At the start of this it was Boris (Johnson) sitting down and saying: 'Let's just go for this.' So Rishi needs to channel his inner Boris on foreign policy though not of course on anything else.""
Downing Street has insisted Mr Sunak is strongly supportive of Ukraine.
During his trip to eastern Europe, the prime minister also met British troops serving in the Nato military alliance. 
He served mince pieces to soldiers in Estonia and praised their ""selfless dedication and bravery"".
Over the past year, the UK has doubled its presence in the country in response to the build up of Russian troops in Ukraine.
Earlier in the day, Mr Sunak had attended a meeting of the leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Forces (JEF) - a coalition of northern European countries, including Denmark, Estonia, Finland and Latvia.
Addressing the gathering in the Latvian capital Riga, Mr Sunak said it was an ""incredibly important"" time for them to reaffirm their commitment to Ukraine. 
""We must be clear that any unilateral call for a ceasefire by Russia is completely meaningless in the current context.
""I think it would be a false call, it would be used by Russia to regroup, to reinforce their troops and until they have withdrawn from conquered territory, there can and should be no real negotiation.
""But what we can do is think about that time now, think about what we will do with regard to security assurances.""
He added that the group should concentrate on ""degrading Russia's capability to regroup and resupply"".
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky also addressed the meeting, albeit over video link rather than in person. 
He said providing Ukraine with a ""100% air shield"" would be ""one of the most successful steps"" countries could take against Russia. 
He added that Russian missiles had left millions in his country without heat or power. 
Following the summit, Mr Sunak met his Latvian counterpart Krisjanis Karins for talks, during which the pair agreed to work to accelerate trade between their countries. 
Mr Karins tweeted: ""As close and likeminded allies our countries have a shared commitment to regional security and a strong stance in support of Ukraine. Glad we also got to discuss strengthening of economic & high-tech links.""
Mr Sunak then headed to Estonia where he signed a technology partnership with the country's Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas, aimed at improving cooperation on cyber security, connectivity and data."	/news/uk-politics-64027987
sports	European Beach Handball Championships: Norway hit with 1,500 euros bikini fine	"Norway have been fined 1,500 euros (£1,295) for wearing shorts instead of bikini bottoms at the European Beach Handball Championships.
European Handball Federation (EHF) said it had imposed the fineexternal-link because of a case of ""improper clothing"".
Norway's players wore shorts instead of bikini bottoms during a bronze medal match against Spain in Varna, Bulgaria.
Norway's Handball Federation (NHF) had already stated it would pay if their players were fined.
An EHF statement said a disciplinary commission had imposed a fine of ""150 euros per player, for a total of 1,500 euros"".
It added that Norway had played with shorts that are ""not according to the athlete uniform regulations defined in the IHF [International Handball Federation] beach handball rules of the game.""
Kare Geir Lio, the head of NHF, had told news agency AFP any penalty would be paid but added: ""It should be a free choice within a standardised framework.
""The most important thing is to have equipment that athletes are comfortable with.""
And following the decision to fine the players, the NHF said: ""We are very proud of these girls who during the European Championships raised their voices and announced that enough is enough!
""We at NHF stand behind you and support you. Together we will continue to fight to change the rules for clothing, so that players can play in the clothes they are comfortable with.""
Before the Championships, Norway approached the EHF to ask for permission to play in shorts but were told that breaches of the rules were punishable by fines.
A Norwegian motion to amend the current rules will be discussed by the bodies in the coming months.
""The EHF is committed to bring this topic forward in the interest of its member federations - however, it must also be said that a change of the rules can only happen at IHF level,"" said EHF spokesman Andrew Barringer.
ue has been debated in beach sports circles for several years as some players find the bikini both degrading and impractical. 
Norway's Minister for Culture and Sports, Abid Raja, tweeted after Monday's ruling: ""It's completely ridiculous - a change of attitude is needed in the macho and conservative international world of sport.""
President of the Norwegian Volleyball Federation, Eirik Sordahl, was critical too, telling national news agency NTB: ""In 2021, it shouldn't even be an issue."""	/sport/handball/57890430
entertainment	Cashy C's: The musical staging working class stories in a pawnbrokers shop	"Most plays start when the curtain goes up in a theatre. But Cashy C's: The Musical begins when the metal security shutter rises on the front of a pawnbrokers shop.
Once the blue shutter has cranked up, an actor leads the audience inside, where they find their seats surrounded by shelves holding old TVs, toasters, turntables, tool kits, fans, guitars, lamps, a battered printer and a kettle.
We meet a staff member who must deal with customers in varying degrees of desperation and dodginess, and who is powerless to avoid being pulled into a precarious situation himself.
Between the play's scenes, a rapper emerges from a DJ booth to deliver his musical commentary on the drama unfolding on the shop floor.
Outside, real shoppers walk past the shop window as they go about their business in Bradford city centre, oblivious to the fact they are what the show's producer Rosie Freeman jokingly describes as ""our amazing extras"".
rew are prepared for some to accidentally wander in during performances, as they have done during rehearsals, not realising it's not currently a real shop.
""They could steal the show at times, I think,"" laughs writer and director Kirsty Taylor.
used to be a frozen food shop, but was empty and has now been kitted out as a pawnbrokers to provide the setting for Cashy C's: The Musical. The name is a thinly veiled reference to a particular pawn shop chain.
""The idea came from being in a Cash Converters, a specific one in Bradford, a big one,"" Taylor explains.
""The staff were really engaging. Some people were just bringing in Xbox games because teenagers wanted a bit of money.
""And then when I looked into the back, there were people's kettles and things that people were temporarily selling - things that were important to them, or actually just household objects, or their kids' Christmas presents that they've had to resell, that they're then going to buy back for more money.
""That made me just start to think what a setting it could be.""
Every kitchen essential or children's toy could tell a story about why someone needed to trade it in before buying it back later with interest.
makes a pawn shop a rich setting for bringing together underlying themes about poverty, debt, crime, health inequality and addiction, Taylor says. ""The list of things which other people, if you're not maybe from this background and don't live within these areas, have no idea about.""
And although the story's set in Bradford, she says it would be relevant to people in any city.
r has been working on the show for several years, but it has become more topical as the cost of living crisis has begun to bite.
""As the play developed, the situation for the context for the play got much worse,"" she says.
""I actually couldn't have imagined that it would get any worse. And it got worse and worse, and here we are, like in the peak of… I don't know if it's the peak because it's probably going to go on for however long.""
For research, Taylor spoke to real pawn shop staff, who told her those using their services are not just the ""stereotypical characters that you might expect to see"".
""The people who are actually using these services are everyday people,"" she says.
""One kept saying about this train driver. It's people who've got various different kinds of jobs. It's not just unemployed people. It's not just people with five kids. Not that it should not be OK for them.""
Despite its themes, the writer doesn't want her show to just be poverty pawn porn.
She is fiercely proud of her home city, and made her name writing and performing poems that are love letters to Bradford, warts and all.
""As well as the bleak themes, it is a celebration of Bradford and working class culture and character and wit and humour, and how we speak to each other,"" Taylor says of her play. ""And music as well. Music is such a big part of it.""
Bradford has a booming rap and bassline scene, and the show's music has been written by Taylor and Jae Depz, with rapper Ty Richards starring as the narrator.
Rather than make a traditional trailer, Richards fronted a music video to promote the show, and he thinks that - and the fact it is being staged in a shop - helped it appeal to people who wouldn't normally go to a theatre. Tickets for the Bradford shows sold out in less than 24 hours.
rapper says the story resonates with him. ""I think [it is successfully] getting the people I grew up around, growing up on an estate, being around the themes of poverty, crime, drug use.
""But it's also the unique characters, the community aspect of it, the warmness, the fact that everyone knows each other, the gossip that goes round, the role models, the people that you look up to that can help you out of situations.
""There's that balance of the negative aspects that you want to shine a light on, but then there's the positives of growing up in working-class communities. It's exactly how I grew up.""
r admits she wrestled with whether the show is perpetuating working-class stereotypes.
""When I chat to people and we're living this life, and we are here, I really wanted the play to be honest,"" she says.
""I didn't want it to glamorise working class lifestyle or crime, but be really honest about some of it. So the characters aren't perfect. Because we aren't, are we?""
Bradford - and Taylor - are likely to get more of the spotlight when it is the next UK City of Culture in 2025. That title is ""just about opportunity"", the writer says.
""It's about Bradford being on the news and in the media for something positive, and for people to get an opportunity to try stuff out, to see what they like, to find out what they're good at, to have an opportunity for things to be going on in this city.""
With Cashy C's, the writer joins the ranks of Bradford dramatists who have given an affectionate but unvarnished view of their city, following Rita, Sue and Bob Too playwright Andrea Dunbar and film-maker Clio Barnard, whose latest release Ali and Ava was nominated for best British film at this year's Baftas.
""I've just always had a fascination for Bradford people and stories,"" Taylor adds. As she speaks, people drop off more second-hand goods to fill the shelves for the show.
""There are stories behind all the characters that could all probably relate to real people I know or I've met or my family.
""I work a lot in school settings and community settings, and this shop is the window to Bradford.
""We're meeting these characters and people all the time. It is a reality for us. And I was just interested in how to tell some of those stories.""
Cashy C's: The Musical is in Bradford until 7 October, and in Keighley from 21-23 October."	/news/entertainment-arts-63021582

""I was making sure I wasn't going home tonight,"" Rock told Sky Sports. 
""I played OK in the first set but that second set I played absolutely dreadful and I walked off the stage, looked at my fiancee and said 'wake up, Josh'. I knew what I had to do."" 
Rock's next opponent will be England's Callan Rydz. 
Four-time women's world champion Lisa Ashton almost completed a comeback in her first-round match against Ryan Meikle but was eventually defeated 3-2 by the Englishman.

health	OCD: How to cope over Christmas and New Year	"Over the festive period Sam Jones would love to be able to hug his mum but he's not sure if he can. 
35-year-old is one of an estimated 750,000 people in the UK with the serious anxiety-related condition obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
He has Harm OCD, which means he has ""deeply upsetting"" and ""very, very graphic"" violent and sexual intrusive thoughts of harming others.
Hugging some people, including his mother, can trigger those thoughts. 
""The most painful thing is sometimes I really want to give my mum a hug and I can't do it and you just feel like a rubbish person because of it,"" he said.
""You really genuinely feel like you might cause some harm to them or something."" 
He said it starts with a difficult thought about hurting someone.
followed by a fear that he will carry out that action.  
""Then the anxiety will rise and as that rises and rises you feel compelled to perform these compulsions, to sort of quell that anxiety and keep confirming to yourself, 'I'm a good person, I'm a good person',"" he explained. 
Sam said he often found it difficult to hug women and children as he worries he is going to harm them.  
g and changes of routine at Christmas can exacerbate Sam's intrusive thoughts.
""It's going out to the shop... being around lots of people,"" he said. 
""To spend the whole time extremely tense and just wanting to get out of there - but not wanting to get out of the room - it's really hard, it's really upsetting,"" he said. 
""Of course you can get labelled as grumpy of a bit of a recluse and that adds to the shame that you're already feeling."" 
Sam does not drink alcohol. 
He said: ""That's something that will spike my symptoms because of that feeling of being out of control.""
Getting ready for a Christmas event might also be all the more challenging for Sam. On a bad day it can take him up to 45 minutes to put a jumper on as he feels compelled to take it on and off until it feels right.
When Sam was 29 he said he hit rock bottom and felt suicidal. 
At the time he was experiencing a relationship OCD and said he was repeatedly asking himself, ""Am I in love? Is this real love? Am I leading this person on?""
He said ""it can take over your life"".
He went to his GP which eventually led to his diagnosis. He was treated with a form of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with exposure and response prevention (ERP) and peer support groups. 
Sam said he also armed himself with information from OCD Action, OCD UK and The OCD Stories podcast. 
""I still have really hard days where I really struggle and I have days when it's fantastic,"" he said. 
re are many types of OCD, most of which can be made more challenging by Christmas, Sam said. 
He said for instance someone with contamination OCD, where someone obsesses over catching an illness or spreading germs, will find it hard to visit people's homes, hugging, eating food prepared by others or being in a big group.
Someone with religious OCD, where they have obsessive religious doubts and fears or unwanted blasphemous thoughts and images, cold be triggered by the religious symbolism and rituals of Christmas. 
Sam has heard people using the term OCD flippantly, as a joke or in a way that trivialises the condition, something he finds ""deeply upsetting"".
""It affects you a very visceral level.
""If you see an Obsessive Christmas Disorder jumper or something... it just makes you feel really angry.""
Craig Evans, 30, from Swansea, also has OCD.
He needs everything to feel perfect or ""just right"" to feel comfortable. 
Since his early teens he has been checking things and switching things on and off in multiples of four - he fears if he does not do this something bad will happen. 
His routine involves ensuring light switches are aligned in a particular way and always putting his sock on his left foot before his right. 
He was diagnosed in his mid-20s and said CBT and exposure therapy had helped. 
He finds Christmas particularly challenging because of changes to his routine and seeing more people. 
""Certain rituals and certain routines that I have at the moment, if they get knocked off course that can raise my anxiety levels,"" he said.
""It may be something trivial like I can't have my food in peace or I can't watch my favourite telly program a particular time, that raises my anxiety levels and I have to carry out the cycle with my compulsions.""
He can also find other people's homes difficult.
""For example, glasses not lined up as how I'd wish them to be,"" he said. 
""You get shaky, you get clammy, your heart races, palpitations.""
Sam chose to keep his Christmas small, spending it with just three other people.
He will be focusing on being in the moment, taking walks in nature, exercising and being with his fiancée.
He said the best way to help someone with OCD have an easier Christmas is to educate themselves about the conduction.
Craig also likes to keep things as simple as possible at Christmas.
""If I was to attend lots of different parties and go out and visit a lot I'd find that very difficult to cope with,"" he said. 
He said others could help by accepting there may be times when the person with OCD is not quite themselves.
In support groups Craig said had heard of one person with OCD intentionally overcooking Christmas dinner for fear of poisoning their family.
Another spent Christmas day obsessively cleaning their kitchen.
""The worst thing you can say to them is 'just stop it' - that trivialises it,"" he said. 
""To you it might be ridiculous but to that person that's suffering in that moment it's a very, very distressing.""

Dave Walsh started competing in able-bodied Strongman events after leaving the Army in 2010, and was diagnosed with the condition in 2014.
father-of-three now takes part in disabled events and won World's Strongest Disabled Man in June.
""Family aside, Strongman is all I feel I've got. I put so much into it and get so much from it,"" said Mr Walsh.
Before turning to the sport, Mr Walsh, from Chippenham, said he struggled with his mental health. 
""Strongman brought me out of that depression and it kind of gave me back a bit of confidence.
""It made me focus more on what I can do, rather than what I can't do,"" he said. 
In addition to being unable to walk or stand, he has issues with his hands and sometimes struggles with speech.
""With MS, you never know what's around the corner. For as long as I can I'm going continue to do Strongman. 
""Even if I start to lose the competitions, I still need to be involved with it somehow,"" he added.
Mr Walsh won the World's Strongest Disabled Man event held in Ottawa, Canada, which was held between 17-19 June and intends to defend his title next year.
In order to win the event he had to pull trucks, complete deadlifts, log-lifts and shift sandbags weighing up to 115kg.
""Strongman for me is everything. Obviously family aside, I feel it's all I've got,"" he said.
In September, Mr Walsh will be competing in an event in Birmingham called The Arnolds, with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone due to be in attendance.
""The fact there will be a crowd of over 60,000 makes it that much more special,"" he said.

technology	Optus: How a massive data breach has exposed Australia	"Last week, Australian telecommunications giant Optus revealed about 10 million customers - about 40% of the population - had personal data stolen in what it calls a cyber-attack.
Some experts say it may be the worst data breach in Australia's history.
But this week has seen more dramatic and messy developments - including ransom threats, tense public exchanges and scrutiny over whether this constituted a ""hack"" at all.
It's also ignited critical questions about how Australia handles data and privacy.
Optus - a subsidiary of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd - went public with the breach about 24 hours after it noticed suspicious activity on its network.
Australia's second-largest telecoms provider said current and former customers' data was stolen - including names, birthdates, home addresses, phone and email contacts, and passport and driving licence numbers. It stressed that payment details and account passwords were not compromised.
whose passport or licence numbers were taken - roughly 2.8 million people - are at a ""quite significant"" risk of identity theft and fraud, the government has since said.
Optus said it was investigating the breach and had notified police, financial institutions, and government regulators. The breach appears to have originated overseas, local media reported. 
In an emotional apology, Optus chief executive Kelly Bayer Rosmarin called it a ""sophisticated attack"", saying the company has very strong cybersecurity.
""Obviously, I am angry that there are people out there that want to do this to our customers, and I'm disappointed that we couldn't have prevented it,"" she said on Friday. 
Early on Saturday, an internet user published data samples on an online forum and demanded a ransom of $1m (A$1.5m; £938,000) in cryptocurrency from Optus.
mpany had a week to pay or the other stolen data would be sold off in batches, the person said.
Investigators are yet to verify the user's claims, but some experts quickly said the sample data - which contained about 100 records - appeared legitimate.
Sydney-based tech reporter Jeremy Kirk contacted the purported hacker and said the person gave him a detailed explanation of how they stole the data.
user contradicted Optus's claims the breach was ""sophisticated"", saying they pulled the data from a freely accessible software interface.
""No authenticate needed… All open to internet for any one to use,"" they said in a message, according to Kirk.
In another escalation on Tuesday, the person claiming to be the hacker released 10,000 customer records and reiterated the ransom deadline.
But just hours later, the user apologised - saying it had been a ""mistake"" - and deleted the previously posted data sets.
""Too many eyes. We will not sale [sic] data to anyone,"" they posted. ""Deepest apology to Optus for this. Hope all goes well from this.""
rked speculation about whether Optus had paid the ransom - which the company denies - or whether the user had been spooked by the police investigation.
Adding to the problem, others on the forum had copied the now-deleted data sets, and continued to distribute them.
It also emerged some customers' Medicare details - government identification numbers that could provide access to medical records - had also been stolen, something Optus did not previously disclose. 
Late on Wednesday, the company said this had affected almost 37,000 Medicare cards.  
Optus has been inundated with messages from angry customers since last week. 
People have been warned to watch out for signs of identity theft and for opportunistic scammers, who are said to be already cashing in on the confusion. 
A class-action lawsuit could soon be filed against the company. ""This is potentially the most serious privacy breach in Australian history, both in terms of the number of affected people and the nature of the information disclosed,"" said Ben Zocco from Slater and Gordon Lawyers.
government has called the breach ""unprecedented"" and blamed Optus, saying it ""effectively left the window open"" for sensitive data to be stolen.
In an ABC television interview on Monday, Cyber Security Minister Clare O'Neil was asked: ""You certainly don't seem to be buying the line from Optus that this was a sophisticated attack?""
""Well, it wasn't. So no,"" Ms O'Neil replied. The moment drew lots of attention online. 
Ms Bayer Rosmarin told News Corp Australia on Tuesday: ""We have multiple layers of protection. So it is not the case of having some sort of completely exposed APIs [software interfaces] sitting out there.
""I think most customers understand that we are not the villains,"" she said, adding Optus could not say more while the investigation was ongoing.
mpany has faced calls to cover the costs of replacement passport and driving licences, as people scramble to protect themselves.
reach highlights how much Australia lags behind other parts of the world on privacy and cyber issues, Ms O'Neil says.
""We are probably a decade behind… where we ought to be,"" she told the ABC.
Both sides of politics have traded blame on the issue. Opposition MPs have said the Labor government is ""asleep at the wheel"", but the government points out it was only elected in May after a decade of conservative rule.
Ms O'Neil pointed to two areas needing urgent reform.
She argues the government should be able to better penalise companies like Optus. In some countries, the company would have faced hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties but Australia's fine is capped at about $2m, she said.
She also wants to expand cyber-security laws that were introduced last year to include telecommunications companies.
""At the time, the telecommunications sector said: ""Don't worry about us - we're really good at cybersecurity. We'll do it without being regulated. I would say that this incident really calls that assertion into question.""
Security experts have also suggested reforming data retention laws so telecommunication companies don't have to keep sensitive information for so long. Ex-customers should also have the right to request companies delete their data, experts say.
Optus says it is required to keep identity data for six years under the current rules.
Other industry figures have argued consumers should be able to take companies that lose control of their information to court, instead of the industry regulator."	/news/world-australia-63056838
business	Pensions, savings and mortgages - your questions answered	"Since the announcement of the government's mini-budget in September, financial markets have been in turmoil, with investors concerned about how tax cuts would be paid for.
Some pension funds risked collapse, and the Bank of England had to step in to lower that risk.
Meanwhile, five-year mortgage rates hit 12-year highs. Mortgage rates had been rising for months, but increased sharply after the mini-budget.
BBC personal finance correspondent Kevin Peachey answers your questions about pensions and mortgages.
Heather Wing asks whether, following the deadline from the Bank of England, her occupational pension is safe.
It is correct that the Bank of England has told pension funds that its emergency bond-buying operation will end this week.
rgeted at a specific section of the pensions sector. Importantly, the warning does not extend to the pension savers themselves.
Even if you have a so-called defined benefit pension, that will be safe, experts say.
If one of these pension funds did get into trouble, then the employer is legally obliged to pump money into the scheme. In the unlikely event that doing so puts the employer out of business then there is a safety net called the Pension Protection Fund.
Read more: How safe is my pension?
Andy Atkinson, from Rugby, asks whether he should be worried about his defined contribution and defined benefit pensions.
First things first, some definitions.
A defined contribution pension is when you build up a pot of pension savings which is invested. On retirement, you have various options.
One of those is to buy an annuity with all, or part, of that pot. Recent events mean annuity deals are actually better than they have been for some time.
A defined benefit pension is a bit different. It sees the amount you receive in retirement depend on how long you have been in the scheme and your salary during that time.
Some of the funds which control these pensions have been at the centre of the turbulence of recent days.
However, pensions consultants stress that, whatever type of pension you have, it is safe.
Don Brown wants to know: ""Will the state pension keep up with the cost of living?""
re is some upheaval in the pensions sector at the moment, but that will not affect your state pension.
government has already committed to honouring the triple-lock. So, your state pension next April will rise in line with the highest of inflation, wages, or 2.5%.
Inflation - the annual rate of rising prices - will clearly be the highest, at about 10% or so. We will get that number next week, when the next set of official inflation figures is published.
Of course, pensioners are facing higher prices now, but the backstop of the triple lock always lags behind the current situation - for better or worse.
Moving on to mortgages, Callum, from Leeds, is saving for a first home and wants to know what help is available.
He says: ""I make just under £1,500 a month after tax. National Insurance and Income Tax reductions will only save me £16 a month, meanwhile prices of everything are skyrocketing.""
Clearly as you watch mortgages getting more expensive, it may feel like buying a home is increasingly difficult.
Ministers will point to the help offered in the mini-budget, which means first-time buyers in England and Northern Ireland will only pay stamp duty on properties above £425,000, rather than £300,000, as well as discounts above that.
Savings rates are improving, and house price rises look set to stall or reverse, according to experts.
But, as is always the case, the security of your job and income, and how much you earn, will be key factors when judging what home you can afford.
Ethan Jones from Wolverhampton asks: ""What's the worst that can happen if I can't afford to pay my mortgage for say, three consecutive months?""
You are technically defined as being in arrears after missing two or more months of payments.
universal advice from debt charities here is to avoid putting your head in the sand.
If you are struggling, or know you will struggle, to make your monthly repayments, then you should contact your lender. Charities can also offer free, independent guidance.
Your lender is obliged to treat you fairly and consider any request to pay, for example, just part of the payment for a short period.
It is not allowed to repossess your home unless all reasonable attempts to resolve the situation have failed.
Kam Wan asks: ""Are my savings safe in a bank or building society?""
question that was asked a lot during the financial crisis over a decade ago, which was a very different scenario.
wer is yes. The Financial Services Compensation Scheme completely protects the first £85,000 saved per person, per financial institution if a bank or building society goes bust.
If you have more savings than that, experts suggest putting it into different accounts with different providers.
And, just to stress, there is no suggestion of a threat to the future of any banks or building societies right now.

technology	Technoblade: Minecraft YouTuber dies from cancer aged 23	"Minecraft YouTuber Technoblade has died aged 23, his family have confirmed in an emotional farewell video posted on his behalf.
, entitled ""so long nerds"" and posted to his 10 million followers, showed his father calling him ""the most amazing kid anyone could ever ask for"".
US internet personality rose to fame livestreaming and posting clips of himself playing the sandbox video game.
Last year, Technoblade revealed to fans he had been diagnosed with cancer.
farewell message, written hours before his death and read by his father, began: ""Hello everyone, Technoblade here. If you're watching this. I am dead.""
He went on to reveal that his real name was in fact Alex, reminiscing about the time he had pranked viewers into believing his name was Dave. 
""Thank you all for supporting my content over the years,"" he continued. ""If I had another hundred lives, I think I would choose to be Technoblade again every single time as those were the happiest years of my life.""
r, who won Minecraft tournaments and legions of fans talking about his life in a humorous way while playing the game, explained in a fundraising video posted in February that he had undergone chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a limb salvage operation after developing a painful tumour in his right arm.
He died from sarcoma, which is a rare bone and soft tissue cancer.
He disclosed his cancer diagnosis in August 2021, explaining that he initially thought the pain he was feeling was from a repetitive stress injury due to excessive gaming. After his arm became swollen he went to hospital and was subsequently diagnosed with cancer.
Little is known about Technoblade, who kept his true identity concealed until the end. But his online avatar was a picture of a crowned pig. 
He has 10.8 million subscribers to his YouTube channel, where he bio reads: ""I play video games too much. I might not be the best, but I do have hot elbows."" 
Following the news of his death, fans, fellow gamers and YouTubers paid tribute online.
""I'll never forget the day I met Technoblade,"" recalled J Schlatt. ""I left work early to play in a Minecraft tournament with him. I barely knew how to play... and the dude still carried us to win the entire event.
""Rest in peace, big guy. You'll always be a legend.""
YouTuber Captain Puffy aka Cara tweeted: ""Rest in peace Technoblade, He always treated me with pure kindness and never excluded me from anything. He couldn't of been a kinder person!""
She added: ""Thank you for everything you've done for this community, it will never be the same without you.""
mmy Innit said: ""Technoblade is a legend. From being a massive fan, to one of his actual friends, I can't describe how thankful I am to have been in his life. I just know he's strategizing in heaven on how to beat God...""
""I've been rewatching Technoblade's for the past hour,"" added Ludwig Ahgren. ""He was so witty and so humble even in the toughest of times. I'll always look up to him.""
Quackity expressed gratitude online too, posting: ""I had the opportunity to express to Technoblade how much admiration and respect I had for him, not only for the massive impact he had on all of us, but also for keeping his incredible humour even in the darkest moments. I will miss him so much.""
""May he rest in peace,""added eSports gamer Jake Lucky.
's father thanked fans in the farewell video, noting: ""You meant a lot to him.""
He explained that a portion of proceeds from online orders for his late son's merchandise would now go to charity.
with a written statement from his family, which read: ""We, the family of Technoblade, wanted all of you to know just how much he adored and respected his fans and colleagues.
""From Technoblade's earliest online days, he was always strategizing ways to delight and reward his audience - giving away online prizes, encouraging good sportsmanship, and most of all sharing his Minecraft adventures for entertainment and laughs.
""Even after his eventual successes he somehow managed to keep his good-natured humility, competing with an endearing balance between confidence and self-deprecating wit.""
Minecraft allows players to create their own experience in an imaginative virtual landscape, by digging holes to collect blocks.
Recent updates of the game have been used to help children explore and develop their career skills and knowledge, and to find solutions to real world problems such as flooding.
Nevison described Technoblade as being ""effortlessly funny"" and ""endlessly talented"". ""Gone too soon,"" he said.
Bad Boy Halo also paid tribute, adding: ""Words can't express how much you will be missed. The lives you've touched and the impact you've had on them will last forever.""
Slimecicle said Technoblade's ""personality and sense of humour were a true inspiration to me and countless others.""
""Thank you for everything you gave to a world that took you too soon, you will always be a legend."""	/news/entertainment-arts-62006852
politics	Tory leadership: Hopefuls jostle for MPs' support	"Conservative MPs hoping to succeed Liz Truss as prime minister are racing to find backers before a Monday deadline.
Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has ruled himself out of the contest, adding he is ""leaning towards"" backing Boris Johnson.
former PM has not ruled out a dramatic comeback, months after being forced out after a Tory revolt.
Candidates to replace Ms Truss need support from at least 100 colleagues, limiting the contest to three.
She resigned on Thursday just six weeks into the job, making her tumultuous premiership the shortest in British history.
Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt, who stood unsuccessfully in the contest to replace Mr Johnson, are also seen as likely contenders to run again.
So far, the BBC estimates that Mr Sunak has the most MPs declaring their support, with 63, compared to 38 for Mr Johnson and 17 for Ms Mordaunt.
But in a fast-moving situation, former Home Secretary Suella Braverman and International Trade Secretary Kemi Badenoch are thought to be considering bids.
Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has ruled himself out, along with Security Minister Tom Tugendhat and former cabinet minister Michael Gove. 
Candidates have until 2pm on Monday to find 100 backers. If three reach the threshold, MPs will knock out one contender in a ballot on the same day.
MPs will hold an ""indicative"" ballot of the final two, with the winner then decided in an online vote of party members to finish on Friday next week.
Mr Wallace said he was ""leaning towards"" supporting Mr Johnson, although he added the former PM still had ""questions to answer"" over the investigation he faces into his Partygate conduct.
He told reporters Mr Johnson had a ""mandate"" from the 2019 general election and ""could win the next election"".
But Tory MP Jesse Norman, one of scores of ministers to quit Mr Johnson's government, said bringing him back would be an ""absolutely catastrophic decision"".
Business Secretary Jacob Rees-Mogg has been encouraging MP colleagues to nominate Mr Johnson, and tweeted his support earlier alongside the hashtag ""Boris or bust"".
Fellow Conservative MP Tim Loughton took issue with the rallying cry, suggesting it would damage party unity.
He tweeted in reply: ""How on earth can that slogan be remotely helpful to the party given the strong possibility that the next PM will not be Boris?""
If Mr Johnson did make a comeback it would be unprecedented in British political history, coming three months after being forced out by his own MPs after a string of scandals.
Polling suggests he remains popular with Tory members, but another tilt at the leadership could prove divisive among Tory MPs, some of whom have said they would quit politics if he came back.
WATCH: Liz Truss's 45 days in office
Opposition parties are calling for a general election to decide who should be the next prime minister. 
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said if Mr Johnson returned to No 10, that would be the ""most powerful argument"" for another poll.
""I remind myself that only three months ago Boris Johnson left office because most of those who were serving him on his front bench had declared that he was unfit for office,"" he said.
xt general election is not due to take place until at least 2024 and, at this stage, it looks unlikely that date will be brought forward.
Labour has been way ahead of the Conservatives in recent opinion polls. 
Ms Truss's resignation on Thursday followed weeks of turmoil on financial markets following her tax-cutting mini-budget in September. 
In response, she sacked her Chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, and appointed Jeremy Hunt to the post hours later to try to calm the markets. 
On Wednesday, her Home Secretary, Suella Braverman, resigned and a chaotic night with accusations of bullying during a vote in the House of Commons followed, sealing her fate."	/news/uk-politics-63338171

f four days already announced for late November, around the Black Friday shopping weekend.
Communication Workers Union (CWU) said ""the livelihoods of postal workers"" were at stake.
Royal Mail said changes to the business were ""not optional"".
g-running dispute revolves around pay, jobs and conditions at the privately-owned firm.
w strikes have been called for 9, 11, 14, 15, 23 and 24 December, the busiest time of the year for deliveries.
CWU which represents more than 115,000 postal workers at Royal Mail, said it still wanted a negotiated settlement with Royal Mail Group and would ""continue to engage the company to that end"".
""But those in charge of Royal Mail need to wake up and realise we won't allow them to destroy the livelihoods of postal workers,"" it said.
Last month Royal Mail proposed a ""pay-for-change"" offer which would include changes to workers' shift patterns including start times and Sunday working in exchange for a 9% pay rise spread over two years.
CWU rejected the offer describing the company's plans as the ""Uberisation"" of the postal service.
Royal Mail said:  ""Our preference is for an agreement with the CWU but the change we need is not optional.
""They should be focused on a resolution to this dispute for their members and the long-term health of the business, rather than damaging strike action,"" it said."	/news/business-63671301
technology	Northampton inventor's Microsoft trademark dispute 'resolved'	"A dispute with Microsoft over the name of a device to help child literacy has been resolved by dropping an ""s"", its inventor said.
Kate McKenzie, from Duston, Northampton, created a tool called Word Windows, which will now be known as Word Window.
She said Microsoft had opposed her trademark but she could now launch the product with the new name.
She said she would be ""getting on with what we wanted to do from the start"".

""The premise is you can put on top of the book your child is reading so you can reduce it so you can read with whatever bit of the word they are struggling with,"" Mrs McKenzie said.
She said she created the device as she struggled with reading at school due to dyslexia and her son was facing similar issues.
Nine days before the product was due to go to market, on 1 July, she received a letter from lawyers representing Microsoft.
But she told BBC Radio Northampton: ""Everything is now resolved, the packaging has been reprinted, all the bits and pieces have been changed in terms of the website.""
Mrs McKenzie said although the name has slightly changed ""the product is the same"".
She will be launching the invention at Northamptonshire Central Library, in Northampton, on Saturday, which she was ""feeling a little bit nervous about"".
Mrs McKenzie said: ""One of the aspects of my dyslexia is I can find myself stumbling and stuttering over words.
""But the actual chance to launch the business to get started and to start to help parents and the children is very exciting.""
Microsoft previously said to the BBC that it ""cannot comment on ongoing legal matters"".

health	Ambulance handover delays: Hospitals blame 'delayed discharges'	"One in five ambulance patients in England waited more than an hour to be handed to A&E teams during the week leading up to Christmas.
Among trusts which had more than 500 ambulance arrivals, the highest proportion of patients waiting over an hour was 54% at University Hospitals Bristol & Weston.
was followed by Gloucestershire Hospitals at 53%.
NHS England said hospitals are being ""impacted by delayed discharges"".
figure is down from nearly one in four the previous week, partly due to industrial action by ambulance workers on 21 December.
On the day of the strike, the proportion of patients waiting over an hour was 14% compared with an average across the week of 20%.
However the figures are well above the 4% for the equivalent week last year and 3% in 2020.
A total of 37% of handovers last week were delayed by at least 30 minutes, down from 41% the previous week but higher than the 13% recorded at this point in 2021 and 11% in 2020.
NHS trusts have a target of 95% of all ambulance handovers to be completed within 30 minutes, with 100% within 60 minutes.
Following Bristol & Weston and Gloucestershire in the proportion of patients waiting over an hour, were University Hospitals of North Midlands at 50% (307 of 619), Mid & South Essex at 46% (406 of 887), North Bristol at 44% (237 of 538) and Shrewsbury & Telford also at 44% (224 of 512).
NHS England said hospital capacities were being affected by delayed discharging of patients, with 12,313 beds a day taken up by patients who were ready to leave.
""Staff pulled out all the stops to ensure as many patients as possible were able to spend Christmas with loved ones at home,"" a spokesperson said, adding that the figure for delayed discharges was the lowest since August.
Hospitals are also facing pressure from a rise in winter viruses and patients testing positive for Covid-19.
Professor Mark Pietroni, director of safety and medical director at Gloucestershire Hospitals, said they were working to address the issues and had made some ""very significant improvements"" in reducing handover times.
""The health and care system in Gloucestershire remains under considerable pressure. This situation has been compounded by staffing challenges, resulting in unusually long waits relative to recent weeks. 
""It is important to stress that all patients arriving by ambulance and waiting to come into our emergency departments are assessed to ensure they are given the correct level of priority,"" he added.
University Hospitals Bristol & Weston has been approached for comment.
Meanwhile, health leaders in Bath and North East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire have said that delays in discharging patients is contributing to ""unprecedented demand"" on services.
re system is under ""intense pressure"" with record numbers in A&E. 
Chief nurse, Gill May, said: ""We are appealing to local people to help us get loved ones home from hospital, using the right health and care service when looking for support, practicing effective self-care, visiting pharmacies for help with minor ailments and following advice from NHS 111.""
Dr Jon Westbrook, chief medical officer at Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, added: ""We are asking the public to do all they can to support us at this extremely busy time.""

politics	Liz Truss resignation: World politicians and media react to Truss departure	"News of Liz Truss's resignation on Thursday has generated significant reaction from the world's political leaders and media commentators.
Many editorials focus on Ms Truss's brief and chaotic time in office - while others speculate on what her departure means for British foreign and trade policies.
Among foreign politicians, France's President Emmanuel Macron said that on a personal level, he was always ""sad to see a colleague go"", but that the most important thing was for Britain to find stability.
White House reporters asked US President Joe Biden whether Ms Truss had made the right decision. He replied it was her decision to make, adding that he wouldn't ""weigh in on her judgement"".
In an earlier statement, Mr Biden said close relations with the UK would continue, and thanked Ms Truss for her partnership on issues including ""holding Russia accountable for its war against Ukraine"". 
Dymtro Kuleba, the foreign minister of Ukraine, said Ms Truss's exit had been dramatic, but voiced his confidence that British support for Kyiv would not drop.
Ukrainian government was reported in the British press to have tweeted - and then deleted - a post reading ""better call Boris"", in an apparent endorsement of any bid by the former PM to win back Tory leadership.
re was little sympathy for Ms Truss from Russia. Its foreign ministry spokeswoman said the UK had ""never known such a disgrace of a prime minister"". 
Other nations questioned what the news would mean for post-Brexit trading arrangements that had been under discussion with Ms Truss, a former international trade secretary.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he was ""concerned"" that the turmoil could scupper a deal between the two nations which had been finalised, though not yet ratified.
Calling attention to the UK's rapidly changing leadership, he said: ""I've been in office for five months. I've met the two British prime ministers, so far, and I obviously will have contact with a third.""
And there are similar concerns in India. ""Truss's exit catapults the India-UK free trade deal in a zone of uncertainty"", writes India's NDTV, quoting an Indian commerce minister as saying he would ""wait and see"" what happened next. 
Daily Star's longevity competition between Ms Truss and a lettuce appears to have cut through to international audiences: ""Her agenda had floundered, her own party had turned on her and commentators widely speculated on whether she could outlast a head of lettuce. She couldn't,"" wrote the New York Times. 
Even the Russian politician Dmitry Medvedev - a close ally of President Vladimir Putin - referenced the feature, bidding a sarcastic farewell to Ms Truss on Twitter, saying: ""Bye, bye @trussliz, congrats to lettuce.""
Washington Post summed up the prime minister's end: ""A disastrous series of self-inflicted wounds - which turned into a political death spiral - began with a misfired attempt by the Conservative leader to radically reorient the government's economic agenda by slashing taxes without saying how the move would be paid for. The markets responded badly, and Truss never recovered.""
Canada's Globe and Mail wrote: ""On Wednesday, she lost the second of the government's four most senior ministers, faced laughter as she tried to defend her record to parliament and saw her lawmakers openly quarrel over policy, deepening the sense of chaos at Westminster.""
Chinese commentators took aim at the six-week prime minister. The China News Service said Ms Truss had proved to be not an Iron Lady, but a paper one - a reference to former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The prominent former editor of the Global Times said Ms Truss had been ""insolent and unreasonable"" with her tough stance towards Beijing.
Sydney Morning Herald was scathing, saying ""the debacle highlights a worrying trend evident in many Western democracies - the rise of politicians ill-prepared and ill-suited to high office"".
Nigeria's Premium Times said Ms Truss's botched mini-budget had caused ""financial turmoil"". And the London correspondent of Brazil's GloboNews described the situation in the UK as ""utter turbulence, chaos on all fronts, a government in intensive care"", while in Argentina, La Nación told of a ""crisis in Great Britain"".
In Europe, The Irish Times pulled no punches in describing ""a low moment in the history of British politics"".
""Whatever emerges in the next week, the mother of parliaments has been reduced to a bad joke, its constitution a laughing stock,"" it said, later adding: ""A prime minister is normally supposed to stand for something. Truss in Downing Street today stood for nothing.""
Meanwhile, Irish leader Micheál Martin called for stability in the UK, saying: ""We would like to see the UK system… to be in a position to have a successor selected as quickly as possible.""
France's Le Figaro described Liz Truss's ""descent into hell"". It wrote: ""She will go down as the most short-lived prime minister in contemporary history, with just 44 days in office during which she deepened the economic hardship of millions of Britons, weakened her country's image internationally and depleted what was left of unity in a conservative party weakened after 12 years in power.""
Spanish newspaper El Pais was particularly blunt. ""She had become a prime minister devoid of content, without a program to defend, incapable of effectively communicating the work of the government and completely at odds with her parliamentary group.""
""The fiasco of Wednesday's vote on a booby-trapped motion by the Labour opposition made matters worse. Shaking, shoving and shouting among Tory MPs , forced to vote against their will on an issue as controversial as fracking to show their loyalty to a government that was falling apart minute by minute.""
Commentators in Italy playfully compared the situation to repeat changes of government in their own country. ""Great Britain seems to have fallen into a political instability worthy of the Roman theatre that we know well,"" read an editorial in Corriere Della Sera.
In Germany, tabloid Bild described the situation as a ""Brit-quake"", adding that the ""head of lettuce is having a big party now"", in another reference to the Daily Star.
Gustavo Petro, Colombia's outspoken and first-ever left-wing president, suggested that Ms Truss's demise was sparked by attempts to reduce taxes on the richest, adding that it was a lesson to leaders around the world.
Meanwhile, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte was another world leader to call for stability and a quick resolution to the leadership contest. 
""Personally I was very happy with the way we were working together,"" he said of Ms Truss.
In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he thought Ms Truss had taken an ""old-fashioned"" approach to the economic crisis in lowering taxes and cutting welfare policies.

health	Diphtheria cases rising among asylum seekers	"umber of cases of diphtheria among asylum seekers who have recently arrived in the UK has risen to more than 50, the BBC understands. 
It comes after it was confirmed that one migrant who died after being held at Manston processing centre in Kent had contracted the disease.
man died in hospital on 19 November after entering the UK on a small boat seven days earlier.
Home Office said it takes the welfare of those in its care seriously. 
week, health officials are set to confirm there have been more than 50 diphtheria cases among asylum seekers this year, the BBC understands. 
In 2021, there were three of the same strain, according to government data.
Diphtheria is a highly contagious infection that affects the nose, throat and sometimes cause ulcers on the skin. 
According to the NHS website, it's spread by coughs and sneezes or through close contact with someone who is infected, and in serious cases can be fatal.
You can also get it by sharing items such as cups, cutlery, clothing or bedding with an infected person.
Babies and children in the UK are vaccinated against diphtheria, meaning cases are rare. However, the infection is potentially dangerous to migrants who come from countries where this is not the case.
UK Health Security Agency (HSA) says it is not known if the more than 50 people who have or have had diphtheria were infected at Manston. 
rising amongst asylum seekers across Europe and some people reported symptoms before arriving, and so could have been infected in their home country. 
However, the incubation period for the illness is between two and five days, with a maximum of 10 days, so infections in people who were at Manston are likely to be recent. 
A post-mortem examination is trying to determine whether the man held at Manston died because of his diphtheria infection. 
According to a Home Office spokesperson, hospital tests indicate ""diphtheria may be the cause of the illness"".
Initial tests were negative and the Home Office said at the time there was ""no evidence at this stage"" that the person had died from an infectious disease. But a follow-up PCR test for diphtheria has since produced a positive result. 
Health officials have advised vaccines and antibiotics are offered to people on arrival at their new accommodation, and close contacts are identified.
Manston centre was cleared of people earlier this month after reports of overcrowding and outbreaks of disease. There are concerns that people who may have had diphtheria have been moved around the country.
Sunday Times reports that Jim McManus, president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, said this ""had put asylum seekers and potentially hotel workers at avoidable and preventable risk"" and had ""created additional and preventable burdens on local health system"".
He also accused the Home Office of a ""lack of co-ordination"" that has ""made the situation far worse than it could be"".
Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat health spokesperson Daisy Cooper said the government should be ""ashamed"" of what she called ""callous complacency over the health and well-being of asylum seekers"".
A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We work closely with a range of partners within the community including local authorities and health leads to make sure information is shared in a timely way and that everyone leaving Manston is given access to appropriate treatment.
""As the UK Health Security Agency have made clear, the risk of diphtheria to the public is very low, due to high uptake of the diphtheria vaccine in this country and because the infection is typically passed on through close prolonged contact with a case. 
""We take both the welfare of those in our care and our wider public health responsibilities extremely seriously. As such, we continue to work closely with the NHS and UKHSA to support the individuals affected and limit the transmission of infection."" 
Manston migrant processing facility is a former military base and is designed to hold just 1,600 people. But in October there were around 4,000 migrants being held there. 
More than 40,000 migrants have crossed the Channel on small boats this year.
Home Secretary Suella Braverman told the Home Affairs Select Committee that the government had ""failed to control our borders"". She also blamed migrants and people smugglers for the chaos at Manston."	/news/uk-63771091
sports	Nekoda Smythe-Davis on concussion, pregnancy and the mother of all comebacks	"""I didn't know if I'd make it back,"" admits Nekoda Smythe-Davis as a smile breaks across her face. ""After a concussion and having my baby girl, I just wasn't sure, but I don't feel I'm special. I'm just a hard worker.""
Smythe-Davis is proud, but humble, as she reflects on a gold medal-winning performance at the Riccione European Open - just her second international competition after an absence of nearly three years.
As she begins to reveal exactly what her journey has entailed, and the anxiety-driven ""dark times"" she endured, the extent of her modesty becomes even more apparent.
Smythe-Davis first shot to prominence at Glasgow 2014 by claiming -57kg Commonwealth Games gold, but it was her World Championship podium places - bronze in 2017, and silver a year later - which marked her out as a potential Olympic star come Tokyo 2020.
, though, brought a new level of attention - and pressure. 
""It was hard because people are not just hoping that I'll go and do my best - they're seeing my second Olympic Games as an opportunity to win a medal,"" she recalls.  
""That's what they wanted, that's what I wanted, and that's why British Judo and UK Sport put so much money into me.""
A multiple Grand Slam medallist, Smythe-Davis had confidence in her ability to match those targets, but in late 2019 her world changed after taking a ""bad knock"" in training. 
Concussions vary in severity, and although awareness of their long-term impact is improving, treatment is still largely in its infancy.
Smythe-Davis had access to leading medical professionals including neurologists, but it was near impossible for them to predict how long recovery could, or should, take.
""Anyone who's been through long post-concussion syndrome will know how important treatment is for recovery and I had a whiplash with it as well, so there were a lot of issues with my neck and spine,"" she says.
""The pandemic meant [rehabilitation] ground to a halt and just completely sent me into regression.
""I had a two-to-three-month period where things were really bad with migraines and then there were days where genuinely an accomplishment would be getting up and having a shower or taking the dog for a walk.""
As the Covid pandemic restrictions eased and training opportunities - as well as full medical support - returned, Smythe-Davis made tentative steps towards a return.
She still retained the dream of competing at the 2020 Olympics, which had been postponed by 12 months, but in January 2021 the judoka ""reluctantly"" came to the conclusion she needed to take time away to ensure a full recovery.
""I was in a really dark place and there was a lot of turmoil because I was scared to make the decision and didn't want to let anyone down,"" Smythe-Davis admits. ""But at the end of the day, no-one was going to be as disappointed as myself.""
In August of that year, her life changed forever and ""for the better"" as she became a mother for the first time with the arrival of daughter Ryia.
""I'm very strategic in the way I've always viewed my sporting goals and when would be the right time to become a mother,"" she says.
""I had a plan for after the Tokyo Olympics and making that decision at the time about not to push on after the concussion, that opened the door for me. I'm very fortunate that it happened quite quickly, I had a really health pregnancy and birth of my baby was good.
""It just gave me something else to focus on and she brings a whole new energy to our lives really, and to be honest I don't think I'd want to continue in my sporting journey without her.
""The fact I have her now is almost what spurs me on."" 
Just over a year after giving birth, the Rio Olympian made her competitive international return with a fifth-place finish in an unfamiliar -63kg division at the Oberwart European Open in early September.  
A week later she went on to claim gold - in her traditional -57kg category - in Italy.
29-year-old did not compete at the World Championships earlier this month as she takes ""baby steps"" in her comeback, but will next target the Abu Dhabi Grand Slam on 21 October.  
""Although [taking so long out] wasn't my initial plan, it was the plan that needed to happen to ensure my longevity in the sport and also my happiness,"" says Smythe-Davis.
""I'm trying to now look forward to the Paris Olympics in 2024, but to look back at where I was to where I am now, I'm really proud with my journey and myself."""	/sport/judo/63300639
entertainment	Queen premiere previously unheard Freddie Mercury song Face It Alone	"Queen have revealed a previously unheard, deeply emotional song they recorded with Freddie Mercury in 1988.
Face It Alone, which the late singer recorded during sessions for 1989 album The Miracle, was given its premiere by BBC Radio 2's Ken Bruce on Thursday.
""We did find a little gem from Freddie, that we'd kind of forgotten about,"" drummer Roger Taylor said about the track in June.
""It's wonderful, a real discovery. It's a very passionate piece.""
g is one of six unreleased tracks to feature in a forthcoming box set of The Miracle, four of which feature Mercury's vocals.
A slow, sombre ballad, Face It Alone opens with a pounding drum and a finger-picked guitar line, before Mercury sings: ""When something so near and dear to life / Explodes inside / You feel your soul is set on fire.""
It was recorded during the historic sessions for The Miracle in London and Switzerland, when Mercury had been diagnosed with HIV but hadn't made it public.
In a powerful vocal, he appears to reference his failing health, growing increasingly passionate as he repeats the refrain: ""In the end / You have to face it all alone.""
Guitarist Brian May originally thought the recording was unsalvageable, but engineers proved him wrong. 
""It was kind of hiding in plain sight,"" he told Radio 2's Zoe Ball earlier this year. 
""We looked at it many times and thought, oh no, we can't really rescue that. But in fact, we went in there again and our wonderful engineering team went, 'OK, we can do this and this.' 
""It's like kind of stitching bits together... but it's beautiful, it's touching.""
One of more than 20 off-cuts from the sessions, Face It Alone is much darker than tracks like I Want It All and The Invisible Man, which eventually made it on to The Miracle.
um's closing track Was It All Worth It, however, dealt with similar themes, as the star reflected on his life and career and asked: ""Am I a happy man / Or is this sinking sand?""

World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert over four of Maiden's cough syrups linked to the deaths of almost 70 children.
Investigations are currently under way in India and The Gambia.
Regulators said that they had suspended all manufacturing activities at the New Delhi-based firm after finding it had broken a number of safety rules.
was ""in view of the seriousness of the contraventions observed during the investigation and its potential risk to the quality, safety and efficacy of the drug being produced,"" they added.
Maiden did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.
Last week, the company said it was ""shocked to hear media reports regarding the deaths and deeply saddened by this incident"".
me after the WHO issued a global alert over four of Maiden's cough syrups, warning that they could be linked to acute kidney injuries and the children's deaths in July, August and September.
global health organisation also warned the products ""may have been distributed, through informal markets, to other countries and regions"" besides The Gambia.
medicines were identified as Promethazine Oral Solution, Kofexmalin Baby Cough Syrup, Makoff Baby Cough Syrup and Magrip N Cold Syrup.

politics	Industries join call for Scottish solar power reforms	"Companies from a range of sectors have backed calls from the solar industry for urgent changes to Scottish planning law and tax rules.
More than 20 firms and trade bodies have written to ministers arguing that business rates and permitted development rights must be reformed.
A joint letter states that businesses are currently ""unable to deploy solar energy at the necessary speed"".
It argues changes would help firms cut energy costs and decarbonise.
gnatories include representatives from agriculture, warehousing, distilling, food and solar.
r calls on the Scottish government to allow the installation of solar panels with up to 5MW capacity without having to seek planning permission. The current ""permitted development"" threshold is 50kW.
It states: ""This limit artificially constrains the potential for commercial rooftop solar. 
""The space of a roof will automatically constrain the maximum size of a solar power project, which in any case will be subject to all other relevant planning requirements.""
r, which was drawn up by trade body Solar Energy Scotland, also calls on ministers to exempt firms from paying non-domestic rates on new solar panels on a 12-year rolling basis, as is the case in England.
""Business owners who install solar should not pay a premium for decarbonising their business,"" it says. 
""The Scottish government risks its own ambitious climate mitigation goals by effectively penalising Scottish businesses who wish to install affordable, reliable and renewable onsite energy."" 
gnatories include Aberdeenshire-based shortbread maker Dean's.
Managing director Bill Dean said: ""We have put off investing on solar PV panels for more than six years, entirely because the business rating system penalises businesses for trying to help themselves control their energy cost.
""If this matter had been addressed years ago, businesses would more than likely have invested in fully covering their roofs with solar panels and would have been in a much better position to face the energy price crisis.""
Other signatories include Black Isle Brewery, Browns Food Group, Uddingston-based Emtec Group, animal feed firm Harbro, Edinburgh-based The Scottish Salmon Company, the Scottish Timber Trade Association, the Federation of Small Businesses and the UK Warehousing Association.
Solar Energy Scotland chairman Thomas McMillan said: ""Solar energy is now the cheapest energy source available to Scottish businesses, and can be deployed rapidly, improving our energy security and reducing our carbon emissions. 
""Given we face growing climate breakdown, geopolitical instability and sharply rising costs, I hope these simple changes can be delivered before the end of the year.""
Scottish government said it provided non-domestic rates relief for small-scale solar energy producers and supported microgeneration producers and businesses that retrofitted micro-renewable schemes to meet part of their energy needs. 
A spokesman said: ""We will continue to consider how this support can develop. 
""Decisions on any non-domestic rates policies will be set out in the Scottish budget alongside other government priorities in light of affordability.""
He added: ""We have been working closely with industry in recent months on developing the solar vision which will be published in our Energy Strategy and Just Transition Plan later this year and provide the certainty needed for investment in our energy transition.
""We are also bringing forward our consideration of permitted development rights for domestic and non-domestic renewable energy equipment, including non-domestic solar panels, and intend to consult on this in early 2023."""	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-63541500

health	Surge in Strep A cases reported across Scotland	"Health officials have recorded more than 430 cases of Strep A in Scotland in two weeks.
Strep A infections are usually mild, causing illness ranging from a sore throat to scarlet fever, but can develop into a more serious invasive Group A Strep (iGAS) infection.
Jim McMenamin, of Public Health Scotland (PHS), said the numbers were similar to the last surge in 2017/18.
But despite six deaths across the UK no children have died in Scotland.
UK Health Security Agency said the rise in Strep A cases is most likely due to high amounts of the bacteria circulating and increased social mixing.
Parents are being urged to look out for symptoms and to promptly contact their GP or NHS24 if they have any concerns.
Dr McMenamin told BBC Reporting Scotland there had been an increase in the seasonal expected numbers of Group A Strep (GAS) infections.
miologist said: ""Over the last couple of weeks we have respectively seen 207 and 230 cases, which is very similar to what we have seen reported in the 2017/18 season but just an awful lot earlier than we might have seen in the past.""
In very rare occasions the bacteria can get into the bloodstream and cause an iGAS infection.
PHS has received report of eight such cases in children under the age of 10 since September.
Dr Jim McMenamin, of Public Health Scotland, details some of the symptoms associated with Strep A infections
Dr McMenamin, head of health protection (infection services) at PHS, said Covid restrictions over the past two years meant many children had not encountered the streptococcal infections that are now beginning to be reported.
Among the symptoms that can develop is a rough rash which is pink in colour.
He said other things for parents to look our for is their child going off food or becoming irritable.
Dr McMenamin highlighted the importance of early diagnosis as antibiotics were ""very effective"" and usually had a positive impact within 24 hours.
But he added some patients would require hospital treatment.
Health officials confirmed on Friday that six children had died with iGAS - including five under 10-year-olds in England and a girl from Wales since September. 
No deaths have been confirmed in Scotland or Northern Ireland.
UK Health Security Agency said the last time there was an intensive period of Strep A infection in 2017-18 there were four deaths in England in the equivalent time frame.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday, infectious diseases paediatrician Prof Beate Kampmann said there had been three times as much scarlet fever this year than was seen pre-pandemic: 
Prof Kampmann said: ""It starts off with a high fever, very sore throat and very red tongue, which has this sort of papillae - eventually developing a rash which feels a bit like sandpaper.
""The rash starts in the elbows and behind the neck. It tends to then peel after about ten days because the disease is caused by a toxin that is produced by this bacterium.""
She said children with a fever should be kept off school and added Group A Strep was ""very, very treatable"" with penicillin.
Virologist Dr Chris Smith said the general rise in Strep A infections could be due to a drop in immunity following the pandemic. 
He told BBC Breakfast: ""There's something about the vulnerability of the population and particularly younger people. 
""What has changed is that younger people have been through three years, almost, of relative isolation from each other. 
""They haven't caught the normal infections at the normal rates and at the normal times that normal children of that sort of age bracket would have done. 
""So, we wonder whether it is that we are seeing a big rash of cases all at once.""

Matlock Canoe Club, based at Matlock Bath, were left ""heartbroken"" by the theft.   
Club secretary Donna Hawkins said that beginner equipment was taken during the afternoon of 5 July.
Offenders used an angle grinder to cut locks before taking items with a high resale value, she added.
Ms Hawkins said the break-in took place between 12:00 and 16:00 BST, just after a course had finished, leading her to believe that they may have been watched ""for weeks"" by the thieves.  
""We were using 10 boats in the course, and they were the ones that were taken - they left three others,"" she said. 
She said the club had recently started its first beginner course in three years after recovering from a spate of floods. 
In November 2019, their slalom gates were swept away and floodlights were ruined by high water levels. 
r recovery was hampered by Covid-19, but progress was made until more flooding hit in February 2022. 
""We're just getting back on our feet and now this has happened. We're heartbroken,"" Ms Hawkins said

politics	Suella Braverman was in denial over forced resignation, sources say	"Suella Braverman was ""amazed"" and ""in denial"" over being forced to resign for breaching the ministerial code, according to sources. 
Ms Braverman stood down as then PM Liz Truss's home secretary on 19 October after admitting to a ""technical infringement"" by sending an official document from a personal email account. 
A number of sources have disputed Ms Braverman's version of events. 
Rishi Sunak is facing questions over reappointing her six days later.
w prime minister defended his decision to make Ms Braverman his home secretary, saying ""she made an error of judgment, but she recognised that, she raised the matter and she accepted her mistake"".
BBC has spoken to several people with knowledge of the events surrounding Ms Braverman's resignation. 
A number of them dispute Ms Braverman's claim to have reported her mistake to the cabinet secretary - the head of the civil service - as soon as she realised.  
When confronted about her transgression she attempted to play down and explain away what had happened, sources suggested.
Ms Braverman had emailed a draft written ministerial statement on immigration policy to her close political ally, Conservative MP Sir John Hayes, using her personal email instead of her official government account.  
ument made reference to plans to ""make changes to the visa system to support economic growth"" and to ""ensure our visa system supports priority growth projects"" and ""extending the high potential individual visa route"", the BBC understands.
Ms Braverman had intended to copy in Sir John Hayes's wife, who works in his office. But she chose the wrong recipient and instead sent it to a staff member of another Conservative MP, Andrew Percy, early in the morning of 19 October. 
When Mr Percy became aware of what had happened, he approached the chief whip, who is responsible for party discipline. The chief whip in turn passed the issue on to Number 10 and the Cabinet Office. 
It's understood Mr Percy's office also made Ms Braverman aware of the error shortly after the mistaken email was received. 
Cabinet Secretary Simon Case advised then prime minister Ms Truss that ""it was an open and shut case of the ministerial code being breached"", according to one government insider. He had not by then been approached by the home secretary herself, according to sources.
Sir Keir advises Rishi Sunak: ""He should sack her - that would be the strong thing to do. That's what I would do if I was PM.""
Downing Street has insisted it won't comment on the ""timeline"" of events. 
One source told me ""initially [Ms Braverman] was in a state of denial"" when Ms Truss made it clear that afternoon she would have to resign. 
""She was saying it was a minor thing,"" the same source added.
Another said Ms Braverman was ""amazed"" that Ms Truss took the view she did. 
A source close to the home secretary said any suggestion she was confronted by the cabinet secretary with evidence of the breach was false, adding: ""In advance of the meeting with the prime minister, she had communicated it proactively via official channels, to the cabinet secretary.""
Instead of waiting for the resignation to be choreographed by Number 10, Ms Braverman published her resignation letter on Twitter last Wednesday evening. 
In the letter, Ms Braverman said she had ""serious concerns"" about Ms Truss's government's commitment to reducing migration numbers.
Labour is calling on Mr Sunak to sack Ms Braverman, claiming that she poses a potential security risk.
rty is also demanding ""urgent reassurances"" that the leaked email did not contain ""market sensitive information""."	/news/uk-politics-63433252
business	Ted Baker set for £211m takeover by Reebok's owner	"Baker, the UK fashion retailer, has agreed to a takeover by the US company that owns Reebok, Juicy Couture and the image rights to Elvis Presley. 
Authentic Brands Group has offered to buy Ted Baker for £211m, ending months of speculation over the firm's fate.
Baker, which has just under 400 stores and concessions around the world, put itself up for sale in April.
It follows a difficult few years for the company, though it recently reported its losses had narrowed.
In 2019, Ted Baker's founder Ray Kelvin - who had been chief executive since the company's launch in 1987 - resigned over claims he presided over a culture of ""forced hugging"".
He has denied all allegations of misconduct. In 2020, the company was found to have overstated the value of its stock by £58m.
Like other high street retailers, Ted Baker was forced to temporarily close its doors during the coronavirus lockdowns, but it is attempting a turnaround as demand for office wear and clothing for social events returns.
Sales for the year to 29 January jumped by more than 20% to £428.2m. Pre-tax losses shrank from to £44.1m from £107.7m in the year before. 
Baker saw its share price jump by 17% to 109p after it confirmed the offer from Authentic Brands.
Baker's interim chairwoman Helena Feltham said the board believed Authentic Brands's offer of 110p per share ""balances the company's growth prospects with the risks of the uncertain economic environment in which the business is operating"".
Authentic Brands is headquartered in New York and manages a large range of brands such as Juicy Couture, famed for its velour tracksuits, sportswear brand Reebok as well as cultural icons such as Elvis and Marilyn Monroe. 
It also has a partnership with David Beckham where it co-owns and manages the former England footballer's ""global brand"".
Authentic Brands said it ""believes Ted Baker is a distinctive British lifestyle brand with a rich, authentic heritage and strong worldwide customer recognition"" and it ""will be a good custodian"" of the name. 
keover of a UK company by a US firm was announced as another British business became the target of an overseas buyer.

entertainment	Mouth painting inspired by rugby star Doddie Weir	"An artist who paints with his mouth after being left paralysed has created artwork to raise funds for the charity set up by Scots rugby star Doddie Weir.
Henry Fraser, who is paralysed from the neck down, was inspired by the rugby legend who has motor neurone disease.
He said his take on the ""Doddie 5 Tartan"" embodied what it meant to ""turn life's hardships on their head"".
Mr Fraser hopes the funds raised from his designs help to change the lives of those suffering with the disease.
30-year-old artist played rugby from a young age until he was 17 when he suffered life-changing injuries from a diving accident in Portugal in 2009.
His love of art, which he had throughout his childhood, was rekindled in 2015 after he learned to paint with his mouth.
Doddie Weir, a former Scotland international rugby star, was diagnosed with MND in 2016, which led him to set up the My Name'5 Doddie foundation.
His positive outlook and upbeat nature made him a ""huge inspiration"" to Mr Fraser.
He said: ""Like Doddie, I was an active man prior to my accident. Having that taken away so suddenly was completely life-changing.
""It forced me to re-evaluate and recalibrate absolutely everything and meant transforming my physical strength into mental strength.
""Although we are going through two very different things, I really look up to him as a role model,"" he said.
Mr Fraser has hundreds of designs, from famous sportspeople to exotic animals and landscapes.
His prints of the tartan can be bought online, with all proceeds going directly to the My Name'5 Doddie Foundation.
""The painting isn't intended to be perfect,"" said Mr Fraser.
""This painting is a reflection of two people who have battled something life-changing. I think the piece brings our experiences together.
""If I can change just one person's life through the funds we raise with these digital prints, then I'll know it's a job well done.""
Jill Douglas, chief executive of the My Name'5 Doddie Foundation, said it was because of people like Henry that the organisation could ""research into MND and try to give people living with this terrible disease some hope."""	/news/uk-scotland-63241014

technology	Anti-drone laser weapon hub to be created in Scotland	"A European hub for high-energy laser weaponry is to be based in Livingston, Scotland, a big defence firm has said.
Raytheon UK said the ""advanced laser integration centre"" would open next year and would help meet growing demand for laser weapons designed to destroy small attack drones.
firm said the war in Ukraine had highlighted the threat they posed.
re will focus on the testing, fielding and maintenance of defensive high-energy laser (HEL) weapons.
Raytheon's anti-drone lasers are small enough to be fitted to military vehicles.
Last year, Raytheon was awarded a demonstrator contract to provide a high-energy laser weapon system to the UK Ministry of Defence, to be installed on the UK Wolfhound land vehicle, the company said.
It claims that ""demand is spiking for cost-effective lasers"" able to defeat ""asymmetric"" threats from drones, rockets and mortars.
Small commercial drones, which the weapons are designed to defend against, have demonstrated their military effectiveness in Ukraine, directing and correcting artillery fire and, in some cases, being modified to carry explosives.
Speaking from the Farnborough Airshow, Annabel Flores, Raytheon's president of electronic warfare systems, told the BBC some of the additional interest and demand for the technology was as a result of how drones had been used in the conflict.
""The thought is coming into how do you defend against them effectively, making our ongoing conversations with customers much deeper and much more pronounced,""  she said.
HEL weapons had advantages she added, particularly the cost per shot.
While military ordnance can be very expensive, drones and quadcopters are in the £84 range, she said.
Once connected to a power supply, she said, the system could keep running.
However, the weapons do not resemble the lasers of popular sci-fi, as their drone-destroying beams are invisible. 
""Hollywood makes it look very, very interesting and very dramatic. And this is a little different. It can look a little anti-climactic,"" Ms Flores said.
Raytheon says the laser system has 20,000 hours of operational use, but Ms Flores would not be drawn on whether the system had been ""used in anger"" yet.
Initially the number of jobs created by the new centre is likely to be small, but could increase to potentially ""hundreds of jobs"".
will depend on many factors of course, but the company believes that high-energy lasers could make up as much as 30% of of future air defence infrastructure.
While the firm would not be drawn on how much it would ultimately invest - citing pending financial results - it has already spent about £20m developing the Livingston site, the BBC understands.
It said the announcement was a ""statement of faith""  in both the UK's engineering sector and the important nature of the technology."	/news/technology-62202119
technology	Music industry as tough as it has always been, watchdog says	"UK's competition watchdog has found streaming has made the music industry challenging for many artists. 
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said more than 80% of recorded music was now listened to via streaming, with more than 138 billion streams in the UK last year.
MPs had demanded a ""complete reset"" of the industry, amid ""pitiful returns"" for artists.
for the CMA to look into the power of the major players.
Although the primary focus of the report was on consumers, the watchdog found a small number of high-profile artists enjoyed most of the financial success while the majority made no substantial earnings.
CMA interim chief executive Sarah Cardell said: ""For many artists, it is just as tough as it has always been - and many feel that they are not getting a fair deal.""
But the report notes streaming has made it easier not only for listeners to access music but also for artists to record and share it.
report addresses the claim most artists are paid far too little for music streams and the business model benefits only big labels and star acts.
A million streams per month would earn an artist only about £12,000 per year, it says.
Spotify is believed to pay between £0.002 and £0.0038 per stream, Apple Music about £0.0059. 
YouTube pays the least - about £0.00052 (0.05p).
Catherine Willcox, of UK country-music duo Ward Thomas, told BBC News: ""Having been in the industry for more than a decade and achieving relative success - a number-one album, sold-out tours and many exciting festival spots - it may appear from the outside that we would be fairly comfortable financially.
""However, with the decline in album sales across the board and the rise in streaming, no-one is fully sure how they will sustain a creative career as the landscape of the industry changes so dramatically.""
CMA noted every artist was competing harder than ever before for each of these streams - both with new artists and, in the form of the back catalogue, all the music ever made.
""We are incredibly lucky to be able to do this full time for the moment,"" Wilcox said, ""but it is always very tenuous - and this is coming from two artists who profit from the masters, the performance rights and live shows. 
""This is even more difficult for songwriters who only get their writer's cut.""
More artists than ever before are releasing music, the report says, but this does not mean more are successful.
Analysis published by the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) shows the number reaching one million UK streams per month remains low,  about 1,700.
""Some of the best songwriters we know have had to secure other sources of income and so can't dedicate the proper time needed to their craft,"" Wilcox said.
""The best songs are yet to be written - but if they aren't being fairly compensated, too many very talented people will be forced to quit."" 
report found streaming was now the primary means for artists and labels to distribute music and the public were embracing it.
Some of the other key findings include:
A number of groups had called for a full market investigation by the CMA - and more solutions to support singers and songwriters. 
But the watchdog rejected this because ""our initial findings have not identified any significant concerns in terms of consumer outcomes relating to music streaming"".
#BrokenRecord campaign was one of those groups - started by Gomez member Tom Gray at the beginning of lockdown, after artists lost touring income. 
He told BBC News: ""A serious concern is the mantra that things have always been this difficult. 
""Indeed 'just as tough as' suggests things may have been worse - but we can see no evidence for such an assertion. 
""The IPO carried out a report into creator earnings last year and could not find data to say where things were in the past, so it feels fairly groundless.
""Creators find it harder now to make income from recorded music than ever before.""
Listeners now have access to a huge choice of music for a fixed monthly subscription fee - and these have fallen in real terms. 
But Mr Gray said this was bad for artists.
""Rhapsody, the first streaming service cost $9.99 in 2001,"" he said.
""Streaming costs the same 21 years later. 
""Obviously, that is a good deal for consumers - but is it destructive to the value of music itself? 
""The answer ought to be, 'Yes.'""
CMA also touched on the ""strong concern"" from some artists labels gave insufficient information about their how their earnings were calculated. 
Mr Gray said: ""Whilst music has always been precarious, the pro-rata system is significantly more 'winner takes all' than anything we've seen before.""
CMA said the market was delivering good outcomes for customers but it would be concerned if:
Association of Independent Music chief executive Paul Pacifico said: ""We welcome the CMA's update report, which reinforces what we know - that building success in music is hard - and underlines the need for organisations across music to work together to secure positive outcomes for the sector.""
British Phonographic Industry chief executive Geoff Taylor also welcomed the findings and said: ""We will continue to engage with the CMA and government to help ensure that the streaming market works to the benefit of artists, songwriters, record companies and fans.""
Ms Cardell said: ""Our initial analysis shows that the outcomes for artists are not driven by issues to do with competition, such as sustained excessive profits.
""We are now keen to hear views on our initial findings, which will help guide our thinking and inform our final report.""
Musicians' Union general secretary Naomi Pohl said it was ""disappointing"" the ""competition issues"" in the streaming market ""will not be explored fully by a CMA investigation"".
""The CMA's release today highlights what it sees as positive impacts of music streaming - but we feel they have failed to recognise the very serious problems posed to creators,"" she said."	/news/technology-62305395

As a reporter Darryl Grimason contributed to programmes such as BBC Radio Ulster's Your Place And Mine and presented Dawn Chorus, Wild Week and special reports on BBC Newsline.
In 2019, he produced the BBC One NI documentary Life And Death On Heroin.
Mr Smyth said Darryl Grimason was a popular staff member within the BBC and would be ""very much missed"".
Beyond his work with the BBC, Darryl Grimason was the author of Reading the Water: A Life Spent Fishing.
Stephen Grimason said his brother had the principle ""born to fish, forced to work""."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-64064186
entertainment	Cost of living: Colder pools and fewer theatre shows	"Swimming pools are having to turn down the heat of their water due to soaring energy costs, the Senedd has been told. 
Senedd's culture and sport committee heard pools were facing an ""energy crisis"" and arts centres were scaling back to stay open.
One rugby club, which raised prices after its utility bills tripled, said its patrons faced ""difficult choices"". 
A theatre company also said it had to cut ticket prices, despite rising costs, fearing they will not sell.
It comes as the leisure and arts sectors said their revenues still have not recovered to pre-pandemic levels.
Andrew Howard, of the Welsh Sports Association, warned colder pools could impact children and the elderly. 
Mr Howard told the committee any centre with high energy usage was ""at threat"" due to rising costs, and swimming pools were particularly vulnerable despite demand increasing since before Covid. 
Leisure centres have already taken steps to reduce running costs, such as reducing pool temperatures, cutting down on social activities and reduced weekend opening hours.
Half of all leisure centres in Wales are run by leisure trusts, and The Welsh Sports Association and Community Leisure UK said most in the sector reported a return of only 80% of pre-Covid levels. 
It said: ""This means that at present there are already fewer people being physically active in leisure centres than there were prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.""
Data from the Community Leisure UK membership also showed that energy costs could be as high as a 200% increase when compared with 2019. 
Owen Hathaway, from Sport Wales, told the committee: ""In the best of times if you live in an area of deprivation you are less likely to participate in sport.""
He said there were safety implications if people, particularly women, chose to run on dark winter nights instead of going to a leisure centre.
Meanwhile, Bedwas RFC near Caerphilly, said it had seen its utility bills triple in recent months.
""The cost of living crisis has had a massive impact.... both on and off the pitch,"" said club secretary Will Rees.
He said the club has had to leave aside ""fixes"" to try to cover day-to-day costs. 
""It gives us less money to reinvest into the facility and into our future players,"" he added.
Mr Rees also said he was concerned the club's income could also start to suffer if problems with the cost of living started to price out its players and supporters from staying involved. 
""Rugby is optional,"" he said. ""People have to prioritise how they're spending and maybe they don't have enough money to come to the club every weekend.
""We try our best to keep our memberships as low as possible for our playing sides, but people have to make tough choices,"" he added.
Meanwhile, Arts Council of Wales (ACW) boss Michael Elliott told the committee more than 50% of arts venues who responded to a recent survey said they were having to reduce their activities.
Recent ACW figures showed audience numbers were only at 60% to 80% of pre-pandemic levels.
Energy costs for arts venues are doubling, despite the six-month support for businesses offered by the UK government, with 40% of venues who responded to the ACW survey saying they would be coming off a fixed energy contract during 2023. 
A number of companies said they were having to ""play safe"" in their choice of events, with the Christmas shows as being particularly important for the sustainability of the sector.
Mr Elliott suggested targeted support of around £5m to £10m was needed to secure the sustainability of the arts sector over the next six months to a year.
Avant Cymru, a theatre group in Tylorstown, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said it was already feeling the effects of people having less money. 
group relies on the support of freelancers and volunteers to put on productions, but the group's artistic director, Rachel Pedley, said that may become impossible to sustain.
""We might be struggling to work with that many people because we can't guarantee pay and we can't be expecting people to work for free"", she said 
Despite already offering reduced ticket prices for many of their productions, Ms Pedley said it may not be enough to entice people to part with their money. 
""I don't think we'll be able to budget in a ticket income"", she said. ""It's too precarious.
""We already had 'pay what you can' options, we already had free spaces for classes,"" she added. 
Clara Cullen, of the Music Venue Trust, also told MSs they were worried some venues would close within six months.
She added many were already closing on weekdays to cut down on running costs.
According to Louise Miles-Payne, director of performing arts body Creu Cymru, producers are having to balance increasing ticket costs with trying to keep tickets affordable for audiences, while there are concerns about a skill shortages as people leave the sector.
She said that a number of arts venues across Wales were also preparing to be ""warm banks"" over the winter, to provide warm places to go for people struggling with energy costs."	/news/uk-wales-63161364
health	Abortion election results: Kentucky rejects constitutional amendment on abortion	"Kentucky has rejected a constitutional amendment that would have said there was no right to abortion.
result here follows three other pro-choice victories in this year's midterm elections: Vermont, Michigan and California have all enshrined the right to abortion in their constitution. 
However, in Kentucky the result won't automatically reverse the state's current legislation, which almost entirely prohibits abortion. 
wave of ballot initiatives - which were voted on alongside other midterm elections - comes on the heels of the June Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v Wade, ending a national guarantee to abortion access. 
In a hotel ballroom in downtown Louisville, Kentucky hours before the results came through, pro-choice advocates milled around, exchanging small talk and nervous smiles, the roomed flanked by bright yellow balloons, emblazoned with the words ""Bans off our bodies"".
Soon after polls closed on Tuesday night, the mood began to shift. Party-goers danced and celebrated, voices raising slowly, until they reached a deafening cheer as vote projections were announced. As returns trickled in, it became clear they would win, defeating a ballot measure that would have explicitly removed abortion rights from Kentucky's constitution.  
""Abortion is a winning issue,"" said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst with the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group. ""Voters want people to have bodily autonomy and agency over their lives. That is pretty core to being an American.""
One more ballot initiative, in Montana, is yet to be called. Voters there were asked to decide on a so-called ""born alive"" measure that would penalise medical staff if they don't provide life-saving care to infants born at all stages of development, including in very rare cases when a live birth occurs after induced abortion.
ghest number of ballot initiatives ever held on abortion in a single US election, following the Supreme Court's decision earlier this year to overturn Roe v Wade - ending the federal guarantee of abortion rights. 
Now, 13 states ban abortion in most cases and others seriously restrict access.
Combined, these five ballot initiatives may change abortion access for millions of people in America. They have also acted as tests of Americans' support for abortion rights, and the extreme bans that have come into place since the fall of Roe. 
So far, at least, pro-choice advocates can claim a resounding victory. 
Across the country on Tuesday, one in four voters said abortion was their top issue when deciding how to vote, according to a Reuters exit poll. And according to Pew Research, 61% of Americans think that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. 
ken together, the results from Vermont, Michigan, California and Kentucky will be a significant blow to members of the anti-abortion movement, which has flooded state legislatures with abortion bans since the end of Roe. 
""Ballot initiatives are tricky, you have to educate voters on unique language - that language can be the death blow sometimes,"" said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America - one of the largest anti-abortion organisations in the country.
Ms Hawkins said her focus would stay on changing state laws, saying her ""dream"" legislation was that of Oklahoma - where abortion is effectively unavailable.  
ro-choice victory did not automatically reverse abortion bans that have gone into effect since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade. 
But a pro-choice vote will strengthen the case for looming legal challenges to the state's two bans. Next week, on 15 November, lawyers with Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) will be in court.
""This was step one in the process,"" said Amber Duke, director of the Kentucky ACLU. ""We'll be in court next week, and this was a key piece for us to be able to keep up that fight."" 
Like in Kansas - where a similar ballot initiative was emphatically defeated - the pro-choice campaign was an uphill battle. Kentucky is a solidly conservative state, where three-quarters of adults identify as Christian, nearly 50% Evangelical and 10% Catholic - two denominations that condemn abortion. 
Anti-abortion Republican Rand Paul is projected to win his seat, and be re-elected, against Democratic challenger Charles Booker.
""It's kind of hard to ignore who our senators are, but they don't speak for all of us,"" said Erin Smith, Executive director of Kentucky Health Justice Network. ""This is people's bodies.""

""I've been bunkered up,"" Dream said. ""The people trying to leak my face, trying to find out what I look like... it's just a tiny bit too much.""
His face would remain absent from his Minecraft videos, he said, but he may start making ""IRL content"" - set in real life - with his friends.
In the days leading up to his public reveal, Dream showed his face to several close contacts, asking them to post their reactions online.

""I will be forever in debt to my viewers and my subscribers. I love you guys."""	/news/technology-63082329
health	COPD lung disease sufferers waiting years for diagnosis	"People living with severe lung disease in Northern Ireland need faster and more accurate care, a leading charity has said. 
One in four patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in the UK wait at least five years for a diagnosis, according to a report from Asthma + Lung UK Northern Ireland.
Up to 42,000 people in NI suffer from COPD, the charity says.
It has called for lung health to become a priority.
""We are hearing shocking stories of people spending years... struggling to breathe, unaware that they have a lung condition which could be managed with the right treatment and support,"" said Joseph Carter, head of Asthma + Lung UK Northern Ireland.
""Diagnosis of COPD needs to be faster and more accurate and there needs to be greater awareness of the seriousness of lung conditions and the signs and symptoms to look out for.""
rity is campaigning for a new lung health strategy to improve diagnostic rates, increase pulmonary rehabilitation services, and reduce the number of respiratory deaths in Northern Ireland.
COPD is an umbrella term for a group of incurable lung conditions which cause breathing difficulties. 
udes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It affects more than one million people in the UK. 
Every patient with COPD should get a yearly flu and a regular pneumonia vaccine, according to the charity. 
uld also have a personalised plan to help them manage their condition, be offered optimised treatment for any other medical conditions and support to stop smoking if they need it. 
Delays in diagnosis of COPD can result in loss of lung function.
report, Delayed Diagnosis and Unequal Care: The reality for people with COPD in the UK in 2022, was published on Tuesday ahead of World COPD Day on Wednesday.
Results are based on a survey of 6,500 people across the UK. The sample size for Northern Ireland was small but the charity said it mirrored the rest of the UK results. 
Sharon Stewart from Dungiven has first-hand experience of the condition after her father was diagnosed in 2018.
""My dad, Jimmy worked as a mechanic and car sprayer for many years,"" she said.
""He was always very outgoing. He played the drums and was a great entertainer. He loved getting out and about.""
When he became ill, there was no clear diagnosis but he had to give up work. 
Sharon said her father was on inhalers for two years before he was finally hospitalised and diagnosed with COPD in 2018. 
""As a family, we felt Jimmy was not getting the proper level of care,"" she said.
""When his breathing worsened, he was no longer able to go out or walk, he was always exhausted and tired.  
""His home life was also affected as it took almost one year for a stairlift to be installed. This meant he stayed most of the time upstairs in his bedroom so that he could access the bathroom.""
k a dire toll on him, she said.
""He was not the same person, he couldn't walk any distance because his breathing was so bad.""
Jimmy died in September 2021 at the age of 74.
family and community helped raise more than £5,700 for Asthma + Lung UK Northern Ireland. 
""We are aware of all the constraints on our health service, but these gaps in care are making things worse,"" said Sharon.
More than a third of people surveyed in the report said they were unable to recognise the signs of COPD and around 23% said they were misdiagnosed as their doctor thought they had a chest infection or cough. 
Respiratory conditions make up one of the top three killers in Northern Ireland.
Asthma + Lung UK Northern Ireland said people with lung conditions in the poorest neighbourhoods are three and half times more likely to die than those in the richest areas in Northern Ireland."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63625674
