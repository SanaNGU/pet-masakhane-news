During di visit, wen Charley boy ask di former president to advise di ""frustrated Nigerians"" Obasanjo tok say, ""Dat we dey poor and frustrated no be di fault of God, na di choice of our leaders."" ""And if you want to change dat and change our situation, you gatz to change leadership. Pure and simple. ""And e no get anybody wey go do am except di youths."" Obasanjo come later describe Nigeria as im own baby wey e go like to put beautiful bead on her waist and no be for any individual body. E get about 109,810,327 pipo wey dey over age 18 inside Nigeria, according to one worldometer report. Na from 18 years and above dem dey reason say pesin don be youth inside di west African kontri. Dis number fit form half of Nigeria population wey dey projected at ova 200 million pipo, according to UNFPA.
