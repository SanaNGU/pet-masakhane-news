business	Cryptocurrency CBN ban in Nigeria: Which African countries dey show support for Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum for di continent?	Even though many of im pipo dey trade in Cryptocurrency, African kontries never show di kain support wey many expect, although some don dey take small-small step to accept am. Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum - dis na some of di popular cryptocurrency wey Africans don dey trade in and di fact say many kontries never recognize am as legal money no stop di growth. One report by sabi company Baker Mckenzie say Nigeria na number three in di world for countries wey dey trade in Bitcoins (wey be di most popular type of cryptocurrency). And Paxful, wey be crypto exchange platform say for 2020, Nigeria na im do crypto trading pass for Africa wit volume of 60,215 Bitcoins wey worth $566,668,692. Some don argue say if African kontries regulate crypto, e go make am dey even more popular, and make di economy ginger. But odas reason am to be like gambling. Make we torchlight wetin some African kontris don tok (or no tok) about di use of cryptocurrency. Di Bank of Ghana no recognize cryptocurrency as legal form of currency, although dem don arrange Bill to regulate cryptocurrency. Nigeria Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) for statement wey dem release for dia official website in 2018 say dem go regulate digital assets like cryptocurrency because 'digital asset offerings' like crypto-token or crypto-coin dey provide anoda wey wey pipo go fit invest or keep dia money as asset. Dis ground breaking statement surprise many as e be say di Central Bank of Nigeria don draw ear before give kontri pipo say dealers and investors in any kind of crypto currency in Nigeria no dey protected by law, according  to one CBN circular on 28 February, 2018. For February 2021, di CBN give order say make financial instructions close down accounts of any customer wey dey involved wit cryptocurrency. Kenya goment no recognise cryptocurrency because of di way e dey difficult to regulate am although dem don form task force wey go torchlight whether dem fit adopt am. As one of di most advanced economies for Africa, dem don dey look into how dem fit allow cryptocurrency. In fact, di national treasury don propose say make dem change di law to recognise am. And di Crypto Assets Regulatory Working Group na im dey responsible to torchlight any law wey fit epp dem legalise crypto. But di South Africa Reserve Bank never comot any law to give am legal backing. Di kontri no be stranger to di different financial trading service wey di world dey move to. Di island country get many forex trading companies wey dey registered dia and for crypto dem don arrange one framework to allow am.	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/tori-55952803
business	Wetin to know about di 13% oil derivation money Nigeria goment share?	"How oil producing states spend di arrears of 13% oil derivation money? Dat na di major question pipo dey ask afta Rivers state govnor Nyesom Wike make im revelation. Di govnor reveal say Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari don approve and release di unpaid 13% derivation deduction since 1999 to all States for di Niger  Delta. Di tok bin come out as claim but BBC Pidgin reach out to oda states for di region to confam say na true. Oga Wike during one of im programmes for Port Harcourt say di payment of dis money by President Buhari na di major source of revenue for im projects. “Make I tok am for di first time. So many pipo dey ask wia i dey get dis money?' Make I tok am. Na from mister President,” e tok. E add say “Money wey dem never pay to di Niger Delta states since 1999 wey be di 13 percent deductions presido approve and pay all of us from di Niger Delta states.”  Di derivation principle na say if dem dey collect natural resources for any state wey dey bring revenue, goment go give back a certain percentage of dat revenue back to dat State. Goment go den put di remaining money for di Federation Account wey dem go share to oda States, na so di law tok. Di 13% derivation fund dey come from di federation revenue to oil producing communities through di State goments as e dey for  Section 162 (2) of di Nigerian constitution. Di federal goment dey pay dis 13% derivation to oil producing areas as part of benefits transfer scheme for di oil resources wey dem take from di State and eight states currently dey benefit from di scheme Di states na Rivers, Delta, Akwa Ibom, Edo, Bayelsa states, Imo and Abia states. Di 13% derivation fund dey different from di 3% money wey dem dey give host communities for di Petroleum Industry Act from di oil company operating expenses (OPEX). Data from di National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) show say oil producing states for Nigeria share N450.60 billion from di Federation account through di 13 percent derivation formula for 2021. NBS data show say Abia, Akwa Ibom,  Bayelsa, Delta,  Edo, Imo, Lagos, Rivers and Ondo States receive di money. Delta State receive di highest amount with a total of N141.93 billion, representing 31% of di total revenue from di derivation account. Akwa Ibom receive N91.16 billion representing 20%. For di first quarter of 2022, di eight oil-producing states for di kontri receive N144.31 billion from di Federation account. ""On di 13% derivation,  Governor Okowa goment dey transparent, accountable on all financial dealings on behalf of di pipo,"" na so di Delta state goment tok. Di Niger-Delta state say di total amount due to di state from di 13% derivation arrears na N240 billion out of which di Federal Goment agree to pay in quarterly instalment for a period of five years. Oga Fidelis Tilije, Commissioner for Finance say contrary to di ""revelation"" by Wike, Delta State only receive N14.7 billion in three quarterly instalments of N4.9 billion each. ""Wit di agreed amounts settled, some states like Rivers approach commercial banks and discount dia own in full and collect am, but Senator Ifeanyi Okowa say im no go wan leave di next administration with a huge debt burden. So e decide to discount only N150 billion out of di N240 billion expected receivables but later cut am down to N100 billion, di finance commissioner explain. ""So far, we don get N14.7 billion in three quarterly instalments and we also don access N30 billion out of di N100 billion we apply for as bridging finance.” Bayelsa State govnor, Senator Douye Diri  for im reaction  say dem dey spend di 13% oil derivation funds mostly on infrastructure development. Senator Diri  add say di monthly allocations di State dey receive from di Federation Account always dey public through dia monthly transparency briefings so dem no get any tin to hide. E come explain say wetin di state receive as 13% derivation refund from di time of di previous administration dey come in instalments. Dis na afta dem don discount am but add say di amount no make much impact in terms of development. Governor Diri say di cost of construction for a difficult terrain like Bayelsa dey three or more times dan oda places. E say di cost of constructing one road project for di State plenty pass di budget to build three or four flyovers for some oda tates even for di Niger Delta. “For pipo wey dey tok about di 13% derivation funds wey dey due di state, I wan tok here say for one reason or di oda, we bin dey under-paid. “Wen we discover am, we follow due process from di state executive council to di State House of Assembly. ""We get di approvals and di funds come dey discounted. I no dey play politics with dis kain tin. “Anybodi  wey wan see how we use our money, our monthly transparency briefings for on our financial income and expenditure dey  available.,” di govnor tok. Edo State goment say out of  di N28 billion wey be di share of di State from di One trillion naira arrears of 13% derivation wey dey due to oil producing States, dem don only receive N2.1billion. Commissioner for finance, Budget, Economic Planning and Development Joseph Eboigbe explain say dem don receive three quarterly release of N700 million wey give a total of N2.1 billion and di Accountant General get di records. ""Our share na N28 billion,  di net go dey distributed over five years quarterly so dat go be 20 quarterly instalment releases and three don come so far and each na N700 million, N700 million, N700 million. How we spend dat money we get di records for anybody wey wish to see am."" e tok. Akwa Ibom State goment say all di amount wey dey due to di state and wey dem don receive dey duly reflected for di 2021 budget and supplementary budget for dat year. Commissioner for Finance, Nsikan Nkan for statement explain say for di current financial year, di expected refund from di subhead. E say e also dey clearly captured for di budget and di Accountant General report also declare di amount dem receive as refunds from arrears of di 13% derivation fund. Nkan add say even di budget for 2023 wey currently dey before di Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly also include di sum wey dey expected to come from di arrears refunds and dem capture an as ""Other Exceptional Income: 13% derivation revenue arrears."" ""Concerning di arrears of 13% derivation refunds, na di affected Governors naim discover and make di demand through dia officers for Federation Accounts Allocation Committee FAAC, and FAAC  agree with dem and calculate di sum wey dey due to each State. Nkan come ask di public to ignore any figure wey dey for various media platforms as dem no be true. E add say with di International Public Sector Accounting system (IPAS) wey di state goment don implement, e no dey possible for any unaccounted expenditure to occur. W﻿e go dey update dis tori wit more informate from oda states."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/czr4eg93mglo

But di Nigeria High Commissioner to London, Ambassador Sarafa Tunji Isola say di travel restrictions na ""travel apartheid"". So why Nigeria dey di red list, and e dered list 1y fair? Wetin be red list? Nigeria na di latest African kontri to join UK travel red list - wit South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Angola, Mozambique, Malawi and Zambia. Di only pipo wey dey allowed to enta UK from dis kontris na UK or Irish citizens, or UK residents. Pipo wey arrive from red list kontris go need to enta hotel quarantine - wit dia own moni - and isolate for 10 days. Dem dey target dis kontris sake of Omicron variant wey dem first identify for southern Africa. But di fact say all di kontris wey currently dey di list na from Africa, don dey criticised as ""wicked and unfair"". Di decision to put kontri for dis list dey based on risk assessments from di Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) - one scientific body wey dey advise goment. Dis assessment include: Di UK goment tok say dem add Nigeria to di list be say: Di JBC report summarise informate wey dem use make specific decision for each kontri, but dem neva publish di one for Nigeria. UK goment statement wey announce Nigeria addition to di red list said ""majority"" of Omicron variant cases for UK ""get clear links to overseas travel from South Africa and Nigeria"". Reported Covid cases for Nigeria dey far lower compared wit most of Europe, wia dem dey identify around 90 cases a day ova di past week - but testing for Africa dey way below Europe levels. During di last week of November, Nigeria do about 0.07 tests per 1,000 pipo a day, as dem compare am wit about 14 per 1,000 for UK and about 8 per 1,000 for France. Nigeria still identify fewer cases per test for week wey enta 2 December dan several oda European kontris plus South Africa wia dem first detect Omicron. Based on test mata, all kontris dey collect and share data differently and dis dey make am tricky to compare internationally. UK goment collect data on pipo wey test positive for Covid afta dem arrive UK. Di latest informate or data wey we get from di beginning of November, wey show percentage of pipo wey test positive afta dem travel from Nigeria dey around 1% - similar to several European kontris. Nigerian Centers for Disease Control (NCDC) don identify only three cases of Omicron for di kontri, all of dem dey linked to travel from South Africa. Dis na fewer cases dan several European kontris, including UK wia dem don report 336 Omicron cases. However NCDC data dey five days old, so di numbers fit don go up since. Genome sequencing - di process wey dem dey use to identify variants of virus - no dey advanced for Nigeria compared wit UK or South Africa, for example. Dis fit mean say dem no fit effectively tell di extent of di spread of Omicron. Di genome sequencing wey dem need to identify new variants dey very sophisticated and e rare. Di Department of Health say for England, 21 Omicron cases get link to travel from Nigeria. Kontri vaccination rate na also wetin dem dey consider before restricting travel, although dis na just ""contextual information"" plus genome sequencing ability and Covid transmission. Vaccination rates for Africa dey well below di world average. For Nigeria, as of 5 December, na just 4.8 doses dem don give per 100 people, compared with more than 178 per 100 people for UK."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/world-59551630

Normally, Treatments fall into two camps - those wey dey directly attack di virus and dey more likely to dey useful for di first phase and drugs to calm di immune system wey dey more likely to work for di second. Since President Trump test positive for coronavirus, e don dey receive some number of different drugs, according to wetin im doctors reveal. So which drugs dem dey use and wetin e tell us about Trump condition? Dis steroid dey save lives by calming di immune system, but dem need to use am for di right time. Give am too early and di drug fit make tins worse by hindering di body ability to fight off di virus. Dis no be di kind of drug wey you go usually give pesin wey dey di ""mild"" stage of di disease. One trial of di drug wey take place for UK show say di benefit dey come in for di point wey pesin need oxygen - wey Presido Trump receive briefly. World Health Organization advise di using of di steroid for ""severe and critical"" cases. Dis na combination of antibodies, wey dis company Regeneron dey make, and e dey mimic di human being immune response. Di antibodies physically stick to di coronavirus so dat e no fit get inside di body cells and dey make di virus more ""visible"" to di rest of di immune system. Dem first develop dis antiviral drug as treatment for Ebola.  E dey work by confusing di virus as e look chemically similar to some di raw materials di virus need to replicate. Dis dey scata di virus ability to make thousands of copies of itself. Clinical trials don show say di drug dey cut di duration of symptoms from 15 days down to 11. But no evidence don show weda dem don save live with remdesivir. President Trump doctors tok say e also dey take zinc, vitamin D, famotidine, Melatonin and Aspirin. E no dey clear if any of these na purposely for Covid 19. Zinc na mineral wey get role for di immune system, but no evidence on show say dis kain supplements dey improve pipo ability to fight di virus. Vitamin D dey known as di sunshine vitamin as e dem form for di skin as response to sunlight. E also get role to play for healthy immune system, but again no evidence don show say taking supplements dey help against Covid 19. Famotidine dey decrease stomach acid production and dem dey use am for pipo with stomach ulcers or reflux. E get one small study wey suggest say e fit help, but dem consider di quality low and researchers don call for more research. Melatonin na hormone wey di body dey make in di evening and e dey help us sleep. Dem dey sometimes give am as treatment for insomnia. Aspirin na pain killer and blood thinner wey dem dey use take reduce di risk of blood clots. Covid patients dey experience unusual blood clotting and e fit also calm inflammation inside di body.

Dem accuse di president of covering up di theft of one large sum of foreign currency from im farm in 2020, some of which bin dey hidden inside one sofa. Di debate before di vote bin focus on an independent report wey conclude say e fit don violate di constitution. Oga Ramaphosa, wey dey prepare for re-election as ANC leader, deny any wrongdoing. Di African National Congress bin tell im MPs to block possible impeachment - although a handful break ranks and join hand with opposition parties and vote to accept di report and let impeachment proceedings start. Now wey Oga Ramaphosa don survive di vote, belief dey say e dey likely to win re-election for im party conference, wey go start on Friday. E go den be in pole position to become di ANC presidential candidate for di next election in 2024. Di sitting to debate to di report, wey dey commission from one panel of legal experts by di speaker, open wit one discussion over whether dem should allow MPs to vote in secret - something wey di speaker bin reject. At di end of di debate, dem read out di names of individual MPs and each one announce dia vote. Some 214 lawmakers vote against setting up impeachment committee, while 148 vote in favour, dem register two abstention. Di 70-year-old leader don deny any wrongdoing calling di report, wey e don also challenge for di Constitutional Court, ""flawed"". Oga Ramaphosa become president for 2018 pledging to tackle corruption. Naim  replace Jacob Zuma, whose time for office bin dey weighed down by many such allegations. Dis scandal show facein June, wen one former South African spy boss, Zuma-ally Arthur Fraser, file one complaint wit police accusingdi president of hiding theft of $4m (£3.25m) in cash from im Phala Phala game farm in 2020. Oga Ramaphosa admit say dem bin tiff some money, wey bin dey hidden in a sofa, but e say na $580,000 not $4m. Di president say di $580,000 bin come from di sale of buffalo, but di panel, wey dey headed by one former chief justice, say e get ""substantial doubt"" about whether a sale take place. South Africa get strict rules on holding foreign currency, wey say dat it gatz dey deposited with an authorised dealer such as bank with 30 days. E appears as though di president fit don break those rules, according to di panel report. Furthermore, if di money na from selling buffalo as e tok, dis money supposed dey declared, rather dan keep am in cash. For im submission to di Constitutional Court, Oga Ramaphosa want di kontri top judges to rule say di findings of di panel dey unlawful and set aside. Di president argue say di panel go beyond im scope wen dem dey look  at whether e bin get a case to answer related to di robbery for di farm. E dey also ask di court make dem declare say any steps wey di parliament take on di back of di release of the report dey unlawful and invalid. Analysis by Nomsa Maseko, BBC News, Johannesburg Di dominance of di ANC for parliament don save Oga Ramaphosa future in politics. Im chances of being re-elected as ANC president for di party national conference now don get more boost. However, events for parliament show say once again deep divisionsdey for di governing party. Four Pro-Zuma supporters, wey include former African Union chairperson, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma - one ogbonge party member - bin vote with opposition parties. Di opposition bin try, and fail, to push for secret ballot as dem sense say more members fit break ranks. But Tuesday win na only political, and not legally binding. Oga Ramaphosa go still need to get di Constitutional Court to weigh in on di mata, though some experts say di judges dey likely to side wit am afta parliament, wey commission di investigate, bin reject im own report. For now, on top of one huge sigh of relief, Oga Ramaphosa march on wit severe political bruises - im credibility and ability to govern go come into even sharper focus."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/c9rl22gyln4o

Na wia Cristiano Ronaldo dey expected to make im second debut for Manchester United. Dia game against Newcastle na 15:00 BST dat na 3pm West African time. ""I no think say Ronaldo go  start,"" na so BBC football expert Mark Lawrenson. ""But im go definitely play some part - and, no, I no go dey surprised at all if im score."" See Lawrenson Premier League predictions for match week four. Dis week im guest na singer and guitarist Justin Young from indie rock band The Vaccines, wey im new album Back In Love City go dey out on Friday. Justin na United fan wey dey excited for di return of Ronaldo, but say im no dey sure of wetin to expect from di Reds dis season. ""Once again we dey start di season wit wetin if you look for paper, na correct team - maybe even better wit di return of CR7,"" Im tell BBC Sport. LAWRO PREDICTIONS Games go kick off at 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated SATURDAY Tottenham neva do anything spectacular so far but dem don do really well to win every Premier League game 1-0 - especially because I feel say dia defence na weak link. I'd still fancy Spurs to win dis one and continue their 100% winning start, even though Son no dey fit, but I no dey to worried about Crystal Palace wait for dia first league win under Patrick Vieira. Lawro prediction: 0-1 Justin prediction: Dis game go tough for Palace. Dem no dey look great, but Spurs good. 0-3 Arsenal results so far dey very bad so far but surely dem go get something out of dis bottom-of-di-table clash. We know say Norwich go fight hard dis season to avoid relegation. Lawro prediction: 2-0 Justin prediction: Arsenal get better players pass Norwich have, but as tins be now e no look good. Norwich feel say dem fit get something dia. 1-1 Na so far, so good for Brentford wey still dey unbeaten afta three league games. Brighton go expect a noisy atmosphere like di one wey we saw when di Bees beat Arsenal for di first game of di season because di home fans go just dey enjoy dia self. Justin's prediction: Brentford na classic newly promoted team wit plenty ginger - , so I dey support di Bees here. 1-0 As I dey tok, Manchester City still dey hope say dem go dey allowed to play Brazil duo Ederson and Gabriel Jesus but I still fancy them here without those two, even though e go mean say third-choice keeper Scott Carson go step in because Zack Steffen dey also unavailable. Leicester get a  bit of history against Pep Guardiola' Manchester City, including beating them for  last month Community Shield, but di Foxes go face a different animal dis time. Lawro prediction: 1-2 Justin' prediction: I no want to write Leicester off, but Manchester City dey look pretty strong. 1-2 Newcastle badly need a win, but Old Trafford, on di day wey Ronaldo dey return, no be di place or time to get am. Lawro prediction: 3-0 Justin prediction: Based on Ronaldo history and how im dey always marks every occasion to do something special, I dey expect a goal from am and a win for Manchester United, based on say Newcastle no dey form right now. 3-0 Southampton na another team without a victory so far but I feel say their performances  better pass their results for their first three games. West Ham, meanwhile, don win two out of three and go maintain dia 100% record if to say dem no allow dia lead slip twice for home against Crystal Palace before di international break. Lawro's prediction: 2-1 Justin's prediction:  1-0 Watford don lose their past two games afta dem starting their season with a win ova Aston Villa and I no dey see that run ending dia weekend. Wolves dey without a point or even a goal so far but dem don create plenty chances and surely that go soon change , whether Mexican striker Raul Jimenez dey allowed to play or not. Lawro's prediction: 1-2 Justin's prediction: Dis one dey hard to call. 2-2 I bin dey impressed by Chelsea for dia draw wit Liverpool before di international break - Dem bin play well wen dem bin get  11 men and dem still do well when dem go down to 10. Aston Villa no go lack energy or effort but di Blues go dey too strong for them. Lawro prediction: 2-0 Justinprediction: Chelsea go win dis one. 3-1 Leeds form no too solid  like dat so far dis season, but I feel say dem go struggle, to bounce back I dey go wit Liverpool. Di  Reds go plenty of opportunities in front of goal. Lawro prediction: 1-2 Justin prediction: Dis go be good, open game but Liverpool suppose win am. 0-2 Everton start to di season dey good  under Rafa Benitez and I dey expect dem to continue here. Burnley go make life difficult for them, of course - but the Toffees get enough quality to break them down. Lawro prediction: 2-0 Justin prediction: 1-1 How to watch di matches?

Europe gas prices dey up by like 2% trading above one earlier all-time high afta Russia invade Ukraine. Critics accuse di Russian goment say dem dey gas as political weapon. Russia don dey cut flows through di Nord Stream 1 pipeline to Germany, and now e dey operate at less dan a fifth of dia normal capacity. Germany dey import 55% of im gas from Russia and most of am dey come thru Nord Stream 1 - with di rest coming from land-based pipelines. Russian energy firm, Gazprom dey try justify di latest cut by say dem need am to allow maintenance work on one turbine. Di German goment, however, tok say no technical reason for dem to limit di supply. Ukraine dey accuse Moscow say dem dey do ""gas war"" against Europe and to cut supplies dey inflict ""terror"" on pipo. Di UK no dey directly affected by gas supply disruption, as dem dey import less dan 5% of dia gas from Russia. Howeva, dem go dey affected by prices wey dey increase for di global markets as demand for Europe increase. UK gas prices rise 7% on Wednesday so di price now dey more than six times higher than a year ago. However, e still dey well below di peak wey dey notice during di aftermath of Russia invasion of Ukraine. UK energy bills increase by £700 for April, and dey expected to rise again as one management consultancy dey sama warning say typical energy bill fit hit £3,850 a year by January, much higher than wetin dem forecasts early dis month. BFY tok say dia forecast reflect di increase in wholesale prices ova di past few weeks with di ongoing tensions with Russia wey dey increase concerns ova winter supplies. Di latest reduction in flows put pressure on EU kontries to reduce dia dependence on Russian gas even further, and e go likely make am more difficult for dem to refill dia gas supplies ahead of winter. Since di invasion of Ukraine, European leaders don do tok-tok ova how to reduce dia dependence on Russian fossil fuels. On Tuesday, di European Union agree to cut gas use in case Russia stop supplies but some kontries go get exemptions to avoid rationing. EU members now don agree to by demsef to reduce 15% of gas use between August and March. Howeva, di deal dey watered down afta e previously no get exemptions. Di EU don tok say dia aim from di deal na to make savings and store gas ahead of winter, warning say Russia dey ""continuously using energy supplies as a weapon"". Di voluntary agreement go become mandatory if supplies reach crisis levels. Di EU agreed for May to ban all Russian oil imports wey dey come in by sea by di end of dis year, but one deal ova gas ban don take longer. Since Russia invade Ukraine for February di price of wholesale gas don already go up, with serious impact on consumer energy bills across di world. Di Kremlin dey blame di increase in price on Western sanctions, insisting say dem be reliable energy partner and no dey responsible for di recent disruption to gas supplies."	https://www.bbc.com/pidgin/articles/cw0jgq0lxzpo

health	Vagina health and sex: 24 things about vagina every woman suppose know	"Many women no too sabi plenty things about dia vagina. Even for dis 21st century, tori about anatomy, monthly changes, hygiene and plenty tori wey dem fit dey experience still dey strange to some women. Some experts don put together some things wey fit help women understand dia female sexual organ [vagina] beta. Di vagina dey inside di body - na di elastic muscular canal wey connect di vulva to di cervix and di uterus. Vulva na di correct word to use wen you dey tok about di external part of di female sex organs. Na di vulva hold di pubis, urethral opening, clitoris, labia minora and the labia majora and vaginal opening. Di external structure of di vulva consist of di labia majora - dis na di outer lips of di vagina, di labia minora - di inner lips and di clitoris - one highly sensitive & erogenous zone wey get more nerve endings than any other part of woman body. Dis fit shock you. While men dey pee from their penis, women dey pee from di urethra (one tubular structure wey dey carry piss from di bladder to outside of di body). From front to back, di first hole na di urethra and then di vagina, wey dey above di anus. Public hair get work wey e dey do. E dey serve as protective barrier to di genital tissues and vaginal opening. E also dey prevent infection. Obstetrician-gynaecologist, Dr Jen Gunter say she notice say plenty women dey like shave dia pubic hair. She say e dey okay but e get risk. Dr Gunter add join say waxing or shaving of di pubic hair fit cause microscopic trauma to di skin, plus e fit cause cuts, abrasions, infections. Many women dey shy to tok about di pain dem dey experience during kerewa [sex]. However, E dey important to know say sex no suppose dey painful. Sabi pipo advise say if you dey experience any kain pain during kerewa visit your doctor or gynaecologist. Di glands wey dey located for di lining of di vagina dey release one fluid wey naturally dey designed to dey lubricate and cleanse di vagina. When you use some kain soaps or cleaning devices, dem fit cause react wit di vagina natural pH balance and cause infections like thrush. To avoid dis, apply soap for di outer labia only. Dr Gunter say you no need use anything clean inside di vagina. She warn against using scented douches alias bathing soap as e fit increase di risk of catching sexually transmitted infections. Steaming, another trend, no dey necessary, e fit lead to burns. You fit clean di outer part of di vulval area when necessary wit water or a gentle cleanser. Vaginal cells dey replace themselves every 96 hours - e dey quick heal. You still fit catch some STDs (Sexually Transmitted Diseases) even if you use condom. STDs like herpes, HPV, pubic lice and molluscum contagiosum still dey transferable. Dis na because di vulva still fit touch di blocus (or vice versa), during sex and dis fit cause infection. Most women no dey reach climax through vaginal penetration and sometimes dey need clitoral stimulation before dem fit experience orgasm. Dem fit achieve orgasm through masturbation, manual or cunnilingual stimulation by a sexual partner. Plenty lubrication of di vagina dey prevent painful sex and tissue tearing. Vaginal lubrication dey affected by di level of oestrogen for di body. Things like using birth control, menopause and breastfeeding fit change di oestrogen levels. Di lower your oestrogen levels, di more difficult e go dey for your vagina to lubricate naturally. As women dey grow old, di natural lubrication [wey be di wetness for di vagina] go dey dry up. Dem fit begin topical oestrogen treatments or manufactured vaginal lubricants to lubricate. If you get very dry vagina, you fit speak to your doctor and get solution. Whether you do operation (C-section) or you born naturally, most physicians dey recommend taking at least four to six weeks off before you begin kerewa, make di vagina for fit heal well-well. To dey get orgasm fit help relieve menstrual pain. Dis na because of di increase of blood flow wey dey occur during climaxing. In addition, when you orgasm, your uterine muscles go contract and release chemicals di brain wey go generate one natural pain reliever for menstrual cramps. Afta years of doing periods and maybe to born children, di ovaries go stop to dey produce eggs and menstruation go stop. Di amount of hormones for di body wey dey keep women fertile go drop dramatically - and low levels of oestrogen, in particular, dey affect di vagina and vulva. Vaginal farting [to mess] wey pipo sabi as ""queefing"", go happun to most women at some point for dia lives, especially during exercise and intercourse. Dis na because air dey escape from vagina and e go make dem dey mess. Pregnancy and childbirth fit change di vagina in plenty ways; Every single woman get different vagina odour sake of dia choice of fabric, from wetin dem like use as underwear, level of hygiene, diet, gland secretion and unique mix of internal bacteria. Di quality and quantity of vaginal discharge dey change sake of di different stages of your menstrual cycle. E usually dey be like off white wey look creamy tint when your cycle wan start. Small-small, di amount of discharge go dey increase as you dey near ovulation. When ovulation start, di discharge go dey thick small and e go dey pull when you touch am. E dey recommended make women do Kegel exercises afta dem born pikin to strengthen di vaginal muscles again.  Kegels dey easy to do and you fit do am anywhere at any time. In order for sperm to survive and swim inside di vagina, di vagina dey maintain acidic environment wit a pH balance of 4.5. Douching dey considered to be more harmful than beneficial as e dey disrupt di natural balance of bacteria and fit lead to infection. Most women no dey ejaculate during orgasm, but if you do, beta for you. Female ejaculation fit occur as di result of two different phenomena wey most pipo no sabi. Ejaculation dey produced in a small amount wit a milky or cloudy appearance, e dey comot from di paraurethral glands wey dey inside di urethra. for women wey dey experience ejaculation, di sensation dey orgasmic and e different from wen women dey piss. Dis two structures resemble well-well. Just like di penis, di clitoris get di frenulum (di small fold and ridge of di skin wey support di motion) and a prepuce (or 'clitoral hood' na fold of skin wey cover am). Di clitoral hood dey comprised of di same kind of tissues wey make up di foreskin for males. Like di penis, di clitoris get erectile tissues wey dey stand upon arousal.
