Di African Continental Free Trade Area go unite 1.3 billion pipo, create $3.4 trillion economic bloc and increase goods exchange inside di continent. Unto say e take African kontris four years to agree to free-trade deal in March afta dem don dey plan for almost seventeen years, dis na wetin Nigeria must fix to enjoy Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement. As tins stand now Nigeria dey import plenti cars sake of say dem no get booming car manufacturing industry. Tori be say tariffs for cars gatzs fall to allow oda Africa kontries to enta di free market wey go also allow export of cars to Nigeria.  At di moment na only car assembling plants dey di kontri. For Nigeria to make money for cars den dem must strike deals wey go see dem begin manufacture car. Nigeria still dey stagger around 4,000MW power generation for di kontri wey get nearly 200 million pipo. For businesses to boom, dem go need steady power to keep business running. How to address dat challenge must be part of di areas Nigeria gatz fix odawise di oda African kontries wey get steady power go take beta advantage of dis free trade plan. Nigeria banking sector dey solid but e still get some small come like access to forex and double digit  interest rates for bank loans, so dis na some tin wey di Central Bank and di kontri bankers committee to review to make sure say money dey di hands of Nigerians wey wan do Business. Nigeria get one of di worst border road wey link to oda west African kontris, di Lagos/Badagry highway just as di Apapa road wey lead to di kontri busiest seaport don dabaru.

Nigeria dey re-develop dia railways and airports and dis na time to quickly finish work. Nigeria na oil rich kontri, but e still dey import refine crude oil becos none of di refineries for di kontri dey refine crude oil. Wit dis free trade arrangement oda African kontries suppose sell dia refined crude even for interested Nigerians - but dis go be big shame if dis one happun, however somtin like dis dey possible for di AfCFTA plan. Textile industry for Nigeria don die finish, but di kontri get wetin e take to bounce back and if dem must benefit from dis free trade area wella, di textile industry of di kontri must wake up again and begin production. At di moment, African countries dey trade only about 16% of dia goods and services among one another, compared to 65% wey European kontries dey do according to AFP news agency. AU dey reason say if kontries follow di African Continental Free Trade Area plan, - E go lead to 60% boost of trade between kontries by 2022. Dem also say AfCFTA go create di world largest free trade area. For oga Yusuf, ""dis agreement go give Nigerian producers opportunity and access to bigger market of over 1.2 billion pipo, and access to bigger economy of $2 trillion."" Oga Yusuf say dis ""na opportunity for Nigerians to express demself beyond di boundaries of just Nigeria"" alone and ""consumers too go enjoy from di competition wey go dey."" Sabi pipo say di economic benefits of AfCFTA dey far more dan di dis advantage but until dis areas dey fixed, e go hard for many Nigerians to enjoy di free trade area.

health	Coronavirus in Kenya: 'I bury my cousin on Facebook Live'	"Dem place di chairs at least 1m (3ft) apart - family sidon for one side, church officials for di oda. Evribodi wear facemask. Evrione know di serious instructions wey di Kenyan goment don put for burials during di coronavirus pandemic. Only 15 pipo gather for di burial of my cousin, Chris, and everytin need finish by 09:00 local time. By 07:00 di rest of us gather, in front of our phones and computers, dey watch as di burial dey happun as my friend live-stream am on Facebook. Hundreds of us watch to pay our last respect to Chris. Im be pipo pesin - di life and soul of family parties. Im deep laugh go reach you even before e set foot inside di house - in fact, you fit hear am 200m away for gate. And Chris normally dey show up for pipo, weda na burial or weddings. E sabi ginger pipo for all occasions. So, on dis day, we show up for am too. But as we no dey dia, e no feel like na di same tin. Chris na my immediate cousin, but dem raise us for di same house and im bin be more like brother to me. Im die for Kisumu for western Kenya on Easter Sunday, afta e sick for few weeks wit liver cirrhosis. Di goment give us di guidelines for e burial. We gatz bury am within three days. But wit many of e family and friends under lockdown for di capital, Nairobi, no be evribodi fit attend di burial. Di sermon bin dey short. Di speeches bin dey restricted. And even singing no too dey. Chris bin love music wen e dey alive - im play di drum kit for di Salvation Army church band. So e dey painful say nobodi bin dey dia to play im favourite songs. I watch as live comments from e friends and colleagues begin appear in on Facebook. In order to use internet comfort demsef, pipo leave RIP messages and tok of how great a man Chris be wen im dey alive. And I bin tink say, maybe I for take screenshots and print am out becos dis mainly become our condolences book. Everytin bin feel so different.  We no fit hug, touch or see each other tears. We no fit throw sand on di coffin as dem dey put am for grave. When pesin wey you love die, we wan cry, look for comfort and closure. But how yo go do dis kind tins wen you no dey dia? I bin vex. I no ever imagine say I go bury my loved one through social media. I no ever tink say I go want human contact that much. E bin dey like feem, except say I dey part of pipo wey act am. And sadly, di Facebook Live fail, due to a poor network connection. So I no fit even watch Chris final journey to di very end. I no see wen dem put e coffin down inside grave. For many African societies death and life are dey togeda. Many traditions see death as rite of passage - a transition to another form. Hence why ancestors dey important - dem be di pipo wey don die but kontinu to ""live"" for di community. Dis, in turn, mean say wen pipo die dem must receive perfect burial - complete with rituals wey dem don observe for generations. For di communities for western Kenya wia I come from, like di Luo and Luhya, wen dem born pesin die and wen di pesin die na two important events. Dem dey treat pesin wey die wit respect and death and burial process dey to follow, to ensure mistake no dey. First of all burials dem no dey rush burials, especially for old pesin. Pesin death na call for celebration, even though pipo dey mourn and cry. E dey take at least one week to bury adult pesin. Loud mourning and crying, go last for days. Pipo come togeda to help di family of di pesin wey die to mourn. Dem go light Bonfire and pipo go gather around dem, embrace, cry, and relive di life of di pesin wey die. To kill animal dey part of di ritual, and di preparation and serving of food and drinks to console mourners. Na show of unity amongst neighbours and family.
