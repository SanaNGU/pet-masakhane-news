sports	Six Nations 2022: What is the tournament's greatest match of all time?	"The Six Nations has delivered some of the most memorable matches in rugby history, but which was the greatest of them all?
Former British and Irish Lions captain Sam Warburton and ex-England scrum-half Danny Care debate and discuss that question on the latest episode of Six Nations Greatest.
x matches they came up with are ranked in reverse order below. Take a trip down memory lane, then rank them yourself at the bottom of this page.
What happened: Scotland led 24-14 with seven minutes to go in Cardiff, but a yellow card for replacement hooker Scott Lawson gave Wales hope. 
Leigh Halfpenny scored under the posts in the 77th minute and, after Scotland's Phil Godman was sin-binned, Stephen Jones took three points to level things at 24-24 with 15 seconds remaining. 
With the clock in red, Shane Williams found his way over to seal victory as the Cardiff crowd exploded with joy.
Warburton: It was my first Six Nations campaign and I just remember Wales being completely outplayed. We were chasing the game. 
I remember running back to the halfway line with Johnathan Thomas and I remember the noise was so loud celebrating and we were looking at each other talking, from about a metre away, I could see his mouth moving but could hear nothing. It was just a wall of noise. 
You hardly ever win in that dramatic fashion. At international level you get one of those every four or five years.
What happened: England travelled to Cardiff chasing a Grand Slam in the Championship decider. Wales, beaten at home by Ireland in round one, needed a winning margin of at least seven points to take the title. 
As England's discipline crumbled, Wales led by six at the break but two second-half tries from wing Alex Cuthbert helped the hosts to a record winning margin of 27 points.
Warburton: We did our anthem and it was out of this world. It was ridiculous. My single greatest moment, without a doubt. Emotionally that game drained us. 
People probably think that we had the biggest party of the year but I remember going back to the hotel, most of us sat down, had a bottle of beer and we literally just sat there for about three hours. It was just an enormous weight off our shoulders.
Care: We weren't prepared for what was to hit us in that caldron, that atmosphere we met. It was all Wales and we couldn't wrestle back any momentum. It was probably one of the harshest lessons I've learnt.
What happened: Wales went to Paris seeking a Grand Slam and, after a fast-scoring start for both sides, Josh Adams' try edged the visitors ahead. Victory seemed secure when they led by 10 points with three minutes remaining. 
France lost Paul Willemse to a red card, before two Welsh players were sin-binned and with the man advantage, Charles Ollivon made it across the try-line in the 77th minute. With the clock in red, Brice Dulin crossed to break Welsh hearts.
Warburton: That was agonising because it would have been Alun Wyn Jones' second Grand Slam as captain. It just shows how tough the Six Nations is… to win away from home and to win a Championship. Wales did everything they had to do for 79 minutes and 50 seconds but they lost in the end.
What happened: Ireland travelled to Wales seeking their first Grand Slam in 61 years. Wales led 6-0 at the break thanks to two Stephen Jones penalties, but Brian O'Driscoll's pick-and-go try and an incredible take by Tommy Bowe down the right wing put Ireland ahead. 
wo more penalties from Jones brought Wales to within two points and his 76th-minute drop-goal seemed to seal victory. But Ronan O'Gara scored a drop-goal of his own with two minutes remaining to make Irish rugby history.
Warburton: It was such a dramatic away win for Ireland that went right to the wire. For the two seconds it takes to score a drop-goal, the whole stadium holds their breath. Maybe not the most entertaining game from minute one to 80 but the significance it has for Ireland puts it in our top six.
What happened: England travelled to Dublin hoping for a first Grand Slam since 1995, having lost on the final weekend in several recent attempts. Ireland were looking to secure a first clean sweep since 1948. 
floodgates opened in the second half as Mike Tindall crossed, Will Greenwood made it over twice and Dan Luger scored. Jonny Wilkinson added 15 points from the boot - including two drop-goals - to complete a comprehensive win.
Warburton: England just did a demolition job and I remember watching it thinking that's what cut-throat, ruthless, world-class dominating teams do. Away at Ireland is one of the hardest away games you can have. To go there and deliver with such dominance sent a message to the rest of the world.
Care: It was such a unique game in that both teams were going for the Slam [on the final day]. It was all to play for.
What happened: A heavy defeat for Scotland seemed certain when England raced into a 31-point lead after half an hour. A second-half blitz by Scotland made it 31-31 and Sam Johnson looked to have sealed victory when he scored in the 76th minute. But George Ford crossed at the death to complete a remarkable draw.
Care: This for me was a crazy Six Nations game. For entertainment value, this is a 10 out of 10. Those moments when you need an ice-cool player - George Ford was the man. I don't think we'll see a game like that again.

sports	England-Wales World Cup bid could 'transform' hockey	"An ambitious plan for England and Wales to host the biggest hockey World Cup yet could help transform the sport, according to Wales captain Rupert Shipperley.
wo nations have submitted a joint bid to host the men's World Cup in 2026 across four venues - with the final matches being played at Tottenham Hotspur's 62,000-seater stadium.
revious men's World Cup held in the UK was in London back in 1986.
International Hockey Federation (FIH) will announce the host, or hosts, in November - with Germany and South Africa among the rival bidders.
""It's a bit nerve-wracking to think we could be playing in front of 62,000 people,"" Shipperley told BBC Sport Wales at an event at the Tottenham stadium.
""This is the biggest stadium I've ever been to - as player but also as a fan of any sport. So it'd be massive for the sport and a new experience for hockey.
""If you'd had said ten years ago I'd be stood here saying potentially in a couple of years we could be playing on this pitch, I'd have laughed at you. There's a real opportunity to transform the game of hockey on the international stage.""
matches of the 16-team event will be played at Cardiff Arms Park, Twickenham Stoop in London and Franklin's Gardens in Northampton.
It would be the first time Wales has hosted World Cup fixtures. Its national sides have only been to one World Cup before - the women's event in Malaysia in 1983.
men's side have qualified for their first World Cup in India in January.
""It's nice to see the recognition we're getting,"" said goalkeeper Toby Reynolds-Cotterill, whose shoot-out saves were instrumental in Wales' qualification for the 2023 event.
""We've had quite a journey over the last eight years. Now qualifying for the World Cup in January and hopefully going to the next one [in 2026], it's nice to see the recognition of us and a federation.
""Hopefully we can get some very good crowds, especially if we're playing in Cardiff. The support we'd get would be unreal.""
England Hockey chief executive Nick Pink said the bid team wanted to go 'bold' with the event.
""It's about putting hockey into new environments,"" he said.
""It'd be absolutely incredible to have 62,000 people watching here [in Tottenham]. It's about that transformation and pushing the sport into a different realm.
""But the second part is the legacy and the social impact. We always wanted this to be a project that took the sport right across the UK.
""Taking it right into the heart of a major city like Cardiff is just fantastic for us. It's about getting Welsh fans and Welsh communities excited about the sport of hockey. They see it in rugby and other major sports - but they've not seen hockey in that space before.
""That for me is the drive to try to engage new communities, new audiences and sustain our sport for future generations."""	/sport/hockey/62987093
health	Londonderry: Future of Shantallow GP practice in doubt	"A Londonderry GP practice is at risk of closure after it handed its contract back to the Department of Health.
rtment said it was working to ensure an alternative service is put in place for the patients who attend the Racecourse Medical Group practice.
It confirmed that the department would retain the contract to deliver services for the next six months.
A recruitment process would now begin to put other arrangements in place, the department have said.
""Patients at the practice do not need to take any action,"" the department told BBC Radio Foyle. 
It will now be writing to all practice patients in the Shantallow practice to keep them informed as the process begins.
It is understood GPs at the Racecourse Road practice in Shantallow have decided to hand the contract to the strategic planning and performance group (SPPG) ahead of the retirement of a partner.
""The news that the management of the Racecourse Medical Group have handed back the contract is causing extreme concern for people in this area,"" Social Democratic and Labour Party councillor Brian Tierney said. 
""People have built relationships with the staff who provide an excellent standard of care and people in this community would be devastated to see it close.
""While the surgery will continue to operate as normal for at least the next six months, we need to see urgent action from the Department of Health to find new management so that it can continue to provide services to people in this area.""
move comes as one of Northern Ireland's largest GP practices, Maple Healthcare in Lisnaskea, County Fermanagh, is at risk of closure after its operator handed its contract back to the department.
On Friday, two surgeries in Ballymena also indicated that they intended to resign affecting about 7,000 patients.
""It is very worrying when we hear it in specific areas, it's worrying when we hear it happening right across Northern Ireland,"" the British Medical Association (BMA) said.
Dr Alan Stout from the organisation said more and more practices were ""really struggling to cope, struggling to keep doors open, struggling to pay staff and also struggling to keep up with demand"".
""We are hearing far too frequently from all areas that practices are simply saying that they can't deal with it anymore and are handing back their contracts,"" he added. 
Dr Stout said as soon as a GP practice handed its contract back the ""clock starts ticking"".
""In most cases it will be six months until a contract is actually advertised after it has been handed back,"" he said.
""Everybody will then try their best to get a new contractor, like a new GP, or it might be an agreement with other practices... or worst case scenario patients will then be allocated to other practices.""
Across Northern Ireland, the number of GP practices has fallen by just under 9% in eight years according to Department of Health Figures.
Belfast - Flax Medical Centre, Belfast, County Antrim
Northern - Ballymena Family Practice, Ballymena, County Antrim
South Eastern - Priory Surgery, Holywood, County Down
Western, Maple Healthcare Practice, Lisnaskea, Co Fermanagh.
Despite the decrease in practices, the number of GPs, excluding locums, has gone up by 20% to 1,419 since 2014."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63818929
entertainment	Lizzo plays 200-year-old flute owned by former US president	"US star Lizzo wowed fans during a concert on Tuesday in Washington DC when she took to the stage to play a 200-year-old crystal flute, once owned by former US President James Madison.
ger and trained flautist was granted permission by The Library of Congress to play the instrument, which arrived on stage with a police escort.
Inspecting it on stage, she said: ""It's like playing out of a wine glass.""
She then played a few notes while simultaneously shaking her lower body.
""I just twerked and played James Madison's flute from the 1800s!"" she beamed, after having handed it back to a representative who put it back in its case.
While posting the video on her own social media channels afterwards, the Houston-raised Juice singer told her fans: ""No one has ever heard what is sounds like... now you do.""
She later added: ""As a flute player this is iconic and I will never be over it."" 
A spokesperson for the Library of Congress told the BBC that the flute may have been played in public on a rare special occasion in the past, most likely in Madison's time.
Until Lizzo picked up the flute, the Library's curator, who has worked at the Library since 1993, had never heard it played live.
Following her historic gig on Tuesday evening, The Library of Congress tweeted to confirm the flute had been returned safely.
""We just did a DNA test,"" they posted. ""Turns out: It's 100% that [crystal] flute"" - a play on words with the lyrics from Lizzo's hit song Truth Hurts.
Grammy-winner Lizzo is currently touring the US in support of her fourth album, Special, which featured the TikTok hit, About Damn Time.
Earlier this summer, she changed the lyrics to a new song, Grrrls, after fans complained it used an ableist slur.
James Madison, America's fourth President from 1809 to 1817, made a major contribution to the ratification of the Constitution by writing The Federalist Papers, along with Alexander Hamilton and John Jay. In later years, he was referred to as the Father of the Constitution."	/news/entertainment-arts-63058818
technology	NHS IT supplier held to ransom by hackers	"A cyber-attack on a major IT provider of the NHS has been confirmed as a ransomware attack.
Advanced, which provides digital services like patient check-in and NHS 111, says it may take three to four weeks to fully recover.
Ransomware hackers take control of IT systems, steal data and demand a payment from victims to recover.
NHS insists that disruption is minimal, but Advanced would not say whether NHS data had been stolen.
Birmingham-based firm says it first spotted the hack at 07:00 BST on 4 August and immediately took steps to contain the hackers. It is now working to restore services.
mpany refused to say if it was in negotiations with hackers or paying a ransom to them. 
In a statement, it said: ""We are rebuilding and restoring impacted systems in a separate and secure environment.""
Watch: What is ransomware and how does it work?
An NHS England spokesperson said: ""While Advanced has confirmed that the incident impacting their software is ransomware, the NHS has tried and tested contingency plans in place including robust defences to protect our own networks, as we work with the National Cyber Security Centre to fully understand the impact. 
""The public should continue to use NHS services as normal, including NHS 111 for those who are unwell, although some people will face longer waits than usual.
""As ever, if it is an emergency, please call 999.""
An NHS psychiatrist, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC the attack left his team ""making clinical decisions nearly blind"".
""If a new patient came to us, we weren't able to read their history or know very much about them,"" he said.
""The [local] trust are doing their best at setting up an alternative system, they've got a way that we can look at some historical notes now, and have set up another system to mean that we can input new notes.
""But there's still basically a week's worth of notes that we can't access. We've been told to be ready for it to not be up and running for who knows how long.""
At the end of last week, family doctors in London were warned by NHS England they could see an increased number of patients sent to them by NHS 111 because of the ""significant technical issue"", industry magazine Pulse reported.
Advanced initially said that only a ""small number of servers"" had been affected and that it might be able to recover in a week.
Products which have been affected include Adastra, which is used by NHS 111 service, and Caresys and Carenotes, which provide the backbone for care home services like patient notes and visitor booking. 
National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ, says it is working with Advanced to help it recover.
A spokesman said: ""Ransomware is the key cyber-threat facing the UK, and all organisations should take immediate steps to limit risk by following our advice on how to put in place robust defences to protect their networks.""
Ransomware hackers are usually financially motivated and part of large, professionally run criminal gangs that target companies and demand hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions, of pounds in ransom in the form of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
While it is hard to trace where the gangs are based, analysis suggests that 74% of all money made through ransomware attacks in 2021 went to Russia-linked hackers."	/news/technology-62506039
business	Train drivers set to resume strikes in October	"rain drivers are set to stage more strikes in October as part of a long-running dispute over pay, the BBC understands.
Drivers at 12 train companies are expected to strike on 1 and 5 October.
Aslef, the train drivers' union, has not commented on the proposed industrial action out of respect ahead of Queen Elizabeth II's funeral.
A strike had been planned for 15 September, but was postponed following the announcement of the Queen's death. 
Aslef will not be making any public statements or comments on further strike action until Tuesday. 
But the managing director of rail operator LNER, David Horne, tweeted that the trade union Aslef had indeed notified it of strike action on Saturday 1 October and Wednesday 5 October.
Mr Horne said LNER had already suspended ticket sales for these dates and it would confirm as soon as possible which services will be running.
A rail industry source told the BBC that they found it ""incredible"" and ""utterly disrespectful"" that the Aslef leadership announced fresh strike action on Friday.
""This a time when the entire rail family is working hard to support the hundreds of thousands of people who wish to pay their respects to Her Majesty the Queen during this time of national mourning,"" they said.
A series of large-scale rail strikes has already happened in recent months, causing disruption for millions, with unions wanting pay increases in line with the rising cost of living.
Rail bosses say they want to give workers a pay rise. But they and the government insist changes are needed to ""modernise"" the railway, end some outdated working practices and save money.

politics	Londoners could vote for two more MPs at an election	"Londoners could vote for more MPs at the next general election as part of constituency boundary changes. 
Boundary Commission for England has published its final revised proposals to be finalised by 2023.
How the boundaries are set can be controversial as moving the borders can bring in voters who are in favour of different political parties.
Electoral boundaries, which divide parliamentary constituencies, change every five years. 
re revised to stay in keeping with population changes, so that MPs represent roughly the same number of voters each.
Under the current proposed revision in London, Labour would have potentially won an extra three seats in the 2019 general election.
But across the country, the Conservative Party would have won five more seats.
If the new boundaries are in place in time for the next general election, which has to take place in 2025 at the latest, the number of MPs in London would increase by two, with 75 constituencies in total.
Conservatives could gain support in former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Uxbridge & South Ruislip constituency as it would include some new areas that are more Tory leaning.
ry MP Iain Duncan Smith could be at a disadvantage in Chingford & Woodford Green, where the new boundaries would take in more of Redbridge and become, in theory, more Labour leaning.
Some constituencies would no longer exist at all, like Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey's Kingston & Surbiton seat, because Kingston town centre would be absorbed into Richmond Park, which is held by his fellow Lib Dem MP Sarah Olney. 
Sir Ed has said he would contest the newly created Surbiton & the Maldens seat.
As for Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, his Holborn & St Pancras seat would remain largely unchanged. 
And shadow health secretary Wes Streeting would see moderate changes to the borders of his Ilford North seat, but they would be unlikely to make much difference politically.
ublic can have their say until 5 December on the Boundary Commission for England's third and final consultation on the new electoral map, with the final recommendations expected to be submitted to Parliament in July.

business	Low-deposit mortgage scheme extended for a year	"A mortgage guarantee scheme to help people get on the property ladder is to be extended by a year.
government said the programme, which was due to close at the end of December, would help buyers ""navigate difficult times"".
It was originally designed to encourage lenders to give home loans to people offering a 5% deposit - a product that was far less available during Covid.
Some lenders still play it safe as buyers face the rising cost of living.
Chief Secretary to the Treasury John Glen said: ""For hard-working families facing today's challenging economic conditions, it is right that we continue to help them secure their first home or move into their dream house.
""Extending this scheme means thousands more have the chance to benefit, and supports the market as we navigate through these difficult times.""
mortgage scheme has a £600,000 limit, and is primarily used to help first-time buyers.
95% loan-to-value mortgages are often seen as riskier by banks as they are more vulnerable to falling property prices, when there is a risk that people hold more debt than their home is worth.
Under the scheme, the government takes on some of the risk and compensates the lender for some of the loan if the property is repossessed.
It began in April last year, and the government said it had helped more than 24,000 households.
Some brokers have suggested the scheme had done its job by bringing more low-deposit mortgages onto the market, but others suggested only a small number of lenders had used the scheme.
Many mortgage providers generally only lend to those with a regular income, irrespective of any government incentive, and still carry out affordability checks.
Unemployment levels are expected to rise and the UK housing market is expected to slow. 
A recent survey by the Building Societies Association, suggested that 14% of people thought now was a good time to buy a property, but 47% did not think now was a good time to purchase a home."	/news/business-64031563

technology	The social media lifeline amid soaring food costs	"Every morning, Tina Harrison logs on to the Facebook page for Trinity Foodbank in Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, to check for new messages. As the cost of living crisis deepens, more and more people, she says, have been getting in touch to say they've run out of food and need help.
Mrs Harrison, a former nurse - or one of her fellow volunteers - will reply. They try to offer some form of assistance to everybody. 
Many people ask permission: is it OK to come and receive a food parcel? ""It's always, 'Yes, it's OK,'"" says Mrs Harrison. Before the pandemic, the food bank handed out around 20 parcels per week. That figure has nearly quadrupled in more recent times. 
""It's just going to get worse, I think,"" says Mrs Harrison, describing how some parents have told her that they sit in bed with their children to watch TV on some evenings, just to keep warm.
rising cost of food and energy is affecting people from all walks of life, she adds, from single people to families. But households with children could find the summer months particularly difficult. 
While many local authorities are launching holiday meal voucher or cash payment schemes, some children won't have as easy access to food during the day as they would when in school. During the pandemic, the government U-turned on its previous policy of not providing free school meals to children in England over the holidays.
But teaching unions have argued recently that the offer of these meals ought to be extended due to the cost of living crisis.
financial hardship facing many families is prompting more of them to approach their local food bank or community support network, perhaps for the first time. Many are making that initial contact via Facebook or other social media sites.
rinity Foodbank doesn't just offer food, Mrs Harrison stresses. There's friendly help and advice about how to budget and how to claim grants or benefits. 
Independent Food Aid Network (Ifan), which connects hundreds of food aid providers, has produced leaflets with financial advice for people in need. There are interactive versions online, as well.
""When you've got a problem as widespread as this, you just come up with as many ways as possible of reaching people,"" says Sabine Goodwin, Ifan co-ordinator.
Food banks are also using social media to advertise for donations because they have noticed a drop in such support lately. ""They're running out of food a lot of the time,"" says Ms Goodwin. This is because people who would usually support their local food bank have also been hit by spiralling costs.
""Nearly everyone is on social media now,"" says Mark Wells, founder of the Food Facts Friends food bank in Midlothian. He describes how he has used Facebook lately to post pictures of relatively bare shelves in the food bank store, in an effort to inspire donations.
""I've just set up an account with TikTok,"" he says, referring to the video-sharing site. Mr Wells hopes that young people will find videos of the food bank's fare and show their parents so that people know what's available, should they need it.
rt of content can help connect people to food aid providers in their area, says Brooke Bennett at the University of Connecticut's Rudd Center for Food Policy & Health. 
In a recent study, she and colleagues asked summer meal providers how they signposted their services to families in Connecticut. They reported higher online engagement, and more in-person visitors, when they posted photos of whatever food would be available on a particular day.  
Some providers pay a small fee to promote these posts as well. ""You can really target an audience that you know is in your zip code, your area,"" says Dr Bennett.
In 2020, the Food Foundation, a UK charity, and marketing agency PLMR launched a map to signpost the locations of businesses offering free meals to children during the October half-term holiday, when free school meals weren't available. 
Around 50,000 users visited the map during that time. Given the government U-turn on holiday meals, there are no plans to relaunch this map, the Foundation says. 
However, there are other, localised tools that make it easy for people to find out what help is available near to them, such as the interactive Google Map maintained by Feeding Liverpool. It shows the locations of food clubs and community shops around the city. 
""It's one of the best things we've done,"" says Naomi Maynard, good food programme director. ""It's so simple but just giving people the knowledge of what's in their local area is so empowering.""
Users are able to search for providers that cater for dietary requirements, such as vegetarian, gluten-free, kosher or halal, she notes.
Digital platforms are not panaceas for food insecurity, notes Georgiana Nica-Avram at Nottingham University Business School. However, such services can help people to access support in a dignified way.
""Not many people may want to publicly acknowledge that they are going through this themselves or they may not have an extensive network of support,"" she explains.
In partnership with the food-sharing app Olio, Dr Nica-Avram and colleagues have studied how some people use Olio to support themselves during times of severe hardship.
Sadly, there is no doubt that the coming months will prove very difficult for lots of families. Many parents who stop by Trinity Foodbank in Radcliffe also mention their concerns about the coming winter, and the high heating costs they expect then, notes Mrs Harrison. 
More technology of business:
A Department for Education spokeswoman says the government recognises that millions of households are struggling with rising prices. 
""The Holiday Activities and Food programme runs during major school holidays,"" she adds.
""Wider welfare support is available for families through the Household Support Fund, which helps vulnerable families in need with essentials, such as food and utility bills."" A total of £37bn of public money is currently available to support households during the cost of living crisis.
Mrs Harrison and her fellow volunteers are determined to keep providing whatever help they can, despite the pressure also facing those who normally donate to the food bank.
""I think at the moment we're just riding with the times, a bit like we did with Covid, really,"" she says."	/news/business-62034982
technology	US midterms: How BBC's voter profiles were shown hate and disinformation online	"Disinformation and Social Media correspondent Marianna Spring set up a series of social media accounts to investigate what voters are being recommended online at a turbulent time for US politics. After over two months of running the profiles, this is what she found. 
I open up Britney's Instagram and click on an account that's been recommended in her feed. I'm greeted by a meme falsely declaring that President Joe Biden never really won the 2020 election, and several others targeting named female politicians with misogynistic comments and abusive language. 
Britney is one of five profiles I've created to track what US voters can be recommended and exposed to online ahead of the midterm elections. While social media sites say they are committed to tackling disinformation and hate on their platforms ahead of the poll, for my undercover voters, misleading and violent posts appear to have only increased in recent weeks. 
My five voters were created to represent views from across the US political spectrum, based on data gathered by the Pew Research Centre. I gave each of them a profile on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube and Twitter, with names and computer-generated photos.  
re: 
For all of them, I followed additional accounts when they were suggested, as well as keeping up their original interests. 
While these profiles can't offer an exhaustive insight into what every US voter could be seeing - and they don't have friends or followers - they do give us a snapshot of what voters across the political spectrum are being exposed to. 
Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), which tracks extremism and disinformation worldwide, says that election conspiracy claims and abusive language aimed at politicians online have intensified in the run-up to the midterms.
As I've checked into each of my undercover voters' accounts over the past two months, it's Britney's that have been most frequently exposed to violent and misleading content.  
When setting up her account, I liked pages and accounts that supported Mr Trump, opposed mandatory vaccination and questioned the motives of billionaires. These topics appear to have been a gateway to more extreme content, when compared with the other undercover voters. 
Larry was exposed to posts featuring misleading claims about the 2020 election and abusive language directed at politicians, while Emma was also recommended several pages using abusive language aimed at supporters of Donald Trump and Supreme Court Justices, but nothing on the scale of what Britney was recommended. 
When I logged onto Instagram in particular, I found she was recommended more and more accounts that made false claims about fraudulent voting and denied that President Biden won the election. 
regularly featured hashtags like #Trumpwon in their profile descriptions and on their posts, and shared memes about the riots on the Capitol claiming that ""January 6th wasn't an insurrection"".
Britney's profile was also shown TikTok videos from accounts promoting conspiracy theories that the election was rigged, also repeating the phrase ""Trump Won"". 
Last week, Instagram showed her conspiracy theories contradicting the police account of what happened when Paul Pelosi, the husband of US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was violently attacked in their home. Posts also made light of the violence. 
Finally, pages recommended to Britney's Instagram account also featured posts talking about female politicians in abusive and misogynistic terms. 
most frequent targets were Nancy Pelosi, Kamala Harris, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton. There were comments about them performing sex acts, and slurs about their appearances, alongside criticism of their politics. While posts often spoke about Joe Biden and Donald Trump in hateful terms, they were not subject to the same sexualised language.
guage was unique to Britney's accounts. On Facebook, Emma was recommended pages that promoted naming and shaming racists and Trump supporters, but the rhetoric had not escalated in the same way. 
Gabriela was increasingly recommended right-leaning content on social media, often about inflation and the cost of living crisis, but it stopped short of the more extreme disinformation and hate that Britney encountered. 
Larry and Michael were targeted more frequently by official campaign adverts and content from the political parties themselves, especially on sites like YouTube. For Larry, the messaging was focused on crime, inflation and immigration. For Michael, the adverts and posts talked about abortion, climate change and education.
As well as noting the uptick in hate ahead of the midterms, the Institute for Strategic Dialogue says disinformation online has focused on conspiracies about the Biden administration, as well as the issue of voting in specific US states. 
""That, when combined with social media product features and failed policies, is giving permission to more hate and vitriol,"" said Jiore Craig, the ISD's Head of Elections and Digital Integrity.
In particular, the ISD found election conspiracy theories in short-form video formats across several platforms. Social media companies have ""inconsistent and insufficient moderation policies"" to deal with this kind of content, its research concludes. 
research also expresses concerns that the major social media companies are not taking election denials seriously, although they have made various commitments to tackling disinformation and hate ahead of the midterms.
In August, Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - said it would devote ""hundreds of people across more than 40 teams"" to ensure the security and safety of the midterms, and apply ""learnings"" from the past election. 
Meta told the BBC that it has robust measures in place to combat misinformation, including partnerships with 10 fact-checking organisations in the US.
It also said it has ""clear policies about what is and isn't allowed on our platforms"" and ""continually reviews content"" to see if it violates policies. 
kTok also announced its own ""commitment to election integrity"" ahead of the vote, saying it had partnered with fact-checking organisations. It told the BBC it took its ""responsibility to protect the integrity of our platform and elections with utmost seriousness"".
Populist Right Britney, Progressive Left Emma and even Apolitical Gabriela have been recommended increasingly polarised content on Twitter over the past two months, particularly on immigration, crime and climate change. 
Britney's account was also shown a conspiracy theory shared by Elon Musk about the attack on Mr Pelosi - Mr Musk later deleted his tweet. 
re are concerns that lay-offs and potential changes to moderation policies on Twitter, which Mr Musk now owns, could also lead to an increase in online disinformation just before voters head to the polls.
Several of the Instagram accounts that Britney has been recommended promoting claims that Trump really won the 2020 election have also praised Mr Musk for buying Twitter and referenced their plans to return to the site. 
witter says that while it has lost employees, their ""core moderation capabilities remain in place""."	/news/world-us-canada-63530374
politics	Is Nicola Sturgeon losing her grip on the SNP?	"f Stephen Flynn as the SNP's Westminster leader has been portrayed by other parties as a blow for the authority of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.
Mr Flynn is replacing a close ally of Ms Sturgeon in Ian Blackford, and won a contest against another in Alison Thewliss.
But with the two politicians insisting they will work together towards their shared goal of Scottish independence, has talk of divisions within Scotland's most dominant political force been overstated?
SNP has been quick to dismiss any notion of schisms within the party as ""complete fiction"".
Ms Sturgeon swiftly congratulated Mr Flynn and his deputy Mhairi Black as a ""truly formidable team"", saying she was ""looking forward to working with them both"".
She has also insisted that the move to replace Mr Blackford was ""not a coup"" - but it is a fact that Mr Flynn's name was being linked with moves to replace the Ross, Skye and Lochaber MP in the weeks before he decided to step down.
Mr Flynn initially denied he was planning a leadership bid despite talk of him being ""on manoeuvres"". 
But the Aberdeen South MP has since conceded that something was going on, stating that ""it's not unusual in political parties for people to court the support or opinion of their colleagues"".
me off the back of months of speculation about whether there could be a change, which was so widespread that Boris Johnson used to poke fun at Mr Blackford about it on a weekly basis at prime minister's questions.
Mr Flynn was floated as an alternative who might prove a punchier figure, who would have more of a go at the Westminster establishment - and perhaps, whispered some, the SNP's internal one.
After Mr Blackford announced his departure, Mr Flynn hoped for a coronation - one ally told BBC Scotland they would be ""astonished"" if anyone else ran for the job - and it is understood that the 34-year-old met Ms Sturgeon for talks.
However those hopes were dashed when Alison Thewliss - a Glasgow MP widely seen as being much closer to the first minister - announced she would be running. 
Ms Thewliss stressed her credentials as a ""team player"", saying she would ""work closer and smarter"" with the Scottish government, and ultimately won the backing of 17 MPs to Mr Flynn's 26.
So it may be the case that recent events have not played out in exactly the way either Mr Flynn or Ms Sturgeon might have wanted.
But now that Mr Flynn is in the post, both will be looking forward - because the role of the SNP's Westminster group might be about to become more important than ever before.
Stephen Flynn takes part in his first Prime Minister's Questions
With plans for an independence referendum next year having hit the buffers, the party is looking to use the next general election as a single-issue campaign.
means the constitutional question could be answered not by people voting Yes or No, but by putting a cross in a box next to the name of someone like Stephen Flynn or Alison Thewliss.
MPs like John McNally and Marion Fellows may not have garnered a huge profile in politics to date, but they are going to be on the frontline of what their party hopes will be the decisive contest in its independence campaign.
re have been some rumblings about the strategy already, with high profile MP Angus MacNeil suggesting that a snap Holyrood election might be better suited as a ""de facto referendum"" than a general election would be.
And Ms Black and Stewart McDonald have both sought to talk down some of the rhetoric which flew around about Scotland being ""oppressed"" or a ""colony"" in the wake of November's Supreme Court ruling.
So the key question about Mr Flynn's regime is whether he can pull his group together and get them marching in unison ahead of the next election, which is currently expected in 2024.
Westminster group has always been slightly more restive, being further from Ms Sturgeon's control and lacking a clear purpose as the third party in a parliament all of its members would like to leave.
But there have been rumblings of discontent in the first minister's back yard at Holyrood too.
In October, the SNP suffered its largest ever backbench rebellion over the government's plans to make it easier for people to change their legally recognised gender. 
One minister resigned to vote against the plans, and eight other MSPs broke the whip - accounting for 20% of the party's backbench group.
ue back in parliament in the days before the Christmas break, and there will be a series of further votes on amendments before the big vote whether the bill becomes law.
It is still expected to pass, and ministers hope this will put the issue to bed at least from a parliamentary standpoint.
And it is fair to say that there are not many other issues like gender reform coming up at Holyrood on which SNP members would be likely to rebel en masse.
But there has been criticism on some other fronts too, with SNP members of Holyrood's finance committee hitting out about the lack of detail in financial plans for the National Care Service.
me committee is set to hold an inquiry into ""effective decision-making by government"". 
It's possible this could signal an outbreak of independent thinking from MSPs in a parliament where party whips have been utterly dominant.
Does all of this add up to a real headache for Ms Sturgeon?
It may be more the case that these grumbles are side-effects of the greater question facing the independence movement, as its strategy begins to pivot away from holding a referendum next year.
For the entirety of Ms Sturgeon's record-breaking tenure as first minister, the plan has been to secure and win a referendum.
She has repeatedly predicted that Westminster opposition to indyref2 would prove unsustainable, and would crumble in the face of one more electoral mandate. It has not.
And having pushed a case to the Supreme Court and lost, the SNP leader is now drawing up plans for a de facto referendum - an approach she previously used to write off as a ""unionist trap"" when proposed by opponents within the SNP.
re are a great many questions to be answered about how a de facto referendum would work, and whether it could actually deliver independence with international recognition. 
It may be that this uncertainty is what has sparked questions about Ms Sturgeon's grip on her party too.
She will hold a special party conference in the new year in a bid to settle the issue of process - and if she can do that, it's entirely possibly she will put the wider questions about her authority to bed too.
If the independence movement and its political representatives are focused on the greater prize and feel it is truly close at hand, they will frankly have less time to spend on infighting.
And unlike at Westminster, there does not appear to be any particular challenge to Ms Sturgeon's leadership from ambitious colleagues.
Not only is nobody plotting a move against the first minister, the leadership doesn't seem to have any succession plans of its own in the pipeline. 
re are few obvious signs of a future first minister being groomed within the ministerial team.
So in the next phase of the debate, Ms Sturgeon's position is still assured. But given she is hoping the coming years will answer the constitutional question once and for all, this period will likely prove decisive in terms of her own future too."	/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-63886994

technology	Meta, Amazon, Twitter layoffs: 'Tech layoffs won't destroy American dreams of Indians’	"Many Indians who work on temporary visas in the US are facing an uncertain future after mass layoffs at big tech firms. Surbhi Gupta, who lost her job at Meta, tells her story of in her own words.
It was my mum's birthday. I was staying up late to wish her and that's when I started getting messages from my friends about layoff announcements. They were all anxious.
At around 6am here, I received an email that I'd been let go. I had joined Meta earlier this year as a product manager. My team was shocked because I'd been performing really well.
It went against my motto, work is worship, instilled early by my favourite teacher at school. Initially, it felt like the Titanic sinking because I was losing access to things one by one - workplace, then email, then laptop. But I was pleasantly overwhelmed and surprised in a positive way by my network on LinkedIn. Many colleagues, ex-colleagues and friends reached out in a very supportive way, making introductions and referrals. It made me feel like I have so many people in this country who care for me, made me feel like I belong to this country.
My last day at Meta is in January and my H1-B visa [a non-immigrant visa that allows firms in the US to hire foreigners for up to six years] allows me to stay in the US for another 60 days, so early March is the deadline for me to find another job. 
job search is going to be difficult now as hiring will be slow in December because of the holidays. But I'm very focused. I am in touch with multiple companies and exploring options.
What I'll miss most about Meta is the workplace and my colleagues. Being at Meta meant not only being able to build an amazing product for millions of people, but also being able to participate in fireside chats and growth and learning opportunities. As a product manager, it would have been rewarding to see the project I was working on go further.
My parents taught me to never give up in life. They tell me to stay strong because I'm a person who can convert problems into opportunities. They tell me 'aur kuch accha mil jayega' [you'll find something better].
But my ability to work and stay in the US depends on my H1-B visa. I moved to the US in 2009 and I have worked very hard to build my career on my own strength and intellect. I have worked in prominent companies like Tesla, Intuit, etc., built great products, got top ratings, paid taxes, and contributed to the US economy for more than 15 years, but I feel that I am in the same place as far as permanent residency goes because of the limitations of the H1-B. I was crowned Miss Bharat California [a beauty pageant] by my idol, Bollywood actress Sushmita Sen. I have walked the ramp at New York Fashion Week. I have my own podcast. 
We face unnecessary stress because the US has a country cap which takes forever for Indian H1-B holders to get a green card (permanent residency). Even though I am in the green card queue, when I track my status, I sometimes get a wait-time of two decades, and at other times, 60 years.
Our personal life suffers because of the uncertainty. Buying a home has been a question mark in my mind - do I invest in a home and then what if I have to leave. In spite of having gone ahead with the YC [Y Combinator is an American technology start-up accelerator], I can't start a company even though I have a great idea because I don't have a green card.
I travelled to 30 countries before turning 30 years old, but now I'm unable to travel much, even though it's my dream to travel the world, because I'm nervous about facing problems while trying to get my H1-B visa re-stamped. I have heard from my friends who work at great companies like Google and PayPal about getting stuck abroad.
I have even curtailed my travels home to India. A few years back, I got stuck in India. I had gone to attend a wedding and I had to get my H1-B visa stamped. But that took several months as it went into random administrative processing and I wasn't even sure when it would come through. The uncertainty and the wait caused problems in my marriage. The visa issues had a very big role in my marriage. It was not the only reason, but it became one of the major reasons for the break-up of my marriage. I also had to drop out of a semester at New York University, where I was studying at the time, because I didn't know when I would be able to return to the US. Why do people on H1-Bs have to deal with this?
I have not met my parents since the Covid-19 pandemic because they haven't been able to come to visit me for three-and-a-half years. They are elderly, and don't keep too well. I constantly think - if my parents need support, will I be able to go to help them? Nobody realises how it impacts our life.
But despite whatever has happened, I believe this experience too has a silver lining. Spirituality is a significant part of my life. I am a believer and follower of Sadhguru ji [as followers refer to Indian yoga guru Jaggi Vasudev]. He says that we should not be identified only by or limit our identity to our professional role. In Silicon Valley, the most frequently asked question is - Which company do you work for? But I am still me, not just a product manager. Everyone should realise that they are more than just the company they work for.

technology	Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes jailed for fraud	"ranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has been sentenced to over 11 years in prison for defrauding investors in her blood testing start-up that was once valued at $9bn (£7.5bn).
former Silicon Valley star falsely claimed the technology could diagnose disease with just a few drops of blood. 
Holmes, 38, who is pregnant, tearfully told the court she felt ""deep pain"" for those misled by the scam.
She was found guilty in January after a three-month trial.
Holmes is expected to appeal against the sentence, which was handed down on Friday in a California court. 
Once hailed as the ""next Steve Jobs"", she was at one time said to be the world's youngest self-made billionaire.
She launched Theranos after dropping out of Stanford University at age 19, and its value rose sharply after the company claimed it could bring about a revolution in disease diagnosis.
But the technology Holmes touted did not work and - awash in lawsuits - the company was dissolved by 2018.
At Holmes' trial in San Jose, California, prosecutors said she knowingly misled doctors and patients about Theranos' flagship product - the Edison machine - which the company claimed could detect cancer, diabetes and other conditions using just a few drops of blood.
used Holmes of vastly exaggerating the firm's performance to its financial backers.
Jurors ultimately found her guilty on four counts of fraud, with a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. But they found her not guilty on four other charges, and failed to reach a verdict on three more.
Before Judge Edward Davila issued his sentence on Friday, Holmes read a speech to the court in which she tearfully apologised to investors and patients.
rise and fall of Elizabeth Holmes
""I am devastated by my failings. I have felt deep pain for what people went through, because I failed them,"" she said. 
""I regret my failings with every cell of my body,"" she continued. 
judge referred to Holmes as a ""brilliant"" entrepreneur, and told her: ""Failure is normal. But failure by fraud is not OK."" 
Silicon Valley is a place where fortunes can be made and squandered. It's not unusual for investors to lose big sums of money. 
It's also not unusual for founders to make grandiose claims about their tech. 
What is different about Holmes' case, though, is that Theranos' unwinding actually led to fraud charges that stuck. 
It is notoriously difficult to get successful prosecutions in cases of white-collar fraud in the US. 
When investors lose money, they often simply write it off, or pursue compensation privately. 
Holmes' punishment is a warning for Silicon Valley executives that there are real consequences for misleading investors.  
't a slap on the wrist, it's significant time in prison. 
She is required to surrender to begin serving her sentence on 27 April. 
Holmes and Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani, her former business partner and lover, were charged in 2018 with wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Balwani, who was tried separately, was found guilty of fraud this summer. He will be sentenced next month.
Prosecutors requested that she face 15 years in prison and pay some $800m in restitution to investors, including several high-profile figures such as former US Secretary of Defense James Mattis, who testified against her at the trial, and software tycoon Larry Ellison. 
But Holmes' defence team - who argued she was well-intentioned and trying to help people - said she should spend 18 months under house arrest.
judge on Friday determined that she had caused $121m in losses to investors, including Rupert Murdoch and the family that owns Walmart. The amount she will be required to repay will be determined at a later court hearing. 
Over 130 friends, family and former Theranos employees wrote to the judge to appeal for clemency.
group noted that Holmes is a young mother. She had a son in July 2021 and is currently pregnant with her second child. 
It is not known when she is due to give birth. Her lawyers are expected to try to keep her from entering prison until after the baby is born. 
Her partner Billy Evans, in his sentencing memo to the court, told the judge that he fears for ""a future in which my son grows up with a relationship with his mother on the other side of glass armed by guards"".
Eileen Lepera, a Silicon Valley secretary who lost a chunk of her life savings by investing in Theranos, told the BBC she was ""happy"" with the sentence.
""I think it's fair, considering all the facts of the case,"" Ms Lepera said. ""She [Holmes] knew it was fraud, and she put people's lives at risk."""	/news/world-us-canada-63685131
entertainment	The birth pangs of the Grand Theft Auto franchise	"Grand Theft Auto franchise has been a phenomenal success since it was first launched exactly 25 years ago, making billions of dollars for its American owner Take-Two Interactive.
So it may come as a surprise to learn that its creators, Dundee-based DMA Design, were far from confident about GTA's prospects as they struggled with creative and technical problems during its development in the 1990s.
Colin Macdonald, who joined DMA a few months before the launch of the action-adventure video game in 1997, explains: ""In mid-development, there was an informal staff survey on which of the seven titles they were working on would be the most successful and least successful. 
""The one voted most likely not to succeed was Grand Theft Auto.
""That's because, mid-development, the direction of the game wasn't clear. It was also quite buggy - you couldn't play it for more than a couple of minutes without it crashing, so certainly at grassroots level there wasn't a lot of confidence in it."" 
Colin, who was to become the producer of GTA 2 and later Channel 4's first games commissioning editor, says the atmosphere at DMA was ""quite relaxed"" by the time he joined.
""GTA went through a lot of different iterations and was quite a troubled development, and wasn't really regarded well for most of the time it was in production.
""By the time I joined it was pretty much done and the team was actually quite happy because they had kind of got shot of it.
""They were looking forward to sitting back, planning a sequel properly, redoing the things that they weren't happy with, and just looking forward to getting stuck into iterating on it and seeing where else they could take it.""
Fans of GTA may also be surprised to learn that the franchise actually stemmed from a technology experiment - with a dinosaur as its central character.
Colin explains: ""One of the original founding programmers at DMA, Mike Dailly, was basically doing a tech experiment as a way of showing how buildings could look in 3D from top down with a little bit of perspective.
""So he basically came up with a dinosaur game. You had this city that moved around in some form of 3D, but you were a dinosaur roaming around and destroying the buildings. That was what Grand Theft Auto started as.
""He then added in little cars driving around, just to bring the city to life. 
""Someone had the bright idea to see what it would be like driving one of the cars rather than controlling the dinosaur and suddenly it changed into a car game, rather than a dinosaur game. 
""It was called Race 'n' Chase for a good while. And then someone realised, 'oh, actually we'll try letting the player get out of the car and run around and jump in and out of other cars'. 
""It was really only at that point it morphed into Grand Theft Auto."" 
Overhauling the original idea brought its own problems, according to Colin.
""When you are changing a game so fundamentally like that, all sorts of problems get introduced.
""You have developed code that is no longer doing what it was originally intended to do. So there's all sorts of problems - the game gets very buggy and crashes a lot, and the team are feeling like the whole process is completely changing and they are not doing what they originally set out to do. 
""But actually, this process of evolving and iterating is what made it feel so dynamic. 
""So although it was a very frustrating process for the team, it meant they could see what really worked, iterate on it and give the game a new direction.
""They also had time to polish it, so they started doing things like adding skid marks and shadows and nice sound effects and the radio stations - all of those things that really brought the world to life.""
Colin says that although GTA only came together in its final six months of development, there were signs that it could connect with a wide audience.
""The team were playing it in their own lunchtimes, which is always a rare thing. 
""After you spend a couple of years developing something, you are usually sick to the back teeth of seeing it - the last thing you want to do is see it again in your spare time."" 
Colin says the sequel he produced involved making technical changes to make the game more ""structurally sound"" and moving the game from being set in the contemporary world. 
""We wanted to make it feel a little bit more futuristic. That gave us more creative licence with the vehicles, with the weapons, with the types of environments you would see. 
""In hindsight, that probably hasn't resonated with audiences as well as the contemporary vehicles and cities. Most of the Grand Theft Auto games have gone back to being set more or less in the present day.""
Colin adds that despite the franchise's birth pangs, there was a sense within the original team that they were on to something.
""We knew we had something special - the fact that the team were playing it in their own time is a really strong indicator of that - but there are countless games that come out every year that are creatively and technically brilliant but just don't sell particularly well, for whatever reason. 
""Most people don't hear about them - they are not quite capturing the zeitgeist of the moment - and Grand Theft Auto could easily have been another one of those.
""It's been quite a surprise to see it still do so well a quarter of a century later.""

politics	Political parties want to appear tough on immigration but numbers tell different story	"In recent days, the prime minister has said immigration should fall. 
Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK's ""immigration dependency"", as he put it, must end.
Even if, in an interview I did with him, he wasn't willing to explicitly say he wanted the numbers to fall.
Sir Keir Starmer says he will not pick ""arbitrary migration targets"" over the number of workers coming to the UK from abroad
And then there are these latest figures. Half a million more people arriving in the UK than leaving in the year to June. Half a million. The highest ever.
ke a step back from the political argument here, and this is an outwardly flattering scenario. A country whose magnetism to so many propels people to our shores in such numbers.
Whatever their circumstances or background, half a million more people concluding their hopes and dreams are better served by moving to the UK than by leaving.
And yet, as so often with the question of immigration, it creates a cascade of political and societal quandaries. 
Opinion polls suggest concerns about immigration eased after the Brexit referendum, but it remains a significant worry for many. 
Not on the scale of the cost of living, the economy or the health service. But important nonetheless.
And none of these issues exist in isolation.
Migration has an impact on these issues too.
It's worth remembering, by the way, that not all political leaders express a desire for the numbers to shrivel. Take the Scottish National Party, for instance, which advocates more immigration.
But for those that do talk about, or at least hint at reducing the numbers, actually delivering that requires difficult decisions. Should fewer international students be allowed in? What about fewer people coming to the UK to work in the NHS? And at what consequence? 
But what too could be the consequence of political rhetoric and observable reality being so out of step, as a swelling population heaps further pressure on school places, the health service and housing?
Almost instantly, the former Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage branded it a disgrace, and said that Reform UK, the successor to the Brexit Party, would field candidates everywhere at the next general election.
Let's see.
One recent opinion poll from Deltapoll does suggest that among Conservative-leaning, Leave-backing voters, asylum and immigration is hugely, hugely important.
So how do those voters, many of whom perhaps backed Leave expecting immigration to fall, respond? 
Who do they blame? And where do they turn? And what do the Conservatives and Labour say now?
Home Secretary Suella Braverman said ""we remain committed to reducing migration over time, in line with our manifesto commitment"".
You may remember the Conservatives long promised to reduce net migration to the tens of thousands, and it never happened.
Labour said there had been Conservative ""mismanagement"" of the asylum and immigration systems. But they themselves have shifted their frontbench view a million miles from where it was. They want to appear robust on immigration.
But can both big parties at Westminster continue saying this stuff with any credibility if the numbers tell a different story?"	/news/uk-politics-63751867

People are also struggling with higher energy bills and rising interest rates. 
Sainsbury's said sales across the business had climbed 4.4% to £16.4bn in the six months ending in September. 
But the UK's second-largest supermarket also revealed a dip in profits as the business absorbed some of the impact of rising food costs and put up wages.
mpany, which also owns Argos, said underlying pre-tax profit declined by 8% to £340m compared with the same period last year.
Mr Roberts said: ""We will have invested more than £500m by March 2023 in keeping prices lower by cutting our costs... meaning we have more firepower to battle inflation.""
grocer's profits also reflect a return to normal shopping habits since the pandemic lockdowns ended.
rice of pasta, tea, chips and cooking oil has soared, according to official data, with vegetable oil going up by 65% in a year.
Overall, the price of budget food in supermarkets rose by 17% in the year to September, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.
Experts say the rise in the cost of groceries has been accelerated by the war in Ukraine, which has disrupted grain, oil and fertiliser supplies from the region.
Food and drink prices have also been affected by the recent weakness in the pound, which has made imported products and ingredients more expensive.
Earlier this month, a BBC survey uncovered growing concern about the squeeze on finances. Some 85% of those asked are now worried about the rising cost of living, up from 69% in a similar poll in January.
Like other supermarkets, Sainsbury's has given its staff two pay rises this year to ""reflect the current challenges households are facing"".
Sainsbury's and Argos hourly retail staff saw their pay rise from £10.00 to £10.25 an hour, and from £11.05 to £11.30 an hour in London.
grocer has said profits for the current year are set to decline as it chooses to invest more into its pricing and pay improvements for workers.
Zoe Gillespie, investment manager at RBC Brewin Dolphin, said Sainsbury's, like its peers, was ""stuck between a rock and a hard place"" as it faced increasing labour costs and the impact of high inflation. 
""Sales have remained robust, but the effects of the macro-economic situation are beginning to filter through into profitability,"" she said. 
Despite this Sainsbury's said it was ""well placed"" for the Christmas trading period, and to deal with further cost-of-living pressures into next year.
group is halfway through a £1.3bn cost-saving programme, which has seen it shut down in-store restaurants and standalone Argos shops.
It said it expected to close about 50 Argos stores this year as part of the previously announced plans, with around 25 Argos sites set to open within larger Sainsbury's shops."	/news/business-63496408
health	Ulster Hospital: Bed pressures 'worse than during Covid'	"Emergency department situation 'worse than during Covid'
urrent pressure on hospital beds is ""worse than it was during Covid"", according to a senior manager at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald.
Seaneen Pettigrew works in the hospital's discharge hub and her role is to free up beds by facilitating the discharge of medically-fit patients.
She said they were having difficulty securing care in the community for vulnerable patients leaving hospital.
Ms Pettigrew said demand for carers ""is currently outstripping supply"".
""We've more patients attending emergency department (ED), we've more patients coming through the hospital and more patients with complex needs who are needing more support on discharge than maybe previously,"" she said.
BBC News NI was granted access to the hospital's discharge hub this week, as well as its emergency department.
On Wednesday afternoon, 135 patients were in the emergency department, with 50 of those waiting for admission to a ward.
At the same time, there were 67 patients in the hospital who were ready to be discharged into the community, but could not leave because of delays securing onward care. 
One patient, who required admission to the hospital, had been waiting nearly 60 hours in the emergency department.
Seven ambulances were also waiting outside with patients onboard.
Andrew Dobbin, a consultant at the Ulster Hospital, warned that patients waiting long periods in emergency departments to be admitted are ""going to come to harm"".
He said there was ""almost a one-in-one out-policy"" due to delays discharging medically-fit patients.
Dr Dobbin said it had become normal to see 50 patients waiting in the department for admission to wards and for hospital staff to be under ""significant pressure"".
""We know, as our Royal College of Emergency Medicine has said, that crowding and long waits in emergency departments are directly linked to harm for patients and we know that patients staying here for long periods of time are going to come to harm.""
He added there were two reasons why emergency departments were facing ""significant problems"".
""The first thing is demand has increased and the second problem, which is the main problem at the moment, is that we have a significant number of patients who need to continue their care in hospital that we cannot move through our system to create the capacity to run an efficient, safe, effective emergency department.""
In the hospital's discharge hub a team of nurses, social workers, administrative staff and occupational therapists work seven days a week sourcing suitable placements for patients who are ready to leave hospital. 
Ms Pettigrew told BBC News NI that the ""picture is worse than it was during Covid"" because of the demand.
""The challenges we are having would be in accessing domiciliary care and sourcing appropriate care homes to facilitate patient discharge, and as a result those patients are delayed in hospital awaiting their care package or care home.""
Ms Pettigrew said the team at the discharge hub were appealing to patients and their families to work with them. 
""Given the challenges we may have to look at an alternative interim bed to go to, to await your package or await your home of choice.
""We know its not ideal, but it frees up the hospital bed for those patients waiting to come in through ED to also get the treatment that your loved one will have had.""
rge hub manager said there was a need to increase the number of care workers both within care homes and the domiciliary care sector. 
""It is a very complex issue within domiciliary care, the demand for the service is outstripping what's available at the minute.
""And then within our care home sector it is the appropriate care home placements for patients - potentially those who have complex nursing needs, complex behavioural needs.  It's trying to source the right placements for those patients,"" Ms Pettigrew explained. 
Separately, the number of people waiting for a first appointment with a consultant increased by 20,000 in a year, according to the latest figures from the Department of Health. 
More than 375,000 people were waiting to see a specialist at the end of September, up more than 5% from the same time last year.
Department of Health said its target by March next year is that at least 50% of people should not be waiting any longer than nine weeks for a first outpatient appointment.
urrent number of patients waiting longer than nine weeks is 82%, with over half of people on a waiting list for more than a year.
figures also show that almost 124,000 people were waiting to be admitted to hospital for inpatient or day care treatment.
And almost 164,000 patients were still waiting for a diagnostic test at the end of September - up 11% on the same time last year."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63746844
business	Average two-year mortgage rate highest for 14 years	"rest rate on a typical two-year fixed rate mortgage has breached 6% for the first time in 14 years.
rate of 6.07%, the financial information service Moneyfacts says, a level not seen since the financial crisis in November 2008. 
Mortgage rates have been going up for months, but recorded a sharp increase in response to the fall-out from the mini-budget nearly two weeks ago.
First-time buyers and those looking to remortgage are affected.
An average of at least 100,000 people a month are coming to the end of their current mortgage, and face a significant rise in their monthly repayments.
""Borrowers may well be concerned about the rise to fixed mortgage rates but it is essential they seek advice to assess the deals that are available to them right now,"" said Rachel Springall from Moneyfacts.
""Fixing for longer may seem more appealing, particularly as both the average two- and five-year fixed rates rise to levels not seen in over a decade. Consumers must carefully consider whether now is the right time to buy a home or to wait and see how things change in the coming weeks.""
Brokers say lenders are ""playing safe"" with rates amid current economic uncertainty, but costs could eventually start to dip.
Uncertainty over future interest rates after the mini-budget led lenders to pull more than a thousand deals from the market. 
re slowly starting to return - there were 3,961 products a fortnight ago, now there are 2,371 - but have become more expensive on average.
Representatives from High Street banks and mortgage lenders are meeting Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng on Thursday, with the current situation facing borrowers on the agenda. It is understood that this is the latest in a regular series of discussions.
Bosses from Barclays, Natwest and Lloyds Banking Group are expected to attend.
rest rate on a new, average two-year fixed deal on the morning of the speech was 4.74%, compared with 6.07% now. That is a difference of about £170 a month on repayments for somebody borrowing £200,000 on a 30-year mortgage.
A five-year fixed deal has typically risen from 4.75% to 5.97% over the same period.
will be much greater when compared to a borrower's previous deal taken out two or five years ago.
Some more specialist lenders, whose customers may include those with a chequered credit history or the recently self-employed, have been raising rates to 6.5-7% or more.
In the meantime, the average standards variable rate - which by nature are changeable and are paid by 900,000 homeowners - has gone up from 4.41% at the start of the year to 5.63% at the start of October.
During her speech at the Conservative Party conference, Prime Minister Liz Truss said that the government ""will do what we can"" to support homeowners. However, she said that the benchmark interest rate was set independently by the Bank of England."	/news/business-63144506
health	Industrial action by health workers in NI begins	"Healthcare workers from two of Northern Ireland's biggest unions have begun industrial action in a dispute about pay.
Nipsa members started ""indefinite action short of strike"" on Monday.
Unison members are taking similar action on Monday and will follow that with a one-day strike on 12 December.
unions announced their action after the Royal College of Nursing said its members would strike on 15 and 20 December.
Nipsa members are taking the action over three issues: pay, staffing levels within the health service and travel reimbursement.
Unison's action is over pay for its members.
Health workers in Northern Ireland have yet to receive an increase in pay for the 2022-23 financial year.
In July an independent pay review body recommended that they should receive a rise of £1,400.
Unison representative Anne Speed told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme the union was seeking an ""inflation-busting pay rise"" for its members.
""What it means is inflation is 11%, and a pay rise actually has to match that in order to protect workers,"" she said.
""What's being awarded is only half of inflation, and health workers are just frustrated, fed up, very disappointed and they're choosing to speak out now.""
Ms Speed added that unions were prepared to negotiate, but the responsibility fell on Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, due political stalemate at Stormont.
Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) withdrew from the executive earlier this year in protest over the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is part of the Brexit deal.
In England and Wales, NHS staff have been given a rise of at least £1,400.
Unions in Scotland are considering a government offer averaging 7.5%.
re are several reasons why workers are taking industrial action, including the failure by the Stormont executive to trigger a pay increase while the cost of living soars.
Workers in the Unison and Nipsa unions want staff shortages addressed and feel their efforts during the pandemic should be recognised financially.
It will take a lot to resolve the industrial dispute.
But the unions say that for starters, in the absence of devolved government, civil servants could agree to pay workers the recommended rate that has been granted elsewhere.
Nipsa and Unison action will take the form of work to rule - members will only take on work required in their contracts.
Nipsa deputy general secretary Pádraig Mulholland said those who were taking the action were the ""heroes who brought us through Covid and are now standing up for the health service"".
He said that during the action members would:
Unison said its members were frustrated and angry and ""are now the lowest paid part of the UK NHS workforce"".
union said the cost-of-living crisis was biting deep and it was foolish to assume workers would ""suck it up"".
Regarding the strike planned for 12 December, Unison said employers would be advised in the coming days of the full scope of the action.
In a joint statement the unions said the safety of health service patients was ""very important for health staff who will take industrial action"".
""Discussions have already begun to ensure the employers take the necessary steps to protect patients during the dispute,"" they said.
Stormont's Department of Health said the health authorities would work to protect critical services as much as possible during the industrial action.
But it warned that there would ""inevitably be an impact on patient care"".
Health staff in Northern Ireland last went on strike in late 2019 and early 2020 in protest over pay and staffing levels."	/news/uk-northern-ireland-63796570
entertainment	Paramore 'needed a break to find our identity', says Hayley Williams	"After four years away, Paramore are back with a new song and album, both called This Is Why.
It's a title inspired by world events, according to singer Hayley Williams.
""Every time I can't believe [something] is happening, whether it's planet, politics, social stuff, I'm always, 'this is why we can't have nice things'.""
33-year-old says the break allowed her and the band to reflect and think about everything around them.
""We all really needed it to find our identity apart from Paramore and all the public projection we get in our life,"" she told Radio 1's Future Sounds with Clara Amfo.
""I learned how introverted I really am.""
weekend Hayley, guitarist Taylor York and drummer Zac Farro will be playing their first live shows in more than four years.
Hayley says the time during Covid, when much of the world was forced inside, helped her to reconnect with her roots.
""I don't think I would have slowed down, gotten time with my family,"" she says.
""I was glad we were home because we were part of our own community in Nashville, and we got to be a part of it as citizens, as friends, a daughter, a sister and it wasn't really about Paramore.""
""None of us knew we were going to be forced all the way inside.""
But time away in isolation didn't stop the band from thinking about their fans, and importantly building their album.
""I think if you talk to anybody, it was such a ridiculously tragic time,"" Hayley says.
I thought about the fans, the shows, the whole time we were writing the entire album.""
And the UK was at the forefront of their minds.
""We just have such a cool relationship with our fans around the world. But there is something really special about the UK and the lineage of bands that are from there."" 
""We were really digging up our oldest influences from across the pond. And every time I would imagine playing a show it was some festival in the UK or some crowd that we played in places like Manchester."" 
As for touring the country in 2023? She teases ""it won't be long"".
""We already have the plan,"" she says.
""And I cannot wait for people to find out who we're playing with. I'm just so excited to get back over there.""

business	'Warning lights flash' as more workers seek help, says Citizens Advice	"""warning lights are flashing red"" as the number of people in work seeking crisis support has more than doubled in two years, according to a charity.
Citizens Advice says it referred 6,983 employed people for crisis support between July and September this year.
mpares with 2,780 people in the same period in 2020.
figures come as the cost of living is rising at the fastest rate for 40 years.
""Every day, our advisers hear stories of people skipping meals, going without essentials and then coming to us when they simply can't cut back any more. This cannot continue"", said Morgan Wild, Head of Policy at Citizens Advice. 
""We have seen the difference government support can have but the warning lights are still flashing red for the future,"" he added.
rity also said that the number of people supported this year so far had already exceeded those across the last three years. 
figures also represent a sharp from last year, when 4,291 people were referred in the third quarter.
rity also warned that the number of people it is supporting could triple if the government decides not to raise benefits in line with inflation, which measures the cost of living.
government has not committed to raising benefits using this measure but the chancellor is expected to announce its decision in the Autumn Statement on 17 November.
Just over 9,000 unemployed people have received crisis support from the charity in the third quarter of this year, compared to 6,190 last year, according to its latest cost of living data.
f living is increasing at the fastest rate for 40 years, largely as a result of energy and food prices going up, with inflation currently stood at 10.1%.
A government scheme to limit typical household energy bills to £2,500 a year has been in place since October, but is due to end in April next year, with more targeted help to follow. 
In England, Scotland and Wales, everyone's energy bills are being cut by £400 over six months, with an additional £650 of support for lower-income households.
Citizens Advice said its data shows the government support is helping but that the impact is limited according to its figures, and there's concern about what happens when support measures end.
""We need action which matches the scale of this crisis. At a minimum, benefits must be increased in line with inflation at next week's Autumn Statement and further energy support should be offered to those on the lowest incomes,"" Mr Wild said.
rity said that as energy bills have risen, more and more people are looking for practical advice on how to make their homes more energy efficient to reduce costs.
Consumer Affairs Correspondent Colletta Smith has some tips for cutting costs in your home.
It is also continuing to see record numbers of pre-pay gas and electricity customers who cannot afford to top up their meters. 
It saw a small fall in the number of people who couldn't afford to top up their pre-payment meters in October, which it attributes to the first tranche of the government support payments, but added it was still the third highest month on record. 
So far this year, the charity has already seen more people unable to top up than the total number of people seen in the five previous years combined. 
In addition to the number of people unable to top up, the charity said it was concerned about the high number of people having pre-payment meters forcibly installed because they're falling into debt with their energy companies. 
week, the BBC reported that a rising number of households are having their energy smart meters remotely switched to pre-payment meters by their supplier, without their permission. 
Citizens Advice said that energy debt is on the rise, with its total value now almost twice what it was in 2019 and that overall, it had never seen a higher proportion of people in negative budget - with more essential spending going out, than income coming in. "	/news/business-63598748
health	Ellie Simmonds: A World Without Dwarfism? - documentary explores views on new drug	"""I'm worried that this drug could be the end of dwarfism altogether,"" says Ellie Simmonds in new BBC documentary, Ellie Simmonds: A World Without Dwarfism?
In the programme, which airs on BBC One on Tuesday 5 April at 21:00 BST, the 27-year-old five-time Paralympic Champion explores a new drug called vosoritide, which has been developed to treat children with achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism.
rug is already available in the US and the NHS has run trials for a potential roll-out in the United Kingdom.
Whilst many see the drug as a helpful breakthrough, Simmonds has concerns that it could potentially, ""eradicate dwarfism"". 
""Is it about changing who we are? I'm not a fan of that,"" she says early on in the film.
Simmonds was born with achondroplasia, which stunts growth in arms and legs. She has achieved massive sporting success, including eight Paralympic medals and 14 World Championship gold medals.
""If I wasn't a dwarf, I wouldn't have gone to the Paralympics and made a career as an athlete that way,"" she recently told BBC Sport, ""so I thought, 'gosh, if this drug was around when I was a kid, would I actually be who I am today?'""
Over the course of the documentary, Simmonds meets parents and children in the UK and US who are using vosoritide, in order to explore their motives and experiences. She also meets people with dwarfism who oppose its roll-out. 
After filming the documentary, Simmonds spoke to BBC Sport about how she felt after hearing from all of these different opinions.
""It's great that people have choice,"" she said. However, she added: ""If I had a child, because I knew what it's like having dwarfism, I wouldn't choose the drug.""
rity Restricted Growth Association UK defines achondroplasiaexternal-link as a rare genetic condition that causes poor bone growth, resulting in shortened limbs. The average height of someone with achondroplasia is around four feet.
Most children with achondroplasia are born to average size parents and many live healthy lives. There are some medical complications associated with achondroplasia, however.
As set out by to Great Ormond Street Hospitalexternal-link, infants with achondroplasia often have a curve in the lower spine, that may require a brace and some also develop bow legs, which can be treated with surgery. RGUK lists some more rare associated problems as hearing impairment, breathing problems in young children, hydrocephalus, spinal stenosis, leading to compression of nerves to the limbs.
Vosoritide is designed to improve growth in children with achondroplasia, who have open epiphyses (growth plates), meaning they have the potential to grow. Patients take a daily dose and have regular check-ups.
rug may cause serious side effects including a temporary decrease in blood pressure in some patients.
Last November, vosoritide was approved for use in the US, for children over the age of five and in the EU, for children over two.
A year of injections are reportedexternal-link to cost around $332,000 (£240,000).
During the film, Simmonds expresses concern that some parents of children with achondroplasia may want to use the drug irrespective of whether their child suffers any associated health problems.
Simmonds meets others in the dwarfism community who share those concerns, including American couple Joe Stramondo and Leah Smith.
""The assumption is that dwarfism is a problem that needs to be fixed,"" says Joe, in the film, adding, ""largely, the folks in the dwarfism community celebrate our differences"".
In order to get a better idea of why the drug is being trialled, Simmonds meets with Dr Melita Irving, who led the UK trials at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. Simmonds wants to know what the metrics of success are.
""The main thing that we measure is growth,"" Irving explains. ""If your bones are growing, that's because they're responding to the drug.""
As per the European Medicines Agencyexternal-link, from a sample of 121 children aged 5-17, those who received vosoritide grew about 1.57cm more during the one year of treatment than those receiving a placebo. The results also suggested that the improvement in growth is maintained while using the drug. The recommendation is to use injections until the patient is unlikely to grow any further.
As to fears about what implications this may have for the dwarfism community, Irving suggests that the aim is to deal with health complications.
""The intention with trialling this drug is not to eradicate dwarfism,"" she tells Simmonds. 
""Yes, dwarfism is an identity, but I also see achondroplasia as being linked with significant medical problems as well and so, one of the purposes of trialling this drug is to see if we can eradicate those complications, rather than eradicate dwarfism,"" she adds.
In 2019, the Restricted Growth Association UK published a statementexternal-link saying they would ""support any medical advancements that reduce the health complications of people with achondroplasia, avoid surgery, remove chronic pain and allow people to live every aspect of their lives to the fullest.""
However, they also added that they do not view increased height as ""an important outcome"" and that, ""if it is shown that this is the only benefit of vosoritide and there is no reduction in the health complications,"" they would no longer support the development of the drug.
During the film, Simmonds meets some of those involved in the NHS trial.
One of those children is 10-year-old Talia. Since taking the medication, she has grown six centimetres in 12 months, which is two centimetres more than the average for a child her age with dwarfism.
Her mother Rocana cites different reasons for participating, including that increased limb length allows her daughter to perform tasks like running or catching more easily. She also speaks about health problems that Talia faced earlier in life, including bowed legs, spinal problems and sleep apnoea.
In California, Simmonds meets the Haider family, who enrolled on the US trial of vosoritide and are strong advocates. Ahmin, 12, who has used the drug for three years, describes why he wants to continue.
""I'm satisfied with who I am, but I want to be better,"" he tells Simmonds. ""Being taller will give me opportunities, it will make my life easier, it would put me on a level playing field with more people,"" he adds.
majority of children with achondroplasia are born to average height parents and one of the delicate questions the film navigates is around those parents making decisions on behalf of their children.
""When they've been living every day as average height parents, they don't know what it's actually like to live with dwarfism,"" Simmonds said. 
However, she did also say that it had to be down to the legal guardians to make these calls.
For Simmonds, it is important to show that dwarfism is not something that needs to be ""cured"".
""As a dwarfism community, we have a role to play when it comes to parents who are nervous and unsure about what their child's life is going to be like. We need to show people that it's not all doom and gloom.""
Simmonds told BBC Sport that she has always felt happy with her own body. From a very young age, she has been involved in sport.
""I went to my first World Championships in 2006, when I was 12; the Beijing 2008 Olympics when I was 13; at London 2012, I was 17,"" she said. 
""I was at peak performance. My body was my tool - it was something that won me gold medals, so I never saw it in a negative way.""
However, she appreciates that not everyone has had such a happy experience.
One of the challenging scenes in the film is when Simmonds chats to her team-mate Will Perry, who also has achondroplasia. 
Perry has spoken publicly about the abuse he has received because of his dwarfism.
He admits that there are times when he wishes he was average height.
""I always get asked the question, 'if you could swap to be a normal person, would you?',"" he tells Simmonds.
""For me, it's 50/50. When we're out at the Paralympics, collecting amazing experiences, you go, 'no, not for the world', but then, when you get in the situations I've been campaigning for more recently, when you have to miss out on things like team sports such as rugby and football, it makes you think, 'actually I really wish I was normal'.""
Simmonds says that it's been eye-opening to speak to people with different experiences.
""I feel very lucky that I haven't really gone through that because of who I am.""
Vosoritide is awaiting National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) approval in the UK.
On the NICE websiteexternal-link, it says: ""The scoping exercise will be rescheduled to take place at a later date in 2023.""
When asked what she would like for people to take away from watching the film, Simmonds replied: ""I want people to see that, yes, society is different and that's amazing. Let's embrace that. Don't treat anyone differently - we're all human beings."""	/sport/swimming/60934176

politics	Labour MP Ian Byrne reselected as Liverpool West Derby candidate	"An MP who had faced a battle to be chosen to represent Labour at the next election has been reselected as the party's candidate.
Ian Byrne, who has represented Liverpool West Derby since 2019, was announced as the winner of a ballot on Sunday. 
He had had to compete for the seat after losing a series of votes in local constituency branches.
Mr Byrne and the Labour Party have been approached for a comment by the BBC.
MP had faced competition from Liverpool councillor Anthony Lavelle and Lancashire councillor Kimberley Whitehead.
During the contest, he accused Mr Lavelle's supporters of ""intimidation"", a claim which was strongly denied by the councillor's backers.
Mr Byrne was first selected to replace the previous Labour MP Stephen Twigg in early 2019.
At the time, he was a local ward councillor in Everton and was a vocal supporter of then-party leader Jeremy Corbyn.
He is a member of the Socialist Campaign Group of backbench Labour MPs and is a familiar face on match days on Merseyside, collecting donations for the charity he set up, Fans Supporting Foodbanks.
In Parliament, he has campaigned for a right to food to be established in law and for the Hillsborough disaster to be added to the national curriculum.
Ian Byrne is part of the Socialist Campaign Group parliamentary caucus of Labour MPs - made up of MPs on the left of the Labour party. 
Some Labour left-wingers, including supporters of the former leader Jeremy Corbyn, have claimed in recent months they are being frozen out of standing for the party at the next general election as Sir Keir Starmer seeks to remake the party in his own image. 
But a Labour spokesperson previously said that the party's ""due diligence is about weeding out candidates who could cause electoral damage"".
However, the fact Mr Byrne was not automatically selected prompted criticism by Labour's left - including the group Momentum, who said that despite ""a deeply flawed trigger ballot process which broke with basic principles of fairness"", he had ""roared back to victory"".
""also struck a blow... against an out-of-control Starmer machine willing to break Labour's own rules, disregard trade unions and attack its own MPs in the service of their right-wing purge"".
